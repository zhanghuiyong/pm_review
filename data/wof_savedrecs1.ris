AB  - Recently, thyroid disease has been a leading cause of mortality, underscoring the importance of early diagnosis to mitigate its impact. Researchers have randomly employed static selection ensemble methods aiming to forecast the disease in its initial stages. However, the use of such ensemble methods in healthcare diagnosis poses challenges related to performance consistency and potential mismatches with new data characteristics. Hence, this paper proposes a novel approach by introducing the Dynamic Selection Hybrid Model (DSHM) that leverages the most effective conventional classifiers using an appropriate ensemble method. Instead of going the conventional way, we evaluate various baseline classifiers to demonstrate their impact on the characteristics selected by two robust feature selection techniques. This evaluation employs an explainable AI (XAI) method, Permutation Feature Importance (PFI), and selects the most effective classifiers based on their characteristics impact. Then the selected classifiers are integrated by an appropriate ensemble method, based on a comparative evaluation between four efficient ensemble methods. Allowing the proposed DSHM to dynamically adjust its composition based on selecting conditions can potentially achieve robust performance by better adaptability on unseen data. Before the training DSHM, the methodology begins by addressing the dataset's imbalance issue using an effective data balancing method BOO-ST. To demonstrate the superiority of DSHM, various performance evaluation matrices, and a statistical test are employed. The experimental results reveal the effectiveness of our proposed DSHM, outperformed with an impressive 99.33% accuracy. Finally, to enhance transparency, trust, and patient outcomes, we applied the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) to explain DSHM-provided outcomes. With a robust classification performance, our proposed DSHM aims to explain its outcomes, contributing to improved clinical decision-making processes and ultimately enhancing patient care.

AB  - The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) into healthcare systems improves patient care, boosts operational efficiency, and contributes to cost-effective healthcare delivery. However, overcoming several associated challenges, such as data security, interoperability, and ethical concerns, is crucial to realizing the full potential of IoT in healthcare. Real-time anomaly detection plays a key role in protecting patient data and maintaining device integrity amidst the additional security risks posed by interconnected systems. In this context, this paper presents a novel method for healthcare data privacy analysis. The technique is based on the identification of anomalies in cloud-based Internet of Things (IoT) networks, and it is optimized using explainable artificial intelligence. For anomaly detection, the Radial Boltzmann Gaussian Temporal Fuzzy Network (RBGTFN) is used in the process of doing information privacy analysis for healthcare data. Remora Colony Swarm Optimization is then used to carry out the optimization of the network. The performance of the model in identifying anomalies across a variety of healthcare data is evaluated by an experimental study. This evaluation suggested that the model measures the accuracy, precision, latency, Quality of Service (QoS), and scalability of the model. A remarkable 95% precision, 93% latency, 89% quality of service, 98% detection accuracy, and 96% scalability were obtained by the suggested model, as shown by the subsequent findings.

AB  - Lung and colon cancers lead to a significant portion of deaths. Their simultaneous occurrence is uncommon, however, in the absence of early diagnosis, the metastasis of cancer cells is very high between these two organs. Currently, histopathological diagnosis and appropriate treatment are the only way to improve the chances of survival and reduce cancer mortality. Using artificial intelligence in the histopathological diagnosis of colon and lung cancer can provide significant help to specialists in identifying cases of colon and lung cancers with less effort, time and cost. The objective of this study is to set up a computer-aided diagnostic system that can accurately classify five types of colon and lung tissues (two classes for colon cancer and three classes for lung cancer) by analyzing their histopathological images. Using machine learning, features engineering and image processing techniques, the six models XGBoost, SVM, RF, LDA, MLP and LightGBM were used to perform the classification of histopathological images of lung and colon cancers that were acquired from the LC25000 dataset. The main advantage of using machine learning models is that they allow a better interpretability of the classification model since they are based on feature engineering; however, deep learning models are black box networks whose working is very difficult to understand due to the complex network design. The acquired experimental results show that machine learning models give satisfactory results and are very precise in identifying classes of lung and colon cancer subtypes. The XGBoost model gave the best performance with an accuracy of 99% and a F1-score of 98.8%. The implementation and the development of this model will help healthcare specialists identify types of colon and lung cancers. The code will be available upon request.

AB  - Recent developments in machine learning algorithms have enabled models to exhibit impressive performance in healthcare tasks using electronic health record (EHR) data. However, the heterogeneous nature and sparsity of EHR data remains challenging. In this work, we present a model that utilizes heterogeneous data and addresses sparsity by representing diagnoses, procedures, and medication codes with temporal Hierarchical Clinical Embeddings combined with Topic modeling (HCET) on clinical notes. HCET aggregates various categories of EHR data and learns inherent structure based on hospital visits for an individual patient. We demonstrate the potential of the approach in the task of predicting depression at various time points prior to a clinical diagnosis. We found that HCET outperformed all baseline methods with a highest improvement of 0.07 in precision-recall area under the curve (PRAUC). Furthermore, applying attention weights across EHR data modalities significantly improved the performance as well as the model's interpretability by revealing the relative weight for each data modality. Our results demonstrate the model's ability to utilize heterogeneous EHR information to predict depression, which may have future implications for screening and early detection.

AB  - This article presents an innovative approach that leverages interpretable machine learning models and cloud computing to accelerate the detection of septic shock by analyzing electronic health data. Unlike traditional methods, which often lack transparency in decision-making, our approach focuses on early detection, offering a proactive strategy to mitigate the risks of sepsis. By integrating advanced machine learning algorithms with interpretability techniques, our method not only provides accurate predictions but also offers clear insights into the factors influencing the model's decisions. Moreover, we introduce a preference-based matching algorithm to evaluate disease severity, enabling timely interventions guided by the analysis outcomes. This innovative integration significantly enhances the effectiveness of our approach. We leverage a clinical health dataset comprising 1,552,210 Electronic Health Records (EHR) to train our interpretable machine learning models within a cloud computing framework. Through techniques like feature importance analysis and model-agnostic interpretability tools, we aim to clarify the crucial indicators contributing to septic shock prediction. This transparency not only assists healthcare professionals in comprehending the model's predictions but also facilitates the integration of our system into existing clinical workflows. We validate the effectiveness of our interpretable models using the same dataset, achieving an impressive accuracy rate exceeding 98% through the application of oversampling techniques. The findings of this study hold significant implications for the advancement of more effective and transparent diagnostic tools in the critical domain of sepsis management.

AB  - Integrating large language models (LLMs) to retrieve targeted medical knowledge from electronic health records enables significant advancements in medical research. However, recognizing the challenges associated with using LLMs in healthcare is essential for successful implementation. One challenge is that medical records combine unstructured textual information with highly sensitive personal data. This, in turn, highlights the need for explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods to understand better how LLMs function in the medical domain. In this study, we propose a novel XAI tool to accelerate data-driven cancer research. We apply the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model to German language pathology reports examining the effects of domain-specific language adaptation and fine-tuning. We demonstrate our model on a real-world pathology dataset, analyzing the contextual representations of diagnostic reports. By illustrating decisions made by fine-tuned models, we provide decision values that can be applied in medical research. To address interpretability, we conduct a performance evaluation of the classifications generated by our fine-tuned model, as assessed by an expert pathologist. In domains such as medicine, inspection of the medical knowledge map in conjunction with expert evaluation reveals valuable information about how contextual representations of key disease features are categorized. This ultimately benefits data structuring and labeling and paves the way for even more advanced approaches to XAI, combining text with other input modalities, such as images which are then applicable to various engineering problems.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enhanced histopathology presents unprecedented opportunities to benefit oncology through interpretable methods that require only one overall label per hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slide with no tissue-level annotations. We present a structured review of these methods organized by their degree of verifiability and by commonly recurring application areas in oncological characterization. First, we discuss morphological markers (tumor presence/absence, metastases, subtypes, grades) in which AI-identified regions of interest (ROIs) within whole slide images (WSIs) verifiably overlap with pathologist-identified ROIs. Second, we discuss molecular markers (gene expression, molecular subtyping) that are not verified via H&E but rather based on overlap with positive regions on adjacent tissue. Third, we discuss genetic markers (mutations, mutational burden, microsatellite instability, chromosomal instability) that current technologies cannot verify if AI methods spatially resolve specific genetic alterations. Fourth, we discuss the direct prediction of survival to which AIidentified histopathological features quantitatively correlate but are nonetheless not mechanistically verifiable. Finally, we discuss in detail several opportunities and challenges for these one-label-per-slide methods within oncology. Opportunities include reducing the cost of research and clinical care, reducing the workload of clinicians, personalized medicine, and unlocking the full potential of histopathology through new imaging-based biomarkers. Current challenges include explainability and interpretability, validation via adjacent tissue sections, reproducibility, data availability, computational needs, data requirements, domain adaptability, external validation, dataset imbalances, and finally commercialization and clinical potential. Ultimately, the relative ease and minimum upfront cost with which relevant data can be collected in addition to the plethora of available AI methods for outcome-driven analysis will surmount these current limitations and achieve the innumerable opportunities associated with AI-driven histopathology for the benefit of oncology.

TI  - Stop explaining black box machine learning models for high stakes decisions and use interpretable models instead
T2  - NATURE MACHINE INTELLIGENCE

KW  - RECIDIVISM
KW  - CAPACITY
AB  - Black box machine learning models are currently being used for high-stakes decision making throughout society, causing problems in healthcare, criminal justice and other domains. Some people hope that creating methods for explaining these black box models will alleviate some of the problems, but trying to explain black box models, rather than creating models that are interpretable in the first place, is likely to perpetuate bad practice and can potentially cause great harm to society. The way forward is to design models that are inherently interpretable. This Perspective clarifies the chasm between explaining black boxes and using inherently interpretable models, outlines several key reasons why explainable black boxes should be avoided in high-stakes decisions, identifies challenges to interpretable machine learning, and provides several example applications where interpretable models could potentially replace black box models in criminal justice, healthcare and computer vision.
   There has been a recent rise of interest in developing methods for 'explainable AI', where models are created to explain how a first 'black box' machine learning model arrives at a specific decision. It can be argued that instead efforts should be directed at building inherently interpretable models in the first place, in particular where they are applied in applications that directly affect human lives, such as in healthcare and criminal justice.

AB  - Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a long-lasting and progressive brain disorder that disrupts the body's nervous system pathways. This disruption leads to various issues with movement and control, leading to various symptoms, including tremors, stiffness, and difficulty with movement and coordination. In the early stages of this condition, the patients struggle to speak and also speak slowly. Dysphonia, a speech impairment or alteration in speech, is experienced by 70 to 90 percent of Parkinson's patients and is an early indication of the disease. Hence, speech can be a vital modality for an early stage of PD diagnosis. In literature, various Machine Learning models are implemented for PD diagnosis based on speech data. However, issues like class imbalance, feature selection, and interpretable prediction analysis are not addressed effectively. Moreover, the accuracy and trustworthiness of the prediction results are essential for providing better healthcare services. Thus, we propose an Interpretable Feature Ranking XGBoost (IFRX) model that effectively addresses the above-mentioned issues. The proposed model has a sequence of processes, such as data preprocessing, class balancing, feature selection, classification, and eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). We trained the IFRX model based on speech data, which ranks the relevant features, builds an XGBoost classifier and ranked the features according to their relevance in diagnosing PD using Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Using the proposed model, we implemented eight Machine Learning classifiers for PD diagnosis based on speech data. Among these classifiers, the XGBoost approach shows better prediction performance with an accuracy of 96.61%.

AB  - Aim: To systematically evaluate the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies on reducing medication errors in nursing practice, focusing on tools such as clinical decision support systems (CDSS), smart infusion pumps, barcode scanning and automated prescription validation. Background: Medication errors are a persistent threat to patient safety and a major burden on healthcare systems. Nurses, who are central to the medication administration process, remain vulnerable to human error. AI offers new opportunities to enhance safety through real-time decision support and predictive analytics. Design: A systematic review following PRISMA 2020 guidelines and using a mixed-methods approach to integrate quantitative outcomes with qualitative insights from nursing practice. Methods: Studies published in English between January 2013 and March 2024 were retrieved from PubMed, ScienceDirect and CINAHL. Eligibility was guided by the PICO framework. Quality appraisal tools appropriate to study designs were applied. Results: Twelve studies were included. CDSS reduced operating room errors by up to 95 %, while smart infusion pumps reduced IV medication errors by approximately 80 %. Prescription validation tools led to a 55 % reduction in prescribing errors. AI-driven alert filtering decreased non-actionable alerts by 45 %. Qualitative data revealed both appreciation of AI's utility and concerns about algorithmic bias, system usability and trust. Conclusions: AI technologies significantly improve medication safety in nursing. However, successful implementation depends on nurse training, system integration, ethical safeguards and workflow alignment. Further experimental studies are needed to validate efficacy and address barriers such as alert fatigue, algorithm transparency and adoption resistance.

AB  - According to size, shape, echogenicity and other ultrasonographic features, physicians can determine whether thyroid nodules are malignant or not. However, the diagnosis results might vary due to differences in physicians' expertise and experience. This paper focuses on ultrasound diagnosis of benign and malignant thyroid nodules by introducing several classical machine learning methods. These machine learning methods can establish intelligent diagnosis models to determine the conditions of new cases based on the knowledge learned from the existing ultrasound data and the confirmed diagnosis results. This paper compares and analyzes the diagnosis performance between intelligent methods and physicians as well as the performance of different machine learning methods in terms of the diagnosis accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and other metrics experimentally. Except for the decision tree, the accuracies of all of the intelligent diagnostic methods are approximately 0.84, and the AUCs are greater than 0.87, which are comparable with physicians' decision accuracies. Different intelligent methods have different characteristics. For example, some learn fast, and some have better interpretability. The study shows that machine learning-based intelligent diagnosis methods can provide physicians with clinical decision support in the diagnosis of thyroid nodules.

TI  - survex: an R package for explaining machine learning survival models
T2  - BIOINFORMATICS
LA  - English
AB  - Due to their flexibility and superior performance, machine learning models frequently complement and outperform traditional statistical survival models. However, their widespread adoption is hindered by a lack of user-friendly tools to explain their internal operations and prediction rationales. To tackle this issue, we introduce the survex R package, which provides a cohesive framework for explaining any survival model by applying explainable artificial intelligence techniques. The capabilities of the proposed software encompass understanding and diagnosing survival models, which can lead to their improvement. By revealing insights into the decision-making process, such as variable effects and importances, survex enables the assessment of model reliability and the detection of biases. Thus, transparency and responsibility may be promoted in sensitive areas, such as biomedical research and healthcare applications.

AB  - The healthcare sector has been revolutionized by blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. AI uses algorithms, recommender systems, decision-making abilities, and big data to display a patient's health records using blockchain. Healthcare professionals can make use of blockchain to display a patient's medical records with a secured medical diagnostic process. Traditionally, data owners have been hesitant to share medical and personal information due to concerns about privacy and trustworthiness. Using blockchain technology, this paper presents an innovative model for integrating healthcare data sharing into a recommender diagnostic computer system. Using the model, medical records can be secured, controlled, authenticated, and kept confidential. In this paper, researchers propose a framework for using the Ethereum blockchain and Xrays as a mechanism for access control, establishing hierarchical identities, and using pre-processing and deep learning to diagnose coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Along with solving the challenges associated with centralized access control systems, this mechanism also ensures data transparency and traceability, which will allow for efficient diagnosis and secure data sharing.

AB  - Generative image models have revolutionized artificial intelligence by enabling the synthesis of high-quality, realistic images. These models utilize deep learning techniques to learn complex data distributions and generate novel images that closely resemble the training dataset. Recent advancements, particularly in diffusion models, have led to remarkable improvements in image fidelity, diversity, and controllability. In this work, we investigate the application of a conditional latent diffusion model in the healthcare domain. Specifically, we trained a latent diffusion model using unlabeled histopathology images. Initially, these images were embedded into a lower-dimensional latent space using a Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Network (VQ-GAN). Subsequently, a diffusion process was applied within this latent space, and clustering was performed on the resulting latent features. The clustering results were then used as a conditioning mechanism for the diffusion model, enabling conditional image generation. Finally, we determined the optimal number of clusters using cluster validation metrics and assessed the quality of the synthetic images through quantitative methods. To enhance the interpretability of the synthetic image generation process, expert input was incorporated into the cluster assignments.

AB  - In recent years, knowledge graphs (KGs) have been considered pyramids of interconnected data enriched with semantics for complex decision-making. The potential of KGs and the demand for interpretability of machine learning (ML) models in diverse domains (e.g., healthcare) have gained more attention. The lack of model transparency negatively impacts the understanding and, in consequence, interpretability of the predictions made by a model. Data-driven models should be empowered with the knowledge required to trace down their decisions and the transformations made to the input data to increase model transparency. In this paper, we propose InterpretME, a tool that using KGs, provides finegrained representations of trained ML models. An ML model description includes data - (e.g., features' definition and SHACL validation) and model-based characteristics (e.g., relevant features and interpretations of prediction probabilities and model decisions). InterpretME allows for defining a model's features over data collected in various formats, e.g., RDF KGs, CSV, and JSON. InterpretME relies on the SHACL schema to validate integrity constraints over the input data. InterpretME traces the steps of data collection, curation, integration, and prediction; it documents the collected metadata in the InterpretME KG. InterpretME is published in GitHub(1) and Zenodo(2). The InterpretME framework includes a pipeline for enhancing the interpretability of ML models, the InterpretME KG, and an ontology to describe the main characteristics of trained ML models; a PyPI library of InterpretME is also provided(3). Additionally, a live code(4), and a video(5) demonstrating InterpretME in several use cases are also available.

AB  - We present an interpretable machine learning model for medical diagnosis called sparse high-order interaction model with rejection option (SHIMR). A decision tree explains to a patient the diagnosis with a long rule (i.e., conjunction of many intervals), while SHIMR employs a weighted sum of short rules. Using proteomics data of 151 subjects in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, SHIMR is shown to be as accurate as other non-interpretable methods (Sensitivity, SN = 0.84 +/- 0.1, Specificity, SP = 0.69 +/- 0.15 and Area Under the Curve, AUC = 0.86 +/- 0.09). For clinical usage, SHIMR has a function to abstain from making any diagnosis when it is not confident enough, so that a medical doctor can choose more accurate but invasive and/or more costly pathologies. The incorporation of a rejection option complements SHIMR in designing a multistage cost-effective diagnosis framework. Using a baseline concentration of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma proteins from a common cohort of 141 subjects, SHIMR is shown to be effective in designing a patient-specific cost-effective Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Thus, interpretability, reliability and having the potential to design a patient-specific multistage cost-effective diagnosis framework can make SHIMR serve as an indispensable tool in the era of precision medicine that can cater to the demand of both doctors and patients, and reduce the overwhelming financial burden of medical diagnosis.

AB  - One of the critical issues in medical data analysis is accurately predicting a patient's risk of heart disease, which is vital for early intervention and reducing mortality rates. Early detection allows for timely treatment and continuous monitoring by healthcare providers, which is essential but often limited by the inability of medical professionals to provide constant patient supervision. Early detection of cardiac problems and continuous patient monitoring by physicians can help reduce death rates. Doctors cannot constantly have contact with patients, and heart disease detection is not always accurate. By offering a more solid foundation for prediction and decision-making based on data provided by healthcare sectors worldwide, machine learning (ML) could help physicians with the prediction and detection of HD. This study aims to use different feature selection strategies to produce an accurate ML algorithm for early heart disease prediction. We have chosen features using chi-square, ANOVA, and mutual information methods. The three feature groups chosen were SF-1, SF-2, and SF-3. The study employed ten machine learning algorithms to determine the most accurate technique and feature subset fit. The classification algorithms used include support vector machines (SVM), XGBoost, bagging, decision trees (DT), and random forests (RF). We evaluated the proposed heart disease prediction technique using a private dataset, a public dataset, and different cross-validation methods. We used the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to eliminate inconsistent data and discover the machine learning algorithm that achieves the most accurate heart disease predictions. Healthcare providers might identify early-stage heart disease quickly and cheaply with the proposed method. We have used the most effective ML algorithm to create a mobile app that instantly predicts heart disease based on the input symptoms. The experimental results demonstrated that the XGBoost algorithm performed optimally when applied to the combined datasets and the SF-2 feature subset. It had 97.57% accuracy, 96.61% sensitivity, 90.48% specificity, 95.00% precision, a 92.68% F1 score, and a 98% AUC. We have developed an explainable AI method based on SHAP approaches to understand how the system makes its final predictions.

AB  - Machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI/ML) models in healthcare may exacerbate health biases. Regulatory oversight is critical in evaluating the safety and effectiveness of AI/ML devices in clinical settings. We conducted a scoping review on the 692 FDA-approved AI/ML-enabled medical devices approved from 1995-2023 to examine transparency, safety reporting, and sociodemographic representation. Only 3.6% of approvals reported race/ethnicity, 99.1% provided no socioeconomic data. 81.6% did not report the age of study subjects. Only 46.1% provided comprehensive detailed results of performance studies; only 1.9% included a link to a scientific publication with safety and efficacy data. Only 9.0% contained a prospective study for post-market surveillance. Despite the growing number of market-approved medical devices, our data shows that FDA reporting data remains inconsistent. Demographic and socioeconomic characteristics are underreported, exacerbating the risk of algorithmic bias and health disparity.

TI  - Counterfactual Explanation Analytics: Empowering Lay Users to Take Action Against Consequential Automated Decisions
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE VLDB ENDOWMENT
LA  - English
AB  - Machine learning is routinely used to automate consequential decisions about users in domains such as finance and healthcare, raising concerns of transparency and recourse for negative outcomes. Existing Explainable AI techniques generate a static counterfactual point explanation which recommends changes to a user's instance to obtain a positive outcome. Unfortunately, these recommendations are often difficult or impossible for users to realistically enact. To overcome this, we present FACET, the first interactive robust explanation system which generates personalized counterfactual region explanations. FACET's expressive explanation analytics empower users to explore and compare multiple counterfactual options and develop a personalized actionable plan for obtaining their desired outcome. Visitors to the demonstration will interact with FACET via a new web dashboard for explanations of a loan approval scenario. In doing so, visitors will experience how lay users can easily leverage powerful explanation analytics through visual interactions and displays without the need for a strong technical background.

AB  - Preterm birth remains a leading cause of neonatal complications and highlights the need for early and accurate prediction techniques to improve both fetal and maternal health outcomes. This study introduces a hybrid approach integrating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with the Hybrid Greylag Goose and Particle Swarm Optimization (GGPSO) algorithm to optimize preterm birth classification using Electrohysterogram signals. The dataset consists of 58 samples of 1000-second-long Electrohysterogram recordings, capturing key physiological features such as contraction patterns, entropy, and statistical variations. Statistical analysis and feature selection methods are applied to identify the most relevant predictors and enhance model interpretability. LSTM networks effectively capture temporal patterns in uterine activity, while the GGPSO algorithm finetunes hyperparameters, mitigating overfitting and improving classification accuracy. The proposed GGPSO-optimized LSTM model achieved superior performance with 97.34% accuracy, 96.91% sensitivity, 97.74% specificity, and 97.23% F-score, significantly outperforming traditional machine learning approaches and demonstrating the effectiveness of hybrid metaheuristic optimization in enhancing deep learning models for clinical applications. By combining deep learning with metaheuristic optimization, this study contributes to advancing intelligent auto-diagnosis systems, facilitating early detection of preterm birth risks and timely medical interventions.

AB  - Background:The increasing aging population and limited health care resources have placed new demands on the healthcare sector. Reducing the number of hospitalizations has become a political priority in many countries, and special focus has been directed at potentially preventable hospitalizations. Objectives:We aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) prediction model for potentially preventable hospitalizations in the coming year, and to apply explainable AI to identify predictors of hospitalization and their interaction. Methods:We used the Danish CROSS-TRACKS cohort and included citizens in 2016-2017. We predicted potentially preventable hospitalizations within the following year using the citizens' sociodemographic characteristics, clinical characteristics, and health care utilization as predictors. Extreme gradient boosting was used to predict potentially preventable hospitalizations with Shapley additive explanations values serving to explain the impact of each predictor. We reported the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, the area under the precision-recall curve, and 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on five-fold cross-validation. Results:The best performing prediction model showed an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.789 (CI: 0.782-0.795) and an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.232 (CI: 0.219-0.246). The predictors with the highest impact on the prediction model were age, prescription drugs for obstructive airway diseases, antibiotics, and use of municipality services. We found an interaction between age and use of municipality services, suggesting that citizens aged 75+ years receiving municipality services had a lower risk of potentially preventable hospitalization. Conclusion:AI is suitable for predicting potentially preventable hospitalizations. The municipality-based health services seem to have a preventive effect on potentially preventable hospitalizations.

AB  - A scoring system is a simple decision model that checks a set of features, adds a certain number of points to a total score for each feature that is satisfied, and finally makes a decision by comparing the total score to a threshold. Scoring systems have a long history of active use in safety-critical domains such as healthcare and justice, where they provide guidance for making objective and accurate decisions. Given their genuine interpretability, the idea of learning scoring systems from data is obviously appealing from the perspective of explainable AI. In this paper, we propose a practically motivated extension of scoring systems called probabilistic scoring lists (PSL), as well as a method for learning PSLs from data. Instead of making a deterministic decision, a PSL represents uncertainty in the form of probability distributions, or, more generally, probability intervals. Moreover, in the spirit of decision lists, a PSL evaluates features one by one and stops as soon as a decision can be made with enough confidence. To evaluate our approach, we conduct case studies in the medical domain and on standard benchmark data.

AB  - Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score, a reporting system of prostate MRI cases, has become a standard prostate cancer (PCa) screening method due to exceptional diagnosis performance. However, PI-RADS 3 lesions are an unmet medical need because PI-RADS provides diagnosis accuracy of only 30-40% at most, accompanied by a high false-positive rate. Here, we propose an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) based PCa screening system integrating a highly sensitive dual-gate field-effect transistor (DGFET) based multi- marker biosensor for ambiguous lesions identification. This system produces interpretable results by analyzing sensing patterns of three urinary exosomal biomarkers, providing a possibility of an evidence-based prediction from clinicians. In our results, XAI-based PCa screening system showed a high accuracy with an AUC of 0.93 using 102 blinded samples with the non-invasive method. Remarkably, the PCa diagnosis accuracy of patients with PI-RADS 3 was more than twice that of conventional PI-RADS scoring. Our system also provided a reasonable explanation of its decision that TMEM256 biomarker is the leading factor for screening those with PIRADS 3. Our study implies that XAI can facilitate informed decisions, guided by insights into the significance of visualized multi-biomarkers and clinical factors. The XAI-based sensor system can assist healthcare professionals in providing practical and evidence-based PCa diagnoses.

AB  - Background: Asthma is a well-known otolaryngological and immunological disorder that affects patients worldwide. Currently, the primary diagnosis relies on a combination of clinical history, physical examination findings consistent with asthma, and objective evidence of reversible airflow obstruction. However, the diagnostic process can be invasive and time-consuming, which limits clinical efficiency and accessibility. Objectives: In this study, an AI-based prediction system was developed, leveraging voice changes caused by respiratory contraction due to asthma to create a machine learning (ML)-based clinical decision support system. Methods: A total of 1500 speech samples-comprising high-pitch, normal-pitch, and low-pitch recitations of the phonemes [i, a, u]-were used. Long-Term Average Spectrum (LTAS) and Single-Frequency Filtering Cepstral Coefficients (SFCCs) were extracted as features for classification. Seven machine learning algorithms were employed to assess the feasibility of asthma prediction. Results: The Decision Tree, CNN, and LSTM models achieved average accuracies above 0.8, with results of 0.88, 0.80, and 0.84, respectively. Observational results indicate that the Decision Tree model performed best for high-pitch phonemes, whereas the LSTM model outperformed others in normal-pitch and low-pitch phonemes. Additionally, to validate model efficiency and enhance interpretability, feature importance analysis and overall average spectral analysis were applied. Conclusions: This study aims to provide medical clinicians with accurate and reliable decision-making support, improving the efficiency of asthma diagnosis through AI-driven acoustic analysis.

AB  - BackgroundArtificial intelligence integration into healthcare has gained significant attention in recent years, with its use ranging from disease diagnosis to surgical assistance. While artificial intelligence's potential to improve patient outcomes and optimise patient care is undeniable, concerns regarding privacy, transparency, and the potential for medical errors persist. To take full advantage of artificial intelligence's transformative abilities, understanding patient perceptions and attitudes towards its integration into medicine is crucial for ethical considerations and health outcomes.PurposeThis study aimed to describe patients' perceptions of medical artificial intelligence and its integration into the healthcare system, drawing attention to a crucial yet understudied aspect of artificial intelligence adoption in Kazakhstan.DesignDescriptive qualitative design.MethodFrom February to March 2024, the researchers conducted semi-structured interviews amongst 13 patients. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, translated, and then analysed using a thematic analysis approach. The study adhered to the COREQ guidelines.ResultFive themes emerged from 13 interviews: the benefits of artificial intelligence on patient care, the importance of human factors on patient care over artificial intelligence, revolutionising patient care delivery through artificial intelligence, patient education and artificial intelligence, and balancing technology and human interaction in artificial intelligence-driven intervention.ConclusionPatient perceptions of artificial intelligence integration into healthcare were primarily positive. Nevertheless, patients prefer artificial intelligence as a supplementary tool under human supervision due to risks such as possible medical errors and violations of patient privacy.Patient or Public ContributionPatients provided the data for this study. The researchers interviewed them about their perceptions of medical artificial intelligence and its integration into the healthcare system. The patients or the public contributed nothing to the other aspects of the study.

AB  - Background While artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing diagnostic accuracy and streamlining workflows, key ethical questions remain insufficiently explored-particularly around accountability, transparency, and bias. These challenges become especially critical in domains such as pathology and blood sciences, where opaque AI algorithms and non-representative datasets can impact clinical outcomes. The present work focuses on a single NHS context and does not claim broader generalization.Methods We conducted a local qualitative study across multiple healthcare facilities in a single NHS Trust in the West Midlands, United Kingdom, to investigate healthcare professionals' experiences and perceptions of AI-assisted decision-making. Forty participants-including clinicians, healthcare administrators, and AI developers-took part in semi-structured interviews or focus groups. Transcribed data were analyzed using Braun and Clarke's thematic analysis framework, allowing us to identify core themes relating to the benefits of AI, ethical challenges, and potential mitigation strategies.Results Participants reported notable gains in diagnostic efficiency and resource allocation, underscoring AI's potential to reduce turnaround times for routine tests and enhance detection of abnormalities. Nevertheless, accountability surfaced as a pervasive concern: while clinicians felt ultimately liable for patient outcomes, they also relied on AI-generated insights, prompting questions about liability if systems malfunctioned. Transparency emerged as another major theme, with clinicians emphasizing the difficulty of trusting "black box" models that lack clear rationale or interpretability-particularly for rare or complex cases. Bias was repeatedly cited, especially when algorithms underperformed in minority patient groups or in identifying atypical presentations. These issues raised doubts about the fairness and reliability of AIassisted diagnoses.Conclusions Although AI demonstrates promise for improving efficiency and patient care, unresolved ethical complexities around accountability, transparency, and bias may erode stakeholder confidence and compromise patient safety. Participants called for clearer regulatory frameworks, inclusive training datasets, and stronger clinician- developer collaboration. Future research should incorporate patient perspectives, investigate long-term impacts of AI-driven clinical decisions, and refine ethical guidelines to ensure equitable, responsible AI deployment.

AB  - BackgroundPrecision medicine and artificial intelligence (AI) are increasingly integrated into colorectal cancer (CRC) care, offering personalised treatment strategies and data-driven decision support. While these technologies promise improved outcomes, they also raise challenges concerning clinical decision-making, the doctor-patient relationship, and ethics. This study explores physicians' perspectives on integrating precision medicine and AI in CRC care.MethodsA qualitative study was conducted using semi-structured interviews with ten CRC physicians from six European countries. Participants were recruited through purposive and snowball sampling. Interviews were analysed using thematic analysis.ResultsThree key themes emerged from the analysis. First, physicians described precision medicine as a logical extension of existing tailoring practices, offering new opportunities while introducing complexity. Many expressed concerns about the blurred boundary between experimental and standard treatments, noting potential implications for equity and ethical decision-making. Second, AI was viewed as a future partner in care, with the potential to enhance efficiency and assist in synthesising complex data. However, participants voiced concerns about trust, clinical responsibility, and the lack of regulatory clarity, particularly due to AI's "black box" nature. Finally, doctors reported challenges in communicating both precision medicine and AI-based recommendations to patients. They emphasised the importance of adapting communication strategies to individual patients and highlighted the need for structured approaches to ensure patient understanding and prevent miscommunication, especially when dealing with uncertain outcomes or emerging technologies.ConclusionsThe findings highlight both the opportunities and challenges of integrating precision medicine and AI in CRC care. Addressing concerns related to communication, ethics, and regulation requires clear guidance and improved support for clinicians. Precision medicine and AI enhance CRC care but demand robust communication, regulation, and ethical safeguards to ensure transparency, trust, and physician autonomy.

AB  - Gait analysis is a valuable tool for aiding in the diagnosis of neurological diseases, providing objective measurements of human gait kinematics and kinetics. These data enable the quantitative estimation of movement abnormalities, which helps to diagnose disorders and assess their severity. In this regard, machine learning techniques and explainability methods offer an opportunity to enhance anomaly detection in gait measurements and support a more objective assessment of neurodegenerative disease, providing insights into the most relevant gait parameters used for disease identification. This study employs several classifiers and explainability methods to analyze gait data from a public dataset composed of patients affected by degenerative neurological diseases and healthy controls. The work investigates the relevance of spatial, temporal, and kinematic gait parameters in distinguishing such diseases. The findings are consistent among the classifiers employed and in agreement with known clinical findings about the major gait impairments for each disease. This work promotes the use of data-driven assessments in clinical settings, helping reduce subjectivity in gait evaluation and enabling broader deployment in healthcare environments.

AB  - Background There is increasing interest in incorporating clinical decision support (CDS) into electronic healthcare records (EHR). Successful implementation of CDS systems depends on acceptance of them by healthcare workers. We used a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods starting from Qsort methodology to explore expectations and perceptions of practicing physicians on the use of CDS incorporated in EHR. Methods The study was performed in a large tertiary care academic hospital. We used a mixed approach with a Q-sort based classification of pre-defined reactions to clinical case vignettes combined with a thinking-aloud approach, taking into account COREQ recommendations The open source software of Ken-Q Analysis version 1.0.6. was used for the quantitative analysis, using principal components and a Varimax rotation. For the qualitative analysis, a thematic analysis based on the four main themes was performed based on the audiotapes and field notes. Results Thirty physicians were interviewed (7 in training, 8 junior staff and 15 senior staff; 16 females). Nearly all respondents were strongly averse towards interruptive messages, especially when these also were obstructive. Obstructive interruption was considered to be acceptable only when it increases safety, is adjustable to user expertise level and/or allows deviations when the end-user explains why a deviation is desirable in the case at issue. Transparency was deemed an essential feature, which seems to boil down to providing sufficient clarification on the factors underlying the recommendations of the CDS, so that these can be compared against the physicians' existing knowledge, beliefs and convictions. Conclusion Avoidance of disruptive workflows and transparency of the underlying decision processes are important points to consider when developing CDS systems incorporated in EHR.

AB  - Model interpretability is essential in machine learning, particularly for applications in critical fields like healthcare, where understanding model decisions is paramount. While SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) has proven to be a robust tool for explaining machine learning predictions, its high computational cost limits its practicality for real-time use. To address this, we introduce C-SHAP (Clustering-Boosted SHAP), a hybrid method that combines SHAP with K-means clustering to reduce execution times significantly while preserving interpretability. C-SHAP excels across various datasets and machine learning methods, matching SHAP's accuracy in selected features while maintaining an accuracy of 0.73 for Random Forest with substantially faster performance. Notably, in the Diabetes dataset collected by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, C-SHAP reduces the execution time from nearly 2000 s to just 0.21 s, underscoring its potential for scalable, efficient interpretability in time-sensitive applications. Such advancements in interpretability and efficiency may hold value for enhancing decision-making within software-intensive systems, aligning with evolving engineering approaches.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In view of the im-portant role of risk prediction models in the clin-ical diagnosis and treatment of sepsis, and the limitations of existing models in terms of timeli-ness and interpretability, we intend to develop a real-time prediction model of sepsis with high timeliness and clinical interpretability.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used eight real-time basic physiological monitoring indica-tors of patients, including heart rate, respirato-ry rate, oxygen saturation, mean arterial pres-sure, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, temperature and blood glucose, ex-tracted three-hour dynamic feature sequences, and calculated 3 linear parameters (mean, stan-dard deviation, and endpoint value), a 24 -dimen-sional feature vector was constructed, and final-ly a real-time sepsis prediction model was con-structed based on the Local Interpretable Mod-el-Agnostic Explanation (LIME) interpretability method.RESULTS: The area under the receiver oper-ating characteristic curve (AUROC), Accuracy and F1 scores of Extremely Randomized Trees we built were higher than those of other models, with AUROC above 0.76, showing the best per-formance. The Imbalance XGBoost has a high specificity (0.86) in predicting sepsis. The LIME local interpretable model we built can display a large amount of valid model prediction details for clinical workers' reference, including the pre-diction probability and the influence of each fea-ture on the prediction result, thus effectively as-sisting the work of clinical workers and improv-ing diagnostic efficiency.CONCLUSIONS: This model can provide a re-al-time dynamic early warning of sepsis for crit-ically ill patients under supervision and provide reference for clinical decision support. At the same time, interpretive analysis of sepsis pre-diction models can improve the credibility of the models.

AB  - In recent years, the prevalence of chronic diseases such as Ulcerative Colitis (UC) has increased, bringing a heavy burden to healthcare systems. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) stands out for its cost-effective and efficient treatment modalities, providing unique advantages in healthcare. But syndrome differentiation of UC presents a longstanding challenge in TCM due to its chronic nature and varied manifestations. While existing research has primarily explored machine learning applications for diagnosis and prognosis prediction, the critical issue of explainability in syndrome differentiation remains underexamined. To bridge this gap, we propose an ensemble prediction model enhanced with SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to improve interpretability and clinical utility. Our study utilizes a dataset of 8078 electronic medical records from Dongfang Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, collected between 2006 and 2019. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our ensemble models outperform individual deep learning approaches, with the Gradient Boosting (GB) model achieving 83% F1 in syndrome differentiation. Furthermore, SHAP and LIME reveal key features associated with different syndromes, such as frequent stool in spleen-kidney yang deficiency and lower abdominal coldness in spleen yang deficiency, offering valuable insights for intelligent syndrome differentiation. These findings hold significant promise for advancing TCM-based UC management, enhancing clinical decision-making, and improving patient outcomes.

AB  - Objectives: We evaluated methods for preparing electronic health record data to reduce bias before applying artificial intelligence (AI). Methods: We created methods for transforming raw data into a data framework for applying machine learning and natural language processing techniques for predicting falls and fractures. Strategies such as inclusion and reporting for multiple races, mixed data sources such as outpatient, inpatient, structured codes, and unstructured notes, and addressing missingness were applied to raw data to promote a reduction in bias. The raw data was carefully curated using validated definitions to create data variables such as age, race, gender, and healthcare utilization. For the formation of these variables, clinical, statistical, and data expertise were used. The research team included a variety of experts with diverse professional and demographic backgrounds to include diverse perspectives. Results: For the prediction of falls, information extracted from radiology reports was converted to a matrix for applying machine learning. The processing of the data resulted in an input of 5,377,673 reports to the machine learning algorithm, out of which 45,304 were flagged as positive and 5,332,369 as negative for falls. Processed data resulted in lower missingness and a better representation of race and diagnosis codes. For fractures, specialized algorithms extracted snippets of text around keywork "femoral" from dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans to identify femoral neck T-scores that are important for predicting fracture risk. The natural language processing algorithms yielded 98% accuracy and 2% error rate The methods to prepare data for input to artificial intelligence processes are reproducible and can be applied to other studies. Conclusion: The life cycle of data from raw to analytic form includes data governance, cleaning, management, and analysis. When applying artificial intelligence methods, input data must be prepared optimally to reduce algorithmic bias, as biased output is harmful. Building AI-ready data frameworks that improve efficiency can contribute to transparency and reproducibility.

AB  - Artificial intelligence is increasingly being used in pharmacovigilance. However, the use of artificial intelligence in pharmacovigilance raises ethical concerns related to fairness, non-discrimination, compliance, and responsibility as the central ethical principles in risk assessment and regulatory requirements. This paper explores these concerns and provides a roadmap to how to address these challenges by considering data collection, privacy protection, transparency and accountability, model training, and explainability in artificial intelligence decision making for drug safety surveillance. A number of responsible approaches have been identified including an ethics framework and best practices to enhance artificial intelligence use in healthcare. The document also recognizes some initiatives that have demonstrated the importance of ethics in artificial intelligence pharmacovigilance. Nevertheless, the major needs mentioned in this paper are transparency, accountability, data protection, and fairness, which stress the necessity of collaboration to construct a cognitive framework aimed at integrating ethical artificial intelligence into pharmacovigilance. In conclusion, innovation should be balanced with ethical responsibility to enhance public health outcomes as well as patient safety.

AB  - Objective: Implementation of machine learning (ML) may be limited by patients' right to "meaningful information about the logic involved" when ML influences healthcare decisions. Given the complexity of healthcare decisions, it is likely that ML outputs will need to be understood and trusted by physicians, and then explained to patients. We therefore investigated the association between physician understanding of ML outputs, their ability to explain these to patients, and their willingness to trust the ML outputs, using various ML explainability methods.
   Materials and Methods: We designed a survey for physicians with a diagnostic dilemma that could be resolved by an ML risk calculator. Physicians were asked to rate their understanding, explainability, and trust in response to 3 different ML outputs. One ML output had no explanation of its logic (the control) and 2 ML outputs used different model-agnostic explainability methods. The relationships among understanding, explainability, and trust were assessed using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests of association.
   Results: The survey was sent to 1315 physicians, and 170 (13%) provided completed surveys. There were significant associations between physician understanding and explainability (P<.001), between physician understanding and trust (P<.001), and between explainability and trust (P<.001). ML outputs that used modelagnostic explainability methods were preferred by 88% of physicians when compared with the control condition; however, no particular ML explainability method had a greater influence on intended physician behavior.
   Conclusions: Physician understanding, explainability, and trust in ML risk calculators are related. Physicians preferred ML outputs accompanied by model-agnostic explanations but the explainability method did not alter intended physician behavior.

AB  - Purpose of reviewThis review explores the use of brain age estimation from MRI scans as a biomarker of brain health. With disorders like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's increasing globally, there is an urgent need for early detection tools that can identify at-risk individuals before cognitive symptoms emerge. Brain age offers a noninvasive, quantitative measure of neurobiological ageing, with applications in early diagnosis, disease monitoring, and personalized medicine.Recent findingsStudies show that individuals with Alzheimer's, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Parkinson's have older brain ages than their chronological age. Longitudinal research indicates that brain-predicted age difference (brain-PAD) rises with disease progression and often precedes cognitive decline. Advances in deep learning and multimodal imaging have improved the accuracy and interpretability of brain age predictions. Moreover, socioeconomic disparities and environmental factors significantly affect brain aging, highlighting the need for inclusive models.SummaryBrain age estimation is a promising biomarker for identify future risk of neurodegenerative disease, monitoring progression, and helping prognosis. Challenges like implementation of standardization, demographic biases, and interpretability remain. Future research should integrate brain age with biomarkers and multimodal imaging to enhance early diagnosis and intervention strategies.

AB  - PurposeAdvances in the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) have allowed patients to reach adulthood. The forced oscillation technique (FOT) is a new method for providing an exam that is simple to perform and simultaneously provides a detailed respiratory system evaluation. The purpose of this study was to use machine learning (ML) algorithms to increase the accuracy and interpretability of FOT parameters in the investigation and diagnosis of respiratory changes in adults with CF.MethodsThe database was created based on 150 measurements in 50 volunteers (23 in the control group and 27 in the test group). The following supervised ML algorithms were selected for the tests: K-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest (RF), AdaBoost with decision trees (ADAB), and light gradient boosting (LGB). These data were also subjected to a Bayesian network synthesized by a genetic algorithm (BNGA) in an attempt to maintain good accuracy and increase the interpretability of the results. A soft vote ensemble strategy was employed to enhance the diagnostic accuracy.ResultsThe first part of this study showed the best FOT parameter: the reactance X-m (AUC = 0.85), indicating moderate accuracy. In the second part, the original FOT parameters were used as input in the chosen algorithms. BNGA had the best performance alone (AUC = 0.88), while the soft voting ensemble achieved AUC = 0.90. When cross-product and feature selection methods were applied, the RF and BNGA were the algorithms with the best results (AUC = 0.88), and the soft voting ensemble achieved an AUC = 0.94.ConclusionThis study provides high diagnostic accuracy with improved interpretability of the FOT parameters, which assists doctors in the medical diagnosis of respiratory changes in CF.

AB  - Within the healthcare sector, deploying Machine Learning (ML) models involves trial-and-error approaches, considerable time to create task-specific models, and collaboration between ML experts and physicians. To overcome these hurdles, Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) appears as a promising resource towards the advancement of precision and personalised medicine. Despite being a hot topic, AutoML remains relatively underexplored in the realm of medical imaging. To address this gap, the research objectives are to enrich the body of knowledge by comprehensively exploring the AutoML solutions, evaluating and comparing their performance, and even verifying their compliance to Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) principles. Furthermore, we provide a unified solution with open-source AutoML solutions, as they seek to democratize access for less experienced users. Thus, this research paper contains a methodology to identify and evaluate 5 solutions, Fastai, Ktrain, Ludwig, Autogluon, and Autokeras, across 3 relevant medical imaging datasets. Their evaluation involved binary classifications using chest X-rays and breast histopathological images, and a multi-class scenario with brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images. Results reveal that both Ktrain and Fastai consistently demonstrate lower F1-Score values, regardless of the dataset. This stems from their limited level of automation, as the user is required to introduce the type of architecture and fine-tune certain hyperparameters. In contrast, Ludwig when employing the EfficientNet architecture, it roughly takes 10 minutes to achieve an F1-Score of 98.06 +/- 0.86% with the chest X-ray dataset. About 17 minutes to acquire 98.16 +/- 0.50% with the histopathological dataset, and nearly 7 minutes to reach an F1-Score of 96.52 +/- 1.07% with the brain MRI dataset. In this dataset is where Autokeras and Autogluon failed to provide suitable metrics for a typical multi-class problem. Nonetheless, in both binary scenarios, they achieve state-of-art results. Although having a higher execution time than Ludwig, they have a more robust search space. Finally, our findings highlight the need to incorporate XAI principles to improve the user's experience, particularly for non-ML practitioners.

AB  - Healthcare insurance fraud imposes a significant financial burden on healthcare systems worldwide, with annual losses reaching billions of dollars. This study aims to improve fraud detection accuracy using machine learning techniques. Our approach consists of three key stages: data preprocessing, model training and integration, and result analysis with feature interpretation. Initially, we examined the dataset's characteristics and employed embedded and permutation methods to test the performance and runtime of single models under different feature sets, selecting the minimal number of features that could still achieve high performance. We then applied ensemble techniques, including Voting, Weighted, and Stacking methods, to combine different models and compare their performances. Feature interpretation was achieved through partial dependence plots (PDP), SHAP, and LIME, allowing us to understand each feature's impact on the predictions. Finally, we benchmarked our approach against existing studies to evaluate its advantages and limitations. The findings demonstrate improved fraud detection accuracy and offer insights into the interpretability of machine learning models in this context.

AB  - Objective To develop and validate a real-world evidence-driven early warning system for the risk-stratified prediction of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated hepatic dysfunction in hospitalized patients, leveraging interpretable machine learning models to provide clinically actionable decision support for timely intervention.Methods A retrospective single-center cohort study was conducted utilizing high-resolution electronic health records (EHRs) from 983 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Clinical features (e.g., laboratory results, medication exposures, and disease progression markers) were systematically analyzed. To mitigate class imbalance, we employed the Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique (SMOTE) prior to model development. Thirteen distinct machine learning (ML) algorithms were trained and benchmarked to construct an optimal risk stratification framework. Model performance was rigorously evaluated using metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis was employed to enhance clinical interpretability and provide transparent insights for decision-making.Results The SMOTE-edited nearest neighbors (ENN) technique (SMOTE-ENN) resampling strategy, combined with random forest (RF) and extra trees (ET) models, demonstrated superior predictive performance, achieving AUC values of 0.998 +/- 0.002 (RF) and 0.997 +/- 0.002 (ET), respectively. The SHAP-based interpretability analysis identified glutathione administration and hepatic enzymes (e.g., gamma-glutamyltransferase [GGT] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) as the most influential predictors. The online prediction platforms were developed for liver injury early warning risk stratification (low- and high-risk) based on predicted probabilities classification.Conclusion This research successfully established a machine learning-powered early warning system capable of real-time risk stratification for COVID-19-associated liver injury through dynamic integration of clinical data. The ensemble RF/ET-based models demonstrated significant clinical utility as decision support tools, particularly through their ability to identify high-risk patients requiring intensified monitoring and optimize hepatoprotective. By emphasizing drug-induced injury markers and disease progression process, ML models establish a personalized monitoring framework that could potentially transform clinical management for target patients.

AB  - The journey to the next decade of smart cellular connectivity, sixth-generation (6G) networks, has already begun, even though 6G is still in its nascent stages and far from its deployment. In telecommunications, 6G networks have gained the attention of the industry and academia. 6G is planned to succeed the 5G standard with almost 100 times greater speed. One of the exciting features of 6G is Edge Intelligence (EI), which is the coupling of Edge Computing with Artificial Intelligence (AI). So far, EI has yet to be a component of the existing and predecessor communication standards; thus, 6G will open up many opportunities with its deployment in the future. Nonetheless, integration of 6G with EI, in other words, Edge and AI, is also susceptible to various challenges, particularly security and privacy. Therefore, this article proposes a trusted AI-enabled intelligent architecture for the 6G-envisioned Edge Computing platform. The proposed architecture is based on the Explainable AI concept and is mainly used to ensure the security and privacy of the future 6G networks at the Edge. Following this, the work presents a detailed case study of employing the proposed framework. The preliminary discussion indicates some exciting findings and lays the foundation for future research. In a nutshell, the proposed architecture can be extended to different verticals, including, but not limited to, life-critical systems, like e-healthcare, autonomous vehicles, and traffic monitoring.

AB  - BackgroundData mining of electronic health records (EHRs) has a huge potential for improving clinical decision support and to help healthcare deliver precision medicine. Unfortunately, the rule-based and machine learning-based approaches used for natural language processing (NLP) in healthcare today all struggle with various shortcomings related to performance, efficiency, or transparency.MethodsIn this paper, we address these issues by presenting a novel method for NLP that implements unsupervised learning of word embeddings, semi-supervised learning for simplified and accelerated clinical vocabulary and concept building, and deterministic rules for fine-grained control of information extraction. The clinical language is automatically learnt, and vocabulary, concepts, and rules supporting a variety of NLP downstream tasks can further be built with only minimal manual feature engineering and tagging required from clinical experts. Together, these steps create an open processing pipeline that gradually refines the data in a transparent way, which greatly improves the interpretable nature of our method. Data transformations are thus made transparent and predictions interpretable, which is imperative for healthcare. The combined method also has other advantages, like potentially being language independent, demanding few domain resources for maintenance, and able to cover misspellings, abbreviations, and acronyms. To test and evaluate the combined method, we have developed a clinical decision support system (CDSS) named Information System for Clinical Concept Searching (ICCS) that implements the method for clinical concept tagging, extraction, and classification.ResultsIn empirical studies the method shows high performance (recall 92.6%, precision 88.8%, F-measure 90.7%), and has demonstrated its value to clinical practice. Here we employ a real-life EHR-derived dataset to evaluate the method's performance on the task of classification (i.e., detecting patient allergies) against a range of common supervised learning algorithms. The combined method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to the alternative methods we evaluate. We also perform a qualitative analysis of common word embedding methods on the task of word similarity to examine their potential for supporting automatic feature engineering for clinical NLP tasks.ConclusionsBased on the promising results, we suggest more research should be aimed at exploiting the inherent synergies between unsupervised, supervised, and rule-based paradigms for clinical NLP.

AB  - Stress recognition, particularly using machine learning (ML) with physiological data such as heart rate variability (HRV), holds promise for mental health interventions. However, limited datasets in affective computing and healthcare research can lead to inaccurate conclusions regarding the ML model performance. This study employed supervised learning algorithms to classify stress and relaxation states using HRV measures. To account for limitations associated with small datasets, robust strategies were implemented based on methodological recommendations for ML with a limited dataset, including data segmentation, feature selection, and model evaluation. Our findings highlight that the random forest model achieved the best performance in distinguishing stress from non-stress states. Notably, it showed higher performance in identifying stress from relaxation (F1-score: 86.3%) compared to neutral states (F1-score: 65.8%). Additionally, the model demonstrated generalizability when tested on independent secondary datasets, showcasing its ability to distinguish between stress and relaxation states. While our performance metrics might be lower than some previous studies, this likely reflects our focus on robust methodologies to enhance the generalizability and interpretability of ML models, which are crucial for real-world applications with limited datasets.

AB  - Artificial intelligence has been applied to medical diagnosis and decision-making but it has not been used for classification of Class III malocclusions in children. Objective: This study aims to propose an innovative machine learning (ML)-based diagnostic model for automatically classifies dental, skeletal and functional Class III malocclusions. Methods: The collected data related to 46 cephalometric feature measurements from 4-14-year-old children (n = 666). The data set was divided into a training set and a test set in a 7:3 ratio. Initially, we employed the Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) algorithm to filter the 46 input parameters, selecting 14 significant features. Subsequently, we constructed 10 ML models and trained these models using the 14 significant features from the training set through ten-fold cross-validation, and evaluated the models' average accuracy in test set. Finally, we conducted an interpretability analysis of the optimal model using the ML model interpretability tool SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Results: The top five models ranked by their area under the curve (AUC) values were: GPR (0.879), RBF SVM (0.876), QDA (0.876), Linear SVM (0.875) and L2 logistic (0.869). The DeLong test showed no statistical difference between GPR and the other models (p > 0.05). Therefore GPR was selected as the optimal model. The SHAP feature importance plot revealed that he top five features were SN-GoMe (the ratio of the length of the anterior skull base SN to that of the mandibular base GoMe), U1-NA (maxillary incisor angulation to NA plane), Overjet (the distance between two lines perpendicular to the functional occlusal plane from U1 and L), ANB (the difference between angles SNA and SNB), and AB-NPo (the angle between the AB and N-Pog line). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that ML models based on cephalometric data could effectively assist dentists to classify dental, functional and skeletal Class III malocclusions in children. In addition, features such as SN_GoMe, U1_NA and Overjet can as important indicators for predicting the severity of Class III malocclusions.

AB  - Introduction: The rapid integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into healthcare presents significant governance challenges, requiring balanced approaches that safeguard safety, efficacy, equity, and trust (SEET). This study proposes a cognitive framework to guide AI governance, addressing tradeoffs between speed, scope, and capability. Objective: To develop a structured governance model that harmonizes stakeholder perspectives, focusing on multi-dimensional challenges and ethical principles essential for AI in healthcare. Methods: A multidisciplinary team convened at the Blueprints for Trust conference, organized by the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA), and the Division of Clinical Informatics at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Following extensive discussions with 190 participants across sectors, three governance models were identified to address specific domains: (1) Clinical Decision Support (CDS), (2) Real-World Evidence (RWE), (3) Consumer Health (CH). Results: Three governance models emerged, tailored to CDS, RWE, and CH domains. Key recommendations include establishing a Health AI Consumer Consortium for patient-centered oversight, initiating voluntary accreditation and certification frameworks, and piloting risk-level-based standards. These models balance rapid adaptation with SEET-focused safeguards through transparency, inclusivity, and ongoing learning. Conclusion: A proactive, constraint-based governance framework is critical for responsible AI integration in healthcare. This structured, multi-stakeholder approach provides a roadmap for ethical, transparent governance that can evolve with technological advancements, enhancing trust and safety in healthcare AI applications.

AB  - BackgroundCoughing sounds contain various bio-metric information with regards to respiratory diseases that can help in the assessment of respiratory diseases. While clinicians find coughs insightful, non-experts struggle to identify abnormalities in cough sounds. Furthermore, respiratory diseases has characterized by widespread health complications and elevated mortality rates, the development of early diagnostic systems is imperative for ensuring timely intervention and improving outcomes for both clinicians and patients. Accordingly, we propose a deep learning-based model for early diagnosis. To enhance the reliability of the training data, we utilized annotations provided by multiple medical specialists. Additionally, we examined how clinical expertise and diagnostic input influence the model's generalization performance.MethodsThis study introduces a deep learning framework utilizing VGGish as a transfer learning model, enhanced with additional detection and classification networks. The detection model identifies cough events within recorded audio, and then the classification model determines whether a detected cough is normal or abnormal. Both models were trained on raw cough sound data collected via smartphones and labeled by medical experts through a rigorous inspection process.ResultsExperimental evaluations demonstrated that the cough detection model achieved an average accuracy of 0.9883, while the cough classification model attained accuracies of 0.8417, 0.8629, and 0.8662 among dataset1, 2, and 3. To enhance interpretability, we applied Grad-CAM to visualize the features that influenced the model's decision-making. Model performance was further evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC).ConclusionsOur proposed cough classification model has the potential to assist individuals with limited access to healthcare as well as medical professionals with limited experience in diagnosing cough-related conditions. By leveraging deep learning and smartphone-recorded cough sounds, this approach aims to enhance early detection and management of respiratory diseases.

AB  - This study explored the application of explainable machine learning models to enhance breast cancer diagnosis using serum biomarkers, contrary to many studies that focus on medical images and demographic data. The primary objective was to develop models that are not only accurate but also provide insights into the factors driving predictions, addressing the need for trustworthy AI in healthcare. Several classification models were evaluated, including OneR, JRIP, the FURIA, J48, the ADTree, and the Random Forest, all of which are known for their explainability. The dataset included a variety of biomarkers, such as electrolytes, metal ions, marker proteins, enzymes, lipid profiles, peptide hormones, steroid hormones, and hormone receptors. The Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy at 99.401%, followed closely by JRIP, the FURIA, and the ADTree at 98.802%. OneR and J48 achieved 98.204% accuracy. Notably, the models identified oxytocin as a key predictive biomarker, with most models featuring it in their rules. Other significant parameters included GnRH, beta-endorphin, vasopressin, IRAP, and APB, as well as factors like iron, cholinesterase, the total protein, progesterone, 5-nucleotidase, and the BMI, which are considered clinically relevant to breast cancer pathogenesis. This study discusses the roles of the identified parameters in cancer development, thus underscoring the potential of explainable machine learning models for enhancing early breast cancer diagnosis by focusing on explainability and the use of serum biomarkers.The combination of both can lead to improved early detection and personalized treatments, emphasizing the potential of these methods in clinical settings. The identified markers also provide additional research and therapeutic targets for breast cancer pathogenesis and a deep understanding of their interactions, advancing personalized approaches to breast cancer management.

AB  - Otitis Media (OM), predominantly affecting children, is a significant global health issue, with an estimated 360 million pediatric cases yearly worldwide. OM causes mild and moderate conductive hearing loss which can be disabling for young children, particularly during the first three years of life when brain growth is rapid, resulting in poor speech and language development, poor communication skills, and increased vulnerability on entering school. OM therefore contributes to the global burden of all-cause hearing loss. This systematic review seeks to provide a comprehensive evaluation of pre-trained Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, including both classical Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), in the context of OM. This review proposes six research questions, and it summarizes the body of research across multiple domains, including the diversity and quantity of source material for training and testing models, including otoscopy images, videos, and tympanometry, and the methods used to assess quality and effectiveness in real-time settings. In addition, the review aims to provide insight into the impact and potential of AI in improving OM diagnosis and cast light on the existing challenges, such as model interpretability, limited medical expert involvement, and the need for knowledge discovery and unanswered questions, including the evolving landscape of OM diagnosis within this domain. The findings of this systematic review emphasize the importance of developing more interpretable AI models that incorporate both still images of the tympanic membrane and video recordings (with multiple frames) to maximize sensitivity and specificity of the model. In addition, collaboration with consumers and medical professionals in multiple specialties (general practice, pediatricians, audiologists and ear, nose, throat (ENT) surgeons) is needed to ensure applicability and confidence of these diagnostic digital support systems in real-world healthcare settings.

AB  - BackgroundOvarian cancer (OC) is the most lethal gynecological malignancy, with limited early screening methods and poor prognosis. Artificial intelligence technology has made a great breakthrough in cancer diagnosis. PurposeWe aim to develop a specific interpretable machine learning (ML) prediction model for the diagnosis and prognosis of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) based on a variety of biomarkers. MethodsA total of 521 patients with EOC and 144 patients with benign gynecological diseases were enrolled including derivation datasets and an external validation cohort. The predicted information was acquired by 9 supervised ML methods, through 34 parameters. Behind predicted reasons for the best ML were improved by using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) algorithm. In addition, the prognosis of EOC was analyzed by unsupervised clustering and Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival analysis. ResultsML technology was superior to conventional logistic regression in predicting EOC diagnosis and XGBoost performed best in the external validation datasets. The AUC values of distinguishing EOC and benign disease patients, determining pathological type, grade and clinical stage were 0.958 (0.926-0.989), 0.792 (0.701-0.8834), 0.819 (0.687-0.950) and 0.68 (0.573-0.788) respectively. For negative CA-125 EOC patients, the AUC performance of XGBoost model was 0.835(0.763-0.907). We used unsupervised cluster analysis to identify EOC subgroups with significantly poor overall survival (p-value <0.0001) and recurrence-free survival (p-value <0.0001). ConclusionsBased on the preoperative characteristics, we proved that ML algorithm can provide an acceptable diagnosis and prognosis prediction model for EOC patients. Meanwhile, SHAP analysis can improve the interpretability of ML models and contribute to precision medicine.

AB  - The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven diagnostics and wearable health technologies is transforming health care delivery by enabling real-time health monitoring and early disease detection. These innovations are catalyzing a shift toward personalized medicine, with interventions tailored to individual patient profiles with unprecedented precision. This paper examines the current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) evidence standards framework (ESF) for digital health technologies (DHTs) and evaluates the challenges associated with integrating DHTs into existing health and care systems. A comprehensive review of the NICE ESF guidelines was conducted, alongside an evaluation of their applicability to emerging AI and wearable technologies. Key limitations and barriers were identified, with particular focus on the framework's responsiveness to technologies that evolve through machine learning and real-world data integration. Our findings indicate that while the NICE ESF provides a structured approach for evaluating DHTs, it lacks the adaptability required for rapidly evolving innovations. The framework does not sufficiently incorporate real-world evidence or support continuous learning models, which are critical for the safe and effective deployment of AI-based diagnostics and wearables. To remain effective and relevant, the NICE ESF should transition to a dynamic, adaptive model co-designed with industry stakeholders. By embedding real-world evidence-based strategies and promoting transparency, efficiency, and collaborative innovation, the updated framework would better facilitate the integration of AI-driven diagnostics and wearables into health care systems, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes and optimizing health care delivery.

AB  - The next-generation Internet of Things (NGIoT) is expected to incorporate emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence(AI), edge computing, augmented reality, tactile Internet, digital twin, 5G, and distributed ledgers. These technologies hold the potential to revolutionize a broad spectrum of IoT applications ranging from environmental monitoring to smart healthcare. In particular, these technologies are critical for advanced monitoring, processing, management, and medical service delivery in healthcare-centric IoT networks such as the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), Internet of Nano Things (IoNT), and Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT). Today, AI finds extensive application within decision support systems employed in the realm of IoMT; however, these systems are predominantly results-oriented and lack interpretability, posing concerns for medical professionals, patients, and the wider user community in trusting system decisions. In this paper, we propose an AI and virtual reality-supported audio and visual explainability framework, called MetaXAI, for intrusion detection in IoMT. MetaXAI presents the developed ML model decisions based on the ELI5, SHAP and LIME methods in a simulated 3D environment to the expert and the end user in an audible and visual way. Experimental results show that the MetaXAI framework can perform intrusion detection with a success rate of about 94% and effectively presents its decisions with rich and innovative 3D explanation interfaces.

AB  - Introduction The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into medical text generation is transforming public health by enhancing clinical documentation, patient education, and decision support. However, the widespread deployment of AI in this domain introduces significant ethical challenges, including fairness, privacy protection, and accountability. Traditional AI-driven medical text generation models often inherit biases from training data, resulting in disparities in healthcare communication across different demographic groups. Moreover, ensuring patient data confidentiality while maintaining transparency in AI-generated content remains a critical concern. Existing approaches either lack robust bias mitigation mechanisms or fail to provide interpretable and privacy-preserving outputs, compromising ethical compliance and regulatory adherence.Methods To address these challenges, this paper proposes an innovative framework that combines privacy-preserving AI techniques with interpretable model architectures to achieve ethical compliance in medical text generation. The method employs a hybrid approach that integrates knowledge-based reasoning with deep learning, ensuring both accuracy and transparency. Privacy-enhancing technologies, such as homomorphic encryption and secure multi-party computation, are incorporated to safeguard sensitive medical data throughout the text generation process. Fairness-aware training protocols are introduced to mitigate biases in generated content and enhance trustworthiness.Results and discussion The proposed approach effectively addresses critical challenges of bias, privacy, and interpretability in medical text generation. By combining symbolic reasoning with data-driven learning and embedding ethical principles at the system design level, the framework ensures regulatory alignment and improves public trust. This methodology lays the groundwork for broader deployment of ethically sound AI systems in healthcare communication.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI)-based diagnostic systems provide less error-prone and safer support to clinicians, enhancing the medical decision-making process. This study presents a smart and reliable healthcare framework for detecting Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. Early detection of AD before the onset of clinical symptoms is the most crucial step in starting timely treatment. To predict the conversion of cognitively normal patients to those with AD, three-dimensional 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) whole-brain neuroimaging methods have been extensively studied. However, depending on the 3D volume, this method is computationally expensive. To solve this problem, we used an approximate rank pooling method originally designed for video action recognition with a 3D MRI volume to obtain a compressed representation of multiple two-dimensional (2D) MRI slices. This study proposes a hybrid multimodal CNN-BiLSTM deep model for AD progression detection, in which the resulting dynamic 2D images are fused with cognitive features. Moreover, a novel explainable AI approach is proposed to provide visual explanations using the resulting longitudinal 2D dynamic images. Temporal explanations were provided by visualizing the affected brain regions captured using longitudinal 2D MRIs. By utilizing a sample of 1,692 subjects with multimodal data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset, our method was assessed using a 10-fold cross-validation process. The model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 94% using longitudinal 2D three-time-step dynamic image data. The fusion of 2D dynamic images with cognitive features enhanced the performance by 2% in terms of the AUC. Patients who gradually develop AD, show changes in various brain regions. For such patients, our system highlights the critical role of the hippocampus, medial amygdala, caudal hippocampus, and lateral amygdala at the initial time steps. In the late stages of AD, the system detects abnormalities in extra brain regions such as the medial temporal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, and caudal hippocampus; indicating that patients have completely progressed to AD.

AB  - The current ML approaches do not fully focus to answer a still unresolved and topical challenge, namely the prediction of priorities of COVID-19 vaccine administration. Thus, our task includes some additional methodological challenges mainly related to avoiding unwanted bias while handling categorical and ordinal data with a highly imbalanced nature. Hence, the main contribution of this study is to propose a machine learning algorithm, namely Hierarchical Priority Classification eXtreme Gradient Boosting for priority classification for COVID-19 vaccine administration using the Italian Federation of General Practitioners dataset that contains Electronic Health Record data of 17k patients. We measured the effectiveness of the proposed methodology for classifying all the priority classes while demonstrating a significant improvement with respect to the state of the art. The proposed ML approach, which is integrated into a clinical decision support system, is currently supporting General Pracitioners in assigning COVID-19 vaccine administration priorities to their assistants.

AB  - The combination of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and data science in the Internet of Things (IoT) has enhanced the concept of anomaly detection. It improves system reliability, efficiency, and security in industrial automation, healthcare, smart cities, and cybersecurity sectors. This survey aims to provide an overview of the current developments, issues, and prospects of this growing area of study. This survey also highlights the importance of AI algorithms, particularly Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), in enhancing the capabilities of detection, analysis, and enabling measures in anticipation of future events. In addition, it identifies the major issues considered crucial to the DL application's general framework, such as the data quality problem, model interpretability, and real-time and scalability issues. It provides potential solutions through federated learning, edge computing, and blockchain technologies. This paper explores how various features of 6G, including ultra-low latency, massive connectivity, and energy-efficient communication frameworks, can significantly enhance the capabilities of IoT anomaly detection systems. Although 5G brings impressive data rates and connectivity, 6G is anticipated to introduce a paradigm shift in real-time analytics, distributed intelligence, and scalability, which is vital for efficient IoT anomaly detection. The emphasis of this paper is on the use case of IoT anomaly detection, given the unique capabilities of 6G that were not fully explored in previous communication technologies, such as 4G and 5G, particularly in terms of handling computational complexity. By addressing many of the previously listed challenges, the ultra-low latency, massive connectivity, and energy-efficient communication frameworks that 6G will support will revolutionize anomaly detection and support processes, resulting in more robust and adaptive IoT ecosystems.

AB  - The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has continued to cause severe challenges during this unprecedented time, affecting every part of daily life in terms of health, economics, and social development. There is an increasing demand for chest X-ray (CXR) scans, as pneumonia is the primary and vital complication of COVID-19. CXR is widely used as a screening tool for lung -related diseases due to its simple and relatively inexpensive application. However, these scans require expert radiologists to interpret the results for clinical decisions, i.e., diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. The digitalization of various sectors, including healthcare, has accelerated during the pandemic, with the use and importance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) dramatically increasing. This paper proposes a model using an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) technique to detect and interpret COVID-19 positive CXR images. We further analyze the impact of COVID-19 positive CXR images using heatmaps. The proposed model leverages transfer learning and data augmentation techniques for faster and more adequate model training. Lung segmentation is applied to enhance the model performance further. We conducted a pre-trained network comparison with the highest classification performance (F1-Score: 98%) using the ResNet model.

AB  - Background/Objective: This study explores the use of AI-powered radiomics to classify and monitor brain metastasis progression and regression following Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) based on MRI imaging. A clinical decision support application was developed using Streamlit to provide real-time, AI-driven predictions for treatment monitoring. Methods: MRI scans from 60 patients (3194 images) were analyzed using a transfer learning-enhanced AlexNet deep learning model. Class imbalance was mitigated through dynamic class weighting and data augmentation to ensure equitable performance across all classes. Optimized preprocessing pipelines ensured dataset standardization. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-scores, and AUC, with 95% confidence intervals. Additionally, a comparative analysis of Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) outcomes and predictive modeling demonstrated strong correlations between tumor volume evolution and treatment response. The AI predictions and visualizations were integrated into a Streamlit-based application to ensure clinical usability and ease of access. The AI-driven approach effectively classified progression and regression patterns, reinforcing its potential for clinical integration. Results: The transfer learning model achieved flawless classification accuracy (100%; 95% CI: 100-100%) along with perfect precision, recall, and F1-scores. The AUC score of 1.0000 (95% CI: 1.0000-1.0000) indicated excellent discrimination between progression and regression cases. Compared to the baseline AlexNet model (99.53% accuracy; 95% CI: 98.90-100.00%), the TL-enhanced model resolved all misclassifications. Tumor volume analysis identified the baseline size as a key predictor of progression (Pearson r = 0.795, r = 0.795, r = 0.795, p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, and p < 0.0001). The training time (420.12 s) was faster than ResNet-50 (443.38 s) and EfficientNet-B0 (439.87 s), while achieving equivalent metrics. Despite 100% accuracy, the model requires multi-center validation for generalizability. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that transfer learning with dynamic class weighting provides a highly accurate and reliable framework for monitoring brain metastases post-GKRS. The Streamlit-based AI application enhances clinical decision-making by improving diagnostic precision and reducing variability. Explainable AI techniques, such as Grad-CAM visualizations, improve interpretability and support clinical adoption. These findings emphasize the transformative potential of AI in personalized treatment strategies, extending applications to genomic profiling, survival modeling, and longitudinal follow-ups for brain metastasis management.

AB  - Machine learning methods enable medical systems to automatically generate data-driven decision support models using real-world data inputs, eliminating the need for explicit rule design. In this research, we investigated the application of machine learning methods in healthcare, specifically focusing on pregnancy and childbirth risks. The timely identification of risk factors during early pregnancy, along with risk management, mitigation, prevention, and adherence management, can significantly reduce adverse perinatal outcomes and complications for both mother and child. Given the existing burden on medical professionals, clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) can play a role in risk management. However, these systems require high-quality decision support models based on validated medical data that are also clinically interpretable. To develop models for predicting childbirth risks and due dates, we conducted a retrospective analysis of electronic health records from the perinatal Center of the Almazov Specialized Medical Center in Saint-Petersburg, Russia. The dataset, which was exported from the medical information system, consisted of structured and semi-structured data, encompassing a total of 73,115 lines for 12,989 female patients. Our proposed approach, which includes a detailed analysis of predictive model performance and interpretability, offers numerous opportunities for decision support in perinatal care provision. The high predictive performance achieved by our models ensures precise support for both individual patient care and overall health organization management.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) has been increasingly adopted in domains such as smart infrastructure, healthcare, supply chain, transportation, and many others. However, the constrained computational resources of these devices make conventional security approaches against security threats not applicable. This limitation emphasizes the need to explore new approaches, specifically tailored to these kinds of devices. To increase protection against cyberattacks in IoT devices, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are considered an effective approach. Machine Learning (ML) techniques can be combined with Federated Learning to enhance the privacy and scalability of these systems. Many IDSs have been introduced, but there is a research gap concerning Host Intrusion Detection System (HIDS), which is the primary focus of our current work. Additionally, existing research predominantly focuses on the application of ML techniques and their evaluation, with limited attention to real-world implementation. We propose a lightweight HIDS that relies on the analysis of system call traces to detect malicious activities. The proposed HIDS achieved an accuracy rate of approximately 98%. Finally, by using eXplainable Artificial Intelligence methods, we sought to provide explanations for these these results.

AB  - Internet of Health Things (IoHT) have allowed connected health paradigm ubiquitous. 5 G supported healthcare vertical allows IoHT to offer connected health monitoring with quality of service and ultra-low latency. Deep learning has shown potential in processing massive amount of IoHT data that are generated daily, automate connected healthcare workflows, and help in decision making processes. However, three important challenges need to be addressed to attain long term healthcare-related sustainability - data security, data privacy, and social acceptance of deep learning process. In this paper, we propose a framework that will allow healthcare sustainability through the following contributions 1) ensure privacy of training dataset, 2) support the aggregation of the global model gradients through a private Blockchain-brokered entity, 3) support trustworthiness and provenance of the federated clients by blockchain and off-chain, 4) share the dataset, train the model and share trained model among the federated clients in an encrypted fashion, and 5) add explainability and reasoning of deep learning process to make the model acceptable by the society. We will present the detailed design of our proposed sustainable system, the implementation details and test results. The test results show promising prospect of achieving sustainability of IoHT-enabled connected health applications.

AB  - Burnout in healthcare professionals (HCPs) is a global concern. Few studies use theoretical and conceptual models to assess work system stressors contributing to HCP burnout. A survey consisting of demographic characteristics and work system stressors based on the National Academy of Medicine's theoretical model was administered to 589 HCPs (participation rate: 64%). We compare four classifiers with four feature selection methods to predict HCP burnout. We use SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to prioritize key work system stressors contributing to HCP burnout and explain the predictions from the best model, random forest using recursive feature elimination (AUC: 0.75). Time pressure, work-life integration, inadequate technology, administrative burden, values and expectations, professional relationships, lack of recognition for QI activities, moral distress, and patient factors are the work system stressors that have the highest impact on predicting HCP burnout. Identifying and prioritizing key factors to mitigate HCP burnout is important for the healthcare system to allocate resources and improve patient safety and quality of care.

AB  - The rise of personalized medicine and its remarkable advancements have revealed new requirements for the availability of appropriate medical decision-making models. Computer science is an area that plays an essential role in the field of personalized medicine, where one of the goals is to provide algorithms and tools to extrapolate knowledge and improve the decision-support process. The minimum clinically important difference (MCID) is the smallest change in PROM scores that patients perceive as meaningful. Treatment that does not achieve the minimum level of improvement is considered inappropriate as well as a potential waste of resources. Using the MCID threshold to identify patients who fail to achieve the minimum change in PROM that results in a meaningful outcome may aid in pre-surgical shared decision-making. The decision tree algorithm is a method for extracting valuable information and providing further meaningful information to the domain expert that supports the decision-making. In the present study, different tools based on machine learning were developed. On the one hand, we compared three XGBoost models to predict the non-achievement of the MCID at six months post-operation in the SF-12 physical score. The prediction score threshold was set to 0.75 to provide three decision-making areas on the basis of the high confidence (HC) intervals; the minority class was re-balanced by weighting the positive class to penalize the loss function (XGBoost cost-sensitive), oversampling the minority class (XGBoost with SMOTE), and re-sampling the negative class (XGBoost with undersampling). On the other hand, we modeled the data through a decision tree (assessment tree), based on different complexity levels, to identify the hidden pattern and to provide a new way to understand possible relationships between the gathered features and the several outcomes. The results showed that all the proposed models were effective as binary classifiers, as they showed moderate predictive performance both regarding the minority or positive class (i.e., our targeted patients, those who will not benefit from surgery) and the negative class. The decision tree visualization can be exploited during the patient assessment status to better understand if those patients will benefit or not from the medical intervention. Both of these tools can come in handy for increasing knowledge about the patient's psychophysical state and for creating an increasingly specialized assessment of the individual patient.

AB  - BackgroundCrowding has been a longstanding issue in emergency departments. To address this, a fast-track system for avoidable patients is being implemented in the Paediatric Emergency Department where our study is conducted. Our goal is to develop an optimized Decision Support System that helps in directing patients to this fast track. We evaluated various Machine Learning models, focusing on a balance between complexity, predictive performance, and interpretability.MethodsThis is a retrospective study considering all visits to a university-affiliated metropolitan hospital's PED between 2014 and 2019. Using information available at the time of triage, we trained several models to predict whether a visit is avoidable and should be directed to a fast-track area.ResultsA total of 507,708 visits to the PED were used in the training and testing of the models. Regarding the outcome, 41.6% of the visits were considered avoidable. Except for the classification made by triage rules, i.e. considering levels 1,2, and 3 as non-avoidable and 4 and 5 as avoidable, all models had similar results in model's evaluation metrics, e.g. Area Under the Curve ranging from 74% to 80%.ConclusionsRegarding predictive performance, the pruned decision tree had evaluation metrics results that were comparable to the other ML models. Furthermore, it offers a low complexity and easy to implement solution. When considering interpretability, a paramount requisite in healthcare since it relates to the trustworthiness and transparency of the system, the pruned decision tree excels.Overall, this paper contributes to the growing body of research on the use of machine learning in healthcare. It highlights practical benefits for patients and healthcare systems of the use ML-based DSS in emergency medicine. Moreover, the obtained results can potentially help to design patients' flow management strategies in PED settings, which has been sought as a solution for addressing the long-standing problem of overcrowding.ConclusionsRegarding predictive performance, the pruned decision tree had evaluation metrics results that were comparable to the other ML models.

AB  - In response to recent proposals to utilize artificial intelligence (AI) to automate ethics consultations in healthcare, we raise two main problems for the prospect of having healthcare professionals rely on AI-driven programs to provide ethical guidance in clinical matters. The first cause for concern is that, because these programs would effectively function like black boxes, this approach seems to preclude the kind of transparency that would allow clinical staff to explain and justify treatment decisions to patients, fellow caregivers, and those tasked with providing oversight. The other main problem is that the kind of authority that would need to be given to the guidance issuing from these programs in order to do the work set out for them would mean that clinical staff would not be empowered to provide meaningful safeguards against it in those cases when its recommendations are morally problematic.

AB  - Remote patient monitoring and data management have gained much popularity in recent years because of their enhanced access to low-cost healthcare services. A cloud-based healthcare system provides numerous solutions for collecting patient data and offers on-demand well-managed reports to patients and healthcare providers. However, it equally suffers from single-point failure, security, privacy, and non-transparency issues with the data, impacting the continuity of the system. To resolve such concerns, this article proposes an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled decentralized healthcare framework that accesses and authenticates Internet of Things (IoT) devices and create trust and transparency in patient healthcare records (PHR). The mechanism is based on the AI-enabled smart contracts and the conceptualization of the public blockchain network. Alongside this, the framework identifies the malicious IoT nodes in the system. The experimental analyses are performed on the real-time test environment, and significant improvements are suggested in terms of device energy consumption, data request time, throughput, average latency, and transaction fee.

AB  - Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) has emerged as a cornerstone of modern drug development, providing a robust framework to integrate data from preclinical and clinical studies, enhance decision-making, and optimize therapeutic strategies. By modeling biological systems and drug interactions, QSP enables predictions of outcomes, optimization of dosing regimens, and personalized medicine applications. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) hold the potential to significantly transform QSP by enabling enhanced data extraction, fostering the development of hybrid mechanistic ML models, and supporting the introduction of surrogate models and digital twins. This manuscript explores the transformative role of AI and ML in reshaping QSP modeling workflows. AI/ML tools now enable automated literature mining, the generation of dynamic models from data, and the creation of hybrid frameworks that blend mechanistic insights with data-driven approaches. Large Language Models (LLMs) further revolutionize the field by transitioning AI/ML from merely a tool to becoming an active partner in QSP modeling. By facilitating interdisciplinary collaboration, lowering barriers to entry, and democratizing QSP workflows, LLMs empower researchers without deep coding expertise to engage in complex modeling tasks. Additionally, the integration of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) holds the potential to autonomously propose, refine, and validate models, further accelerating innovation across multiscale biological processes. Key challenges remain in integrating AI/ML into QSP workflows, particularly in ensuring rigorous validation pipelines, addressing ethical considerations, and establishing robust regulatory frameworks to address the reliability and reproducibility of AI-assisted models. Moreover, the complexity of multiscale biological integration, effective data management, and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration present ongoing hurdles. Despite these challenges, the potential of AI/ML to enhance hybrid model development, improve model interpretability, and democratize QSP modeling offers an exciting opportunity to revolutionize drug development and therapeutic innovation. This work highlights a pathway toward a transformative era for QSP, leveraging advancements in AI and ML to address these challenges and drive innovation in the field.

AB  - Machine learning is considered a promising method for developing building energy-benchmarking mod-els. However, the high dimensionality of building energy datasets can reduce model accuracy and gener-alization but increase the computational cost. Meanwhile, the poor interpretability of machine learning models limits the understanding of insights and, in turn, hinders policymaking. Therefore, the first objec-tive of this study was to investigate the benefits of feature selection on the performance of machine learning-based energy usage models. Three typical feature selection methods (filter, wrapper, and embedded) were selected, and the effect of each method was evaluated based on three tree-ensemble learning algorithms. Another objective was to analyze the interpretability of the machine learning model using the Shapley additive explanation method. The results were obtained using a city-scale energy con-sumption dataset consisting of 478 healthcare buildings in Chongqing, China. It was found that the wrap-per method generally improved the accuracy of the machine learning models compared to that of the other two methods. In addition, the model developed using extreme gradient boosting combined with the wrapper method achieved the best accuracy. Moreover, the model interpretability analysis demon-strated important features and revealed how these features influence energy use for individual buildings.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) is moving towards the health space. It is generally acknowledged that, while there is great promise in the implementation of AI technologies in healthcare, it also raises important ethical issues. In this study we surveyed medical doctors based in The Netherlands, Portugal, and the U.S. from a diverse mix of medical specializations about the ethics surrounding Health AI. Four main perspectives have emerged from the data representing different views about this matter. The first perspective (AI is a helpful tool: Let physicians do what they were trained for) highlights the efficiency associated with automation, which will allow doctors to have the time to focus on expanding their medical knowledge and skills. The second perspective (Rules & Regulations are crucial: Private companies only think about money) shows strong distrust in private tech companies and emphasizes the need for regulatory oversight. The third perspective (Ethics is enough: Private companies can be trusted) puts more trust in private tech companies and maintains that ethics is sufficient to ground these corporations. And finally the fourth perspective (Explainable AI tools: Learning is necessary and inevitable) emphasizes the importance of explainability of AI tools in order to ensure that doctors are engaged in the technological progress. Each perspective provides valuable and often contrasting insights about ethical issues that should be operationalized and accounted for in the design and development of AI Health.

AB  - The global burden of diabetes mellitus (DM) continues to escalate, posing significant challenges to healthcare systems worldwide. This study compares machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods, their hybrids, and ensemble strategies for predicting the health outcomes of diabetic patients. This work aims to find the best solutions that strike a balance between computational efficiency and accurate prediction. The study systematically assessed a range of predictive models, including sophisticated DL techniques and conventional ML algorithms, based on computational efficiency and performance indicators. The study assessed prediction accuracy, processing speed, scalability, resource consumption, and interpretability using publicly accessible diabetes datasets. It methodically evaluates the selected models using key performance indicators (KPIs), training times, and memory usage. AdaBoost had the highest F1-score (0.74) on PIMA-768, while RF excelled on PIMA-2000 (similar to 0.73). An RNN led the 3-class BRFSS survey (0.44), and a feed-forward DNN excelled on the binary BRFSS subset (0.45), while RF also achieved perfect accuracy on the EMR dataset (1.00) confirming that model performance is tightly coupled to each dataset's scale, feature mix and label structure. The results highlight how lightweight, interpretable ML and DL models work in resource-constrained environments and for real-time health analytics. The study also compares its results with existing prediction models, confirming the benefits of selected ML approaches in enhancing diabetes-related medical outcomes that are substantial for practical implementation, providing a reliable and efficient framework for automated diabetes prediction to support initiative-taking disease management techniques and tailored treatment. The study concludes the essentiality of conducting a thorough assessment and validation of the model using current institutional datasets as this enhances accuracy, security, and confidence in AI-assisted healthcare decision-making.

AB  - Background Lumbar spinal stenosis is one of the most common surgery-requiring conditions of the spine in the aged population. As elderly patients often present with multiple comorbidities and limited physiological reserve, individualized risk assessment using comprehensive geriatric assessment is crucial for optimizing surgical outcomes. Methods Patients 65 years or older who underwent elective surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis between June 2015 and December 2018 were prospectively enrolled, resulting in 261 eligible patients of age 72.3 +/- 4.8 years (male 108, female 153). Twenty-seven experienced complications of Clavien-Dindo grade 2 or higher within 30 days, and 79 received transfusion during hospital stay. The cohort was split into train-validation (n = 208) and test (n = 53) sets. A total of 48 features, including demographics, comorbidity, nutrition, and perioperative status, were collected. Logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), random forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM were trained using five-fold cross-validation. AUROC and AUPRC were considered the primary performance metrics, and the results were compared with those estimated with ACS-NSQIP scoring system. A set of Compact models incorporating a smaller number of features was also trained, and SHAP analysis was conducted to evaluate the models' interpretability. Results The reduced number of features did not result in the drop of AUROC and AUPRC for all machine learning algorithms (P > 0.05). when compared to the ACS-NSQIP scoring system, which achieved a test AUROC of 0.38 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.13-0.73) and 0.22 (95% CI, 0.10-0.36) on the first two tasks, the Compact model showed significantly greater AUROC values nearing or surpassing 0.90. Decision tree-based algorithms demonstrated larger test AUROC than logistic regression and generally agreed on the most influential features for each task. Conclusions Advanced machine learning models have consistently shown greater performance and interpretability over conventional methodologies, implying their potential for a more individualized risk assessment of the aged population.

AB  - With the extensive use of Machine Learning (ML) in the biomedical field, there was an increasing need for Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to improve transparency and reveal complex hidden relationships between variables for medical practitioners, while meeting regulatory requirements. Feature Selection (FS) is widely used as a part of a biomedical ML pipeline to significantly reduce the number of variables while preserving as much information as possible. However, the choice of FS methods affects the entire pipeline including the final prediction explanations, whereas very few works investigate the relationship between FS and model explanations. Through a systematic workflow performed on 145 datasets and an illustration on medical data, the present work demonstrated the promising complementarity of two metrics based on explanations (using ranking and influence changes) in addition to accuracy and retention rate to select the most appropriate FS/ML models. Measuring how much explanations differ with/without FS are particularly promising for FS methods recommendation. While reliefF generally performs the best on average, the optimal choice may vary for each dataset. Positioning FS methods in a tridimensional space, integrating explanations-based metrics, accuracy and retention rate, would allow the user to choose the priorities to be given on each of the dimensions. In biomedical applications, where each medical condition may have its own preferences, this framework will make it possible to offer the healthcare professional the appropriate FS technique, to select the variables that have an important explainable impact, even if this comes at the expense of a limited drop of accuracy.

AB  - Intelligent systems have been rapidly evolving and play a pivotal role in assisting individuals across diverse domains, from healthcare to transportation. Understanding the dynamics of human-artificial intelligence (AI) partnering, particularly how humans trust and collaborate with intelligent systems, is becoming increasingly critical to design effective systems. This paper presents an experimental analysis to assess the impact of AI design attributes on users' trust, workload, and performance when solving classification problems supported by an AI assistant. Specifically, we study the effect of transparency, fairness, and robustness in the design of an AI assistant and analyze the role of participants' gender and education background on the outcomes. The experiment is conducted with 47 students in undergraduate, master's, and Ph.D. programs using a drawing game application where the users are asked to recognize incomplete sketches revealed progressively while receiving recommendations from multiple versions of an AI assistant. The results show that when collaborating with the AI, participants achieve a higher performance than their individual performance or the performance of the AI. The results also show that gender does not have an impact on users' trust and performance when collaborating with different versions of the AI system, whereas education level has a significant impact on the participants' performance but not on trust. Finally, the impact of design attributes on participants' trust and performance highly depends on the accuracy of the AI recommendations, and improvements in participants' performance and trust in some cases come at the expense of increased workload.

AB  - Background Natural language processing (NLP) based clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) have demonstrated the ability to extract vital information from patient electronic health records (EHRs) to facilitate important decision support tasks. While obtaining accurate, medical domain interpretable results is crucial, it is demanding because real-world EHRs contain many inconsistencies and inaccuracies. Further, testing of such machine learning-based systems in clinical practice has received limited attention and are yet to be accepted by clinicians for regular use. Methods We present our results from the evaluation of an NLP-driven CDSS developed and implemented in a Norwegian Hospital. The system incorporates unsupervised and supervised machine learning combined with rule-based algorithms for clinical concept-based searching to identify and classify allergies of concern for anesthesia and intensive care. The system also implements a semi-supervised machine learning approach to automatically annotate medical concepts in the narrative. Results Evaluation of system adoption was performed by a mixed methods approach applying The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) as a theoretical lens. Most of the respondents demonstrated a high degree of system acceptance and expressed a positive attitude towards the system in general and intention to use the system in the future. Increased detection of patient allergies, and thus improved quality of practice and patient safety during surgery or ICU stays, was perceived as the most important advantage of the system. Conclusions Our combined machine learning and rule-based approach benefits system performance, efficiency, and interpretability. The results demonstrate that the proposed CDSS increases detection of patient allergies, and that the system received high-level acceptance by the clinicians using it. Useful recommendations for further system improvements and implementation initiatives are reducing the quantity of alarms, expansion of the system to include more clinical concepts, closer EHR system integration, and more workstations available at point of care.

We conducted a cross-country comparison of physician perceptions on the barriers and facilita -tors in accepting an AI-enabled CDSS for antibiotic prescribing. Methods: We conducted in-depth interviews with physicians from the National Centre for Infectious Dis-eases (NCID), Singapore, and Christian Medical College Vellore (CMCV), India, between April and Decem -ber 2022. Our semi-structured in-depth interview guides were anchored on Venkatesh's UTAUT model. We used clinical vignettes to illustrate the application of AI in clinical decision support for antibiotic prescribing and explore medico-legal concerns. Results: Most NCID physicians felt that an AI-enabled CDSS could facilitate antibiotic prescribing, while most CMCV physicians were sceptical about the tool's utility. The hesitancy in adopting an AI-enabled CDSS stems from concerns about the lack of validated and successful examples, fear of losing autonomy and clinical skills, difficulty of use, and impediment in work efficiency. Physicians from both sites felt that a user-friendly interface, integration with workflow, transparency of output, a guiding medico-legal framework, and training and technical support would improve the uptake of an AI-enabled CDSS. Conclusion: In conclusion, the acceptance of AI-enabled CDSSs depends on the physician's confidence with the tool's recommendations, perceived ease of use, familiarity with AI, the organisation's digital culture and support, and the presence of medico-legal governance of AI. Progressive implementation and continuous feedback are essential to allay scepticism around the utility of AI-enabled CDSSs.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Despite the unprecedented performance of deep learning algorithms in clinical domains, full reviews of algorithmic predictions by human experts remain mandatory. Under these circumstances, artificial intelligence (AI) models are primarily designed as clinical decision support systems (CDSSs). However, from the perspective of clinical practitioners, the lack of clinical interpretability and user-centered interfaces hinders the adoption of these AI systems in practice.
   Objective: This study aims to develop an AI-based CDSS for assisting polysomnographic technicians in reviewing AI-predicted sleep staging results. This study proposed and evaluated a CDSS that provides clinically sound explanations for AI predictions in a user-centered manner.
   Methods: Our study is based on a user-centered design framework for developing explanations in a CDSS that identifies why explanations are needed, what information should be contained in explanations, and how explanations can be provided in the CDSS. We conducted user interviews, user observation sessions, and an iterative design process to identify three key aspects for designing explanations in the CDSS. After constructing the CDSS, the tool was evaluated to investigate how the CDSS explanations helped technicians. We measured the accuracy of sleep staging and interrater reliability with macro-F1 and Cohen kappa scores to assess quantitative improvements after our tool was adopted. We assessed qualitative improvements through participant interviews that established how participants perceived and used the tool.
   Results: The user study revealed that technicians desire explanations that are relevant to key electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns for sleep staging when assessing the correctness of AI predictions. Here, technicians wanted explanations that could be used to evaluate whether the AI models properly locate and use these patterns during prediction. On the basis of this, information that is closely related to sleep EEG patterns was formulated for the AI models. In the iterative design phase, we developed a different visualization strategy for each pattern based on how technicians interpreted the EEG recordings with these patterns during their workflows. Our evaluation study on 9 polysomnographic technicians quantitatively and qualitatively investigated the helpfulness of the tool. For technicians with <5 years of work experience, their quantitative sleep staging performance improved significantly from 56.75 to 60.59 with a P value of .05. Qualitatively, participants reported that the information provided effectively supported them, and they could develop notable adoption strategies for the tool.
   Conclusions: Our findings indicate that formulating clinical explanations for automated predictions using the information in the AI with a user-centered design process is an effective strategy for developing a CDSS for sleep staging.

AB  - Coronaviruses have affected the lives of people around the world. Increasingly, studies have indicated that the virus is mutating and becoming more contagious. Hence, the pressing priority is to swiftly and accurately predict patient outcomes. In addition, physicians and patients increasingly need interpretability when building machine models in healthcare. We propose an interpretable machine framework(KISM) that can diagnose and prognose patients based on blood test datasets. First, we use k-nearest neighbors, isolated forests, and SMOTE to pre-process the original blood test datasets. Seven machine learning tools Support Vector Machine, Extra Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, and ensemble learning were then used to diagnose and predict COVID-19. In addition, we used SHAP and scikit-learn post-hoc interpretability to report feature importance, allowing healthcare professionals and artificial intelligence models to interact to suggest biomarkers that some doctors may have missed. The 10-fold cross-validation of two public datasets shows that the performance of KISM is better than that of the current state-of-the-art methods. In the diagnostic COVID-19 task, an AUC value of 0.9869 and an accuracy of 0.9787 were obtained, and ultimately Leukocytes, platelets, and Proteina C reativa mg/dL were found to be the most indicative biomarkers for the diagnosis of COVID-19. An AUC value of 0.9949 and an accuracy of 0.9677 were obtained in the prognostic COVID-19 task and Age, LYMPH, and WBC were found to be the most indicative biomarkers for identifying the severity of the patient.

AB  - Background The lack of transparency is a prevalent issue among the current machine-learning (ML) algorithms utilized for predicting mortality risk. Herein, we aimed to improve transparency by utilizing the latest ML explicable technology, SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP), to develop a predictive model for critically ill patients.Methods We extracted data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database, encompassing all intensive care unit admissions. We employed nine different methods to develop the models. The most accurate model, with the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, was selected as the optimal model. Additionally, we used SHAP to explain the workings of the ML model.Results The study included 21 395 critically ill patients, with a median age of 68 years (interquartile range, 56-79 years), and most patients were male (56.9%). The cohort was randomly split into a training set (N = 16 046) and a validation set (N = 5349). Among the nine models developed, the Random Forest model had the highest accuracy (87.62%) and the best area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value (0.89). The SHAP summary analysis showed that Glasgow Coma Scale, urine output, and blood urea nitrogen were the top three risk factors for outcome prediction. Furthermore, SHAP dependency analysis and SHAP force analysis were used to interpret the Random Forest model at the factor level and individual level, respectively.Conclusion A transparent ML model for predicting outcomes in critically ill patients using SHAP methodology is feasible and effective. SHAP values significantly improve the explainability of ML models. Key messages What is already known on this topic? The lack of transparency is a prevalent issue among the current machine-learning (ML) algorithms utilized for predicting mortality risk. What this study adds? We successfully developed a high-performance ML model for the prediction of in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients (accuracy: 87.62%; area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.89), and utilized a latest ML interpretable technology called SHapley Additive exPlanation, to increase model transparency. How this study might affect research, practice, or policy? Our findings could assist healthcare providers in identifying high-risk factors contributing to mortality in daily clinical practice. This, in turn, could help optimize the alignment of care goals and improve healthcare resource utilization.

AB  - Sepsis, a dysregulated immune system response to infection, is among the leading causes of morbidity, mortality, and cost overruns in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Early prediction of sepsis can improve situational awareness among clinicians and facilitate timely, protective interventions. While the application of predictive analytics in ICU patients has shown early promising results, much of the work has been encumbered by high false-alarm rates and lack of trust by the end-users due to the ?black box? nature of these models. Here, we present DeepAISE (Deep Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert), a recurrent neural survival model for the early prediction of sepsis. DeepAISE automatically learns predictive features related to higher-order interactions and temporal patterns among clinical risk factors that maximize the data likelihood of observed time to septic events. A comparative study of four baseline models on data from hospitalized patients at three different healthcare systems indicates that DeepAISE produces the most accurate predictions (AUCs between 0.87 and 0.90) at the lowest false alarm rates (FARs between 0.20 and 0.25) while simultaneously producing interpretable representations of the clinical time series and risk factors.

AB  - Background/aimsEarly recognition of eyelid morphological abnormalities was crucial, as untreated conditions could lead to blinding complications. An eyelid screening system that could provide both anatomical and pathological information was essential for formulating personalized treatment strategies. This study aimed to develop a clinically concerns-based framework capable of identifying common eyelid diseases requiring further intervention by evaluating individual anatomical and pathological changes. This approach would enhance individualized and efficient prevention, while supporting targeted treatment strategies.MethodsThe eyelid disorder screening system, Eyetome, was developed based on a morphological atlas and comprised four modules designed to identify 14 common eyelid disorders and pathological changes. A total of 6180 eye patches were analyzed to extract anatomical and pathological features. The performance of Eyetome was evaluated using average accuracy (aACC) and F1 score, with comparisons made against traditional models and ophthalmologists. To assess the system's expandability, an additional test was conducted in a multimorbidity scenario.ResultsEyetome demonstrated high performance in recognizing single diseases, achieving an aACC of 98.83% and an F1 score of 0.93. The system outperformed classic models, with an aACC of 98.83% compared to 96.72% for Desnet101 and 97.59% for Vit. Additionally, Eyetome's aACC exceeded that of a junior ophthalmologist (JO) (97.11%) and was comparable to a senior ophthalmologist (SO) (98.69%). In the extended multimorbidity dataset, Eyetome maintained robust performance with an accuracy of 97.97%, surpassing JO (95.47%) and closely matching SO (97.81%).ConclusionsThis study developed a clinical concerns-based system for screening and monitoring eyelid disorders, aimed at supporting predictive diagnosis, preventing diseases progression, and facilitating more effective, patient-centered treatment of common eyelid disorders, aligning with the principles of predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine (PPPM/3PM). The system's interpretability, scalability, and user-friendly data acquisition design could further enhance its acceptance among both doctors and patients, facilitating the shift from reactive medicine to proactive precision medicine.

AB  - Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a non-invasive way to observe brain activity in real time. Deep learning has enhanced EEG analysis, enabling meaningful pattern detection for clinical and research purposes. However, most existing frameworks for EEG data analysis are either focused on preprocessing techniques or deep learning model development, often overlooking the crucial need for structured documentation and model interpretability. In this paper, we introduce DREAMS (Deep REport for AI ModelS), a Python-based framework designed to generate automated model cards for deep learning models applied to EEG data. Unlike generic model reporting tools, DREAMS is specifically tailored for EEG-based deep learning applications, incorporating domain-specific metadata, preprocessing details, performance metrics, and uncertainty quantification. The framework seamlessly integrates with deep learning pipelines, providing structured YAMLbased documentation. We evaluate DREAMS through two case studies: an EEG emotion classification task using the FACED dataset and a abnormal EEG classification task using the Temple University Hospital (TUH) Abnormal dataset. These evaluations demonstrate how the generated model card enhances transparency by documenting model performance, dataset biases, and interpretability limitations. Unlike existing model documentation approaches, DREAMS provides visualized performance metrics, dataset alignment details, and model uncertainty estimations, making it a valuable tool for researchers and clinicians working with EEG-based AI. The source code for DREAMS is open-source, facilitating broad adoption in healthcare AI, research, and ethical AI development.

AB  - Over the decades, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning has become a transformative solution in many sectors, services, and technology platforms in a wide range of applications, such as in smart healthcare, financial, political, and surveillance systems. In such applications, a large amount of data is generated about diverse aspects of our life. Although utilizing AI in real-world applications provides numerous opportunities for societies and industries, it raises concerns regarding data privacy. Data used in an AI system are cleaned, integrated, and processed throughout the AI life cycle. Each of these stages can introduce unique threats to individual's privacy and have an impact on ethical processing and protection of data. In this paper, we examine privacy risks in different phases of the AI life cycle and review the existing privacy-enhancing solutions. We introduce four different categories of privacy risk, including (i) risk of identification, (ii) risk of making an inaccurate decision, (iii) risk of non-transparency in AI systems, and (iv) risk of non-compliance with privacy regulations and best practices. We then examined the potential privacy risks in each AI life cycle phase, evaluated concerns, and reviewed privacy-enhancing technologies, requirements, and process solutions to countermeasure these risks. We also reviewed some of the existing privacy protection policies and the need for compliance with available privacy regulations in AI-based systems. The main contribution of this survey is examining privacy challenges and solutions, including technology, process, and privacy legislation in the entire AI life cycle. In each phase of the AI life cycle, open challenges have been identified.

TI  - Training calibration-based counterfactual explainers for deep learning models in medical image analysis
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA  - English
AB  - The rapid adoption of artificial intelligence methods in healthcare is coupled with the critical need for techniques to rigorously introspect models and thereby ensure that they behave reliably. This has led to the design of explainable AI techniques that uncover the relationships between discernible data signatures and model predictions. In this context, counterfactual explanations that synthesize small, interpretable changes to a given query while producing desired changes in model predictions have become popular. This under-constrained, inverse problem is vulnerable to introducing irrelevant feature manipulations, particularly when the model's predictions are not well-calibrated. Hence, in this paper, we propose the TraCE (training calibration-based explainers) technique, which utilizes a novel uncertainty-based interval calibration strategy for reliably synthesizing counterfactuals. Given the wide-spread adoption of machine-learned solutions in radiology, our study focuses on deep models used for identifying anomalies in chest X-ray images. Using rigorous empirical studies, we demonstrate the superiority of TraCE explanations over several state-of-the-art baseline approaches, in terms of several widely adopted evaluation metrics. Our findings show that TraCE can be used to obtain a holistic understanding of deep models by enabling progressive exploration of decision boundaries, to detect shortcuts, and to infer relationships between patient attributes and disease severity.

AB  - BackgroundCholestasis, characterized by impaired bile flow, impacts cognitive function through systemic mechanisms, including inflammation and metabolic dysregulation. Despite its significance, targeted predictive models for cognitive impairment in cholestasis remain underexplored. This study addresses this gap by developing a machine learning-based predictive model tailored to this population.MethodsClinical and biochemical data from Qingyang People's Hospital (2021-2023) were used to train and validate models for predicting cognitive impairment (MoCA <= 17). Recursive feature elimination identified critical predictors, while LightGBM and other machine learning models were evaluated. SHAP analysis enhanced model interpretability, and clinical utility was assessed through decision curve analysis (DCA).ResultsLightGBM outperformed other models with an AUC of 0.7955 on the testing dataset. Age, plasma D-dimer, and albumin were key predictors. SHAP analysis revealed non-linear interactions among features, demonstrating the model's clinical alignment. DCA confirmed its utility in improving patient stratification.ConclusionThe developed LightGBM-based model effectively predicts cognitive impairment in cholestasis patients, providing actionable insights for early intervention. Integrating this tool into clinical workflows can enhance precision medicine and improve outcomes in this high-risk population.

AB  - This study proposes an advanced computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) framework for thyroid disease diagnosis that integrates numerical patient data and ultrasound images. The framework uses cutting edge technologies, including Vision Transformers (ViTs) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAPs), to increase diagnostic accuracy, interpretability, and clinical applicability. The proposed CAD framework employs the sparse search algorithm (SSA) for optimized feature selection from numerical data and the tree-structured Parzen estimator for tuning the hyperparameters. ViTs are utilized for analyzing thyroid ultrasound images, whereas SHAP provides explainable AI insights into model predictions. Extensive experiments were conducted on two datasets: the thyroid disease patient dataset and the DDTI: Thyroid Ultrasound Images dataset. Performance was evaluated via five-fold and ten-fold cross-validation utilizing metrics including accuracy, precision, and recall. The framework achieved promising performance, with models trained without data augmentation consistently outperforming their augmented counterparts. For the thyroid disease patient dataset, the best-performing model reported an accuracy of 99.71%, precision of 97.05%, recall of 99.29%, and F1-score of 98.16%. For the DDTI dataset, ViTs achieved an accuracy of 95.06% without augmentation, surpassing existing methodologies. Key features such as thyroxine, thyroid surgery, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) were identified as critical predictors of thyroid conditions. This study underscores the potentiality of AI-driven approaches in healthcare, paving the way for improved diagnostic outcomes and personalized treatment strategies.

AB  - Recent advancements in machine learning and deep learning have significantly improved the diagnosis, detection, prediction, and prognosis of depressive disorders. However, these methodologies have issues related to generalizability, transparency, data scarcity, privacy concerns, and class imbalance. This study develops a robust and interpretable model for predicting depression in South Korea, addressing these limitations. We employed a hybrid deep learning approach that integrates the Feature Tokenizer Transformer model, specifically designed for tabular data, to effectively tokenize and process categorical and numerical features, alongside synthetic data generated by the tabular variational autoencoder (TVAE). TVAE is an adaptation of variational autoencoders that uses a specialized loss function for tabular data. generated high-quality synthetic data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) dataset. The efficacy of the TVAE-generated data was validated using non-parametric statistical tests, achieving 86.30% on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and 76.65% on the Chi-squared test. Performance evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, recall, F1-score, and AUC, demonstrated our model's effectiveness, yielding an accuracy 0.7783, a recall score of 0.5310, an F1-score of 0.4657, and an AUC of 0.6822, outperforming state-of-the-art models. Additionally, SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis was incorporated to explain feature importance, offering valuable insights for healthcare professionals. This research highlights the potential of deep learning and synthetic data generation techniques to enhance depression prediction, addressing critical challenges such as generalizability, class imbalance, data privacy, and interpretability over existing models.

AB  - Background: The purpose of this study was to carry out the bioinformatic analysis of lncRNA data obtained from the genomic analysis of kidney tissue samples taken from rats with nephrotoxicity induced by methotrexate (MTX) and from rats without pathology and modeling with the tree-based machine learning method. Another aim of the study was to identify potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of nephrotoxicity and to provide a better understanding of the nephrotoxicity formation process by providing the interpretability of the model with explainable artificial intelligence methods as a result of the modeling. Methods: To identify potential indicators of drug-induced nephrotoxicity, 20 female Wistar albino rats were separated into two groups: MTX-treated and the control. Kidney tissue samples were collected from the rats, and genomic, histological, and immunohistochemical analyses were performed. The dataset obtained as a result of genomic analysis was modeled with random forest (RF), a tree-based method. Modeling results were evaluated with sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), balanced accuracy (B-Acc), negative predictive value (Npv), accuracy (Acc), positive predictive value (Ppv), and F1-score performance metrics. The local interpretable model-agnostic annotations (LIME) method was used to determine the lncRNAs that could be biomarkers for nephrotoxicity by providing the interpretability of the RF model. Results: The outcomes of the histological and immunohistochemical analyses conducted in the study support the conclusion that MTX use caused kidney injury. According to the results of the bioinformatics analysis, 52 lncRNAs showed different expressions in the groups. As a result of modeling with RF for lncRNAs selected with Boruta variable selection, the B-Acc, Acc, Sp, Se, Npv, Ppv, and F1-score were 88.9%, 90%, 90.9%, 88.9%, 90.9%, 88.9%, and 88.9%, respectively. lncRNAs with id rnaXR_591534.3 rnaXR_005503408.1, rnaXR_005495645.1, rnaXR_001839007.2, rnaXR_005492056.1, and rna_XR_005492522.1. The lncRNAs with the highest variable importance values produced from RF modeling can be used as nephrotoxicity biomarker candidates. Furthermore, according to the LIME results, the high level of lncRNAs with id rnaXR_591534.3 and rnaXR_005503408.1 particularly increased the possibility of nephrotoxicity. Conclusions: With the possible biomarkers resulting from the analyses in this study, it can be ensured that the procedures for the diagnosis of drug-induced nephrotoxicity can be carried out easily, quickly, and effectively.

AB  - Machine learning and data mining techniques have been developed rapidly in recent times. In tasks such as classification, machine learning techniques have been shown to equal to and even surpass human performance. However, high performance models are usually complex, opaque and have low interpretability thus making it difficult to explain the underlying behaviors of those models that lead to the final outcomes. In many domains such as medicine and healthcare, interpretability is one of the most important factors when considering the adoption of those models. In this paper, we propose a two-stage binary classification system applicable for healthcare (or general) data that benefits from a high level of interpretability and can at the same time achieve the results comparable to commonly used classification techniques. The motivation behind the proposed system is the lack of effective classification methods for handling data generated by various distributions (such as healthcare or banking data) that can harmonize both performance and interpretability perspectives. In this work, we tackle the problem by applying divide and conquer strategy on a new disentangled representation of the underlying data. The merit of our system is evaluated by a classification experiment with a wide range of real data and popular transparent and black-box models. Furthermore, a use case in data of sepsis patients staying in the ICU (Intensive Care Unit) is depicted to prove the interpretability of the proposed model.

AB  - The safety-critical scenarios of artificial intelligence (AI), such as autonomous driving, Internet of Things, smart healthcare, etc., have raised critical requirements of trustworthy AI to guarantee the privacy and security with reliable decisions. As a nascent branch for trustworthy AI, federated learning (FL) has been regarded as a promising privacy preserving framework for training a global AI model over collaborative devices. However, security challenges still exist in the FL framework, e.g., Byzantine attacks from malicious devices, and model tampering attacks from malicious server, which will degrade or destroy the accuracy of trained global AI model. In this article, we shall propose a decentralized blockchain-based FL (B-FL) architecture by using a secure global aggregation algorithm to resist malicious devices, and deploying a practical Byzantine fault tolerance consensus protocol with high effectiveness and low energy consumption among multiple edge servers to prevent model tampering from the malicious server. However, to implement B-FL system at the network edge, multiple rounds of cross-validation in blockchain consensus protocol will induce long training latency. We thus formulate a network optimization problem that jointly considers bandwidth and power allocation for the minimization of long-term average training latency consisting of progressive learning rounds. We further propose to transform the network optimization problem as a Markov decision process and leverage the deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm to provide high system performance with low computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that B-FL can resist malicious attacks from edge devices and servers, and the training latency of B-FL can be significantly reduced by the DRL-based algorithm compared with the baseline algorithms.

AB  - Background Machine learning (ML) holds the promise of becoming an essential tool for utilising the increasing amount of clinical data available for analysis and clinical decision support. However, the lack of trust in the models has limited the acceptance of this technology in healthcare. This mistrust is often credited to the shortage of model explainability and interpretability, where the relationship between the input and output of the models is unclear. Improving trust requires the development of more transparent ML methods. Methods In this paper, we use the publicly available eICU database to construct a number of ML models before examining their internal behaviour with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values. Our four models predicted hospital mortality in ICU patients using a selection of the same features used to calculate the APACHE IV score and were based on random forest, logistic regression, naive Bayes, and adaptive boosting algorithms. Results The results showed the models had similar discriminative abilities and mostly agreed on feature importance while calibration and impact of individual features differed considerably and did in multiple cases not correspond to common medical theory. Conclusions We already know that ML models treat data differently depending on the underlying algorithm. Our comparative analysis visualises implications of these differences and their importance in a healthcare setting. SHAP value analysis is a promising method for incorporating explainability in model development and usage and might yield better and more trustworthy ML models in the future.

AB  - Personalized medicine aims to tailor medical treatments to individual patients, and predicting drug responses from molecular profiles using machine learning is crucial for this goal. However, the high dimensionality of the molecular profiles compared to the limited number of samples presents significant challenges. Knowledge-based feature selection methods are particularly suitable for drug response prediction, as they leverage biological insights to reduce dimensionality and improve model interpretability. This study presents the first comparative evaluation of nine different knowledge-based and data-driven feature reduction methods on cell line and tumor data. Our analysis employs six distinct machine learning models, with a total of more than 6,000 runs to ensure a robust evaluation. Our findings indicate that transcription factor activities outperform other methods in predicting drug responses, effectively distinguishing between sensitive and resistant tumors for seven of the 20 drugs evaluated.

AB  - Ensemble models such as gradient boosting and random forests are proven to offer the best predictive performance on a wide variety of supervised learning problems. The high performance of these black box models, however, comes at a cost of model interpretability. They are also inadequate to meet regulatory demands and explainability needs of organizations. The model interpretability in high performance black-box models is achieved with the help of post-hoc explainable models such as Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). This paper presents an alternate intrinsic classifier model that extracts a class of higher order patterns and embeds them into an interpretable learning model. More specifically, the proposed model extracts novel High Utility Gain (HUG) patterns that capture higher order interactions, transforms the model input data into a new space, and applies interpretable classifier methods on the transformed space. We conduct rigorous experiments on forty benchmark binary and multi-class classification datasets to evaluate the proposed model against the state-of-the-art ensemble and interpretable classifier models. The proposed model was comprehensively assessed on three key dimensions: 1) quality of predictions using classifier measures such as accuracy, F-1, AUC, H-measure, and logistic loss, 2) computational performance on large and high-dimensional data, and 3) interpretability aspects. The HUG-based learning model was found to deliver performance comparable to that of the state-of-the-art ensemble models. Our model was also found to achieve 2-40% (45%) prediction quality (interpretability) improvements with significantly lower computational requirements over other interpretable classifier models. Furthermore, we present case studies in finance and healthcare domains and generate one- and two-dimensional HUG profiles to illustrate the interpretability aspects of our HUG models. The proposed solution offers an alternate approach to build high performance and transparent machine learning classifier models. We hope that our ML solution help organizations meet their growing regulatory and explainability needs.

AB  - BackgroundIn the last years, artificial intelligence (AI) has contributed to improving healthcare including dentistry. The objective of this study was to develop a machine learning (ML) model for early childhood caries (ECC) prediction by identifying crucial health behaviours within mother-child pairs.MethodsFor the analysis, we utilized a representative sample of 724 mothers with children under six years in Bangladesh. The study utilized both clinical and survey data. ECC was assessed using ICDAS II criteria in the clinical examinations. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Random Forest (RF) was applied to identify the optimal subsets of features. Random forest classifier (RFC), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), support vector machine (SVM), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) models were used to identify the best fitted model as the predictor of ECC. SHAP and MDG-MDA plots were visualized for model interpretability and identify significant predictors.ResultsThe RFC model identified 10 features as the most relevant for ECC prediction obtained by RFE feature selection method. The features were: plaque score, age of child, mother's education, number of siblings, age of mother, consumption of sweet, tooth cleaning tools, child's tooth brushing frequency, helping child brushing, and use of F-toothpaste. The final ML model achieved an AUC-ROC score (0.77), accuracy (0.72), sensitivity (0.80) and F1 score (0.73) in the test set. Of the prediction model, dental plaque was the strongest predictor of ECC (MDG: 0.08, MDA: 0.10).ConclusionsOur final ML model, integrating 10 key features, has the potential to predict ECC effectively in children under five years. Additional research is needed for validation and optimization across various groups.

AB  - Background: Pediatric growth assessment is crucial for early diagnosis and intervention in growth disorders. Traditional methods often lack accuracy and real-time decision-making capabilities This study explores the application of machine learning (ML), particularly logistic regression, to improve diagnostic precision and timeliness in pediatric growth assessment. Logistic regression is a reliable and easily interpretable model for detecting growth abnormalities in children. Unlike complex machine learning models, it offers parsimony in transparency, efficiency, and reproducibility, making it ideal for clinical settings where explainable, data-driven decisions are essential. Methods: A logistic regression model was developed using R to analyze biometric and demographic data from a cross-sectional dataset, including real-world data from public institucions. The study employed a bibliometric analysis to identify key trends and incorporated data preprocessing techniques such as cleaning, imputation, and feature selection to enhance model performance. Performance metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity, and the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, were utilized for evaluation. Results: The logistic regression model demonstrated an accuracy of 94.65% and a sensitivity of 91.03%, significantly improving the identification of growth anomalies compared to conventional assessment methods. The model's ROC curve showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.96, indicating excellent predictive capability. Findings highlight ML's potential in automating pediatric growth monitoring and supporting clinical decision-making, as it can be very simple and highly interpretable in clinical practice. Conclusions: ML, particularly logistic regression, offers a promising tool for pediatric healthcare by enhancing diagnostic precision and operational efficiency. Despite these advancements, challenges remain regarding data quality, clinical integration, and privacy concerns. Future research should focus on expanding dataset diversity, improving model interpretability, and conducting external validation to facilitate broader clinical adoption.

AB  - Motivation The integration of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) into healthcare has immense potential due to the rapidly growing volume of clinical data. However, existing AI models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4, face significant challenges in terms of explainability and reliability, particularly in high-stakes domains like healthcare.Results This paper proposes a novel LLM-aided feature engineering approach that enhances interpretability by extracting clinically relevant features from the Oxford Textbook of Medicine. By converting clinical notes into concept vector representations and employing a linear classifier, our method achieved an accuracy of 0.72, outperforming a traditional n-gram Logistic Regression baseline (0.64) and the GPT-4 baseline (0.48), while focusing on high-level clinical features. We also explore using Text Embeddings to reduce the overall time and cost of our approach by 97%.Availability and implementation All code relevant to this paper is available at: https://github.com/AdityaKashyap423/Dementia_LLM_Feature_Engineering/tree/main.

AB  - The increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a significant health concern worldwide. Effective and personalized treatment strategies are essential for improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. Machine learning (ML) has the potential to create clinical decision support systems (CDSS) that assist clinicians in making prediction-informed treatment decisions. This study aims to develop a novel predictive-prescriptive analytics framework that leverages ML to enhance medication prescriptions for T2D patients. The framework is designed as a data-driven CDSS to determine the best medication strategies based on individual patient profiles, including demographics, comorbidities, and medications. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset of electronic health records from 17,773 patients across various U.S. Veterans Administration Medical Centers collected over 12 years, the study employs the Bayesian Network (BN) as the ML model of choice. The BN's unique dual capability serves both predictive and prescriptive functions. Several BN learning algorithms are applied to map the relationships among patient features and decision variables for predicting the outcome. The prescriptive stage includes three strategies, i.e., forward, backward, and guideline-based, to identify optimal treatment recommendations. Next, the complex treatment pathways identified through the prescriptive stage were illustrated using rule-based and decision-tree presentations to improve interpretability for actionable insights and clinical usability. Finally, our empirical analysis examines the alignment between recommended treatment strategies and actual physician prescriptions. ML exhibited strong predictive performance with a precision of 0.789, a recall of 0.879, and an F1-score of 0.831. The recommended treatment strategies aligned with physician prescriptions in simpler treatment scenarios. However, the alignment decreased as the complexity of medication prescription increased, highlighting the challenges of achieving physician compliance with optimal strategies in complex scenarios. This underscores the greater need for CDSS, particularly in situations involving complex combination therapy. This study presents a novel ML-based CDSS framework for personalized T2D treatment. Leveraging ML, the framework offers a promising approach to optimizing medication prescriptions and improving patient outcomes.

T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS

KW  - CLASSIFICATION
KW  - BLOCKCHAIN
AB  - In recent times, automated detection of diseases from pathological images leveraging Machine Learning (ML) models has become fairly common, where the ML models learn detecting the disease by identifying biomarkers from the images. However, such an approach requires the models to be trained on a vast amount of data, and healthcare organizations often tend to limit access due to privacy concerns. Consequently, collecting data for traditional centralized training becomes challenging. These privacy concerns can be handled by Federation Learning (FL), which builds an unbiased global model from local models trained with client data while maintaining the confidentiality of local data. Using FL, this study solves the problem of centralized data collection by detecting deformations in images of Red Blood Cells (RBC) in a decentralized way. To achieve this, RBC data is used to train multiple Deep Learning (DL) models, and among the various DL models, the most efficient one is considered to be used as the global model inside the FL framework. The FL framework works by copying the global model's weight to the client's local models and then training the local models in client-specific devices to average the weights of the local model back to the global model. In the averaging process, direct averaging is performed and alongside, weighted averaging is also done to weigh the individual local model's contribution according to their performance, keeping the FL framework immune to the effects of bad clients and attacks. In the process, the data of the client remains confidential during training, while the global model learns necessary information. The results of the experiments indicate that there is no significant difference in the performance of the FL method and the best-performing DL model, as the best-performing DL model reaches an accuracy of 96% and the FL environment reaches 94%-95%. This study shows that the FL technique, in comparison to the classic DL methodology, can accomplish confidentiality secured RBC deformation classification from RBC images without substantially diminishing the accuracy of the categorization. Finally, the overall validity of the classification results has been verified by employing GradCam driven Explainable AI techniques.

AB  - Background The frequency of anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) has increased up to 400% since 2011, underscoring the need to preoperatively anticipate adverse postoperative outcomes given the procedure's expanding use. Our study aims to accomplish two goals: firstly, to develop a suite of explainable machine learning (ML) models capable of predicting adverse postoperative outcomes following ACDF surgery, and secondly, to embed these models in a user-friendly web application, demonstrating their potential utility.Methods We utilized data from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database to identify patients who underwent ACDF surgery. The outcomes of interest were four short-term postoperative adverse outcomes: prolonged length of stay (LOS), non-home discharges, 30-day readmissions, and major complications. We utilized five ML algorithms - TabPFN, TabNET, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Random Forest - coupled with the Optuna optimization library for hyperparameter tuning. To bolster the interpretability of our models, we employed SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) for evaluating predictor variables' relative importance and used partial dependence plots to illustrate the impact of individual variables on the predictions generated by our top-performing models. We visualized model performance using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and precision-recall curves (PRC). Quantitative metrics calculated were the area under the ROC curve (AUROC), balanced accuracy, weighted area under the PRC (AUPRC), weighted precision, and weighted recall. Models with the highest AUROC values were selected for inclusion in a web application.Results The analysis included 57,760 patients for prolonged LOS [11.1% with prolonged LOS], 57,780 for non-home discharges [3.3% non-home discharges], 57,790 for 30-day readmissions [2.9% readmitted], and 57,800 for major complications [1.4% with major complications]. The top-performing models, which were the ones built with the Random Forest algorithm, yielded mean AUROCs of 0.776, 0.846, 0.775, and 0.747 for predicting prolonged LOS, non-home discharges, readmissions, and complications, respectively.Conclusions Our study employs advanced ML methodologies to enhance the prediction of adverse postoperative outcomes following ACDF. We designed an accessible web application to integrate these models into clinical practice. Our findings affirm that ML tools serve as vital supplements in risk stratification, facilitating the prediction of diverse outcomes and enhancing patient counseling for ACDF.

AB  - Background: Low bone mineral density (LBMD), which includes osteopenia and osteoporosis, is associated with substantial health care costs. However, current diagnostic methods for LBMD are limited in terms of accuracy and accessibility. This study aims to develop an interpretable machine learning model for LBMD risk assessment and implement it as a web-based clinical decision support tool. Methods: Data from subjects who underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at the People's Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region were collected and randomly divided into a training set (70 %) and an internal validation set (30 %). An external validation set was sourced from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and multiple logistic regression were used for feature selection. Ten common machine learning models were conducted based on the selected features. Model performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), Brier score, and decision curve analysis (DCA). The decision mechanisms of the best-performing model were explained using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME). The optimal model was deployed as a web application using Streamlit. Results: A total of 16,274 participants were included in this study. Age, body mass index (BMI), alkaline phosphatase, and total cholesterol were identified as key predictors of LBMD. The logistic regression (LR) model demonstrated superior prediction performance (internal validation set [AUC = 0.902, MCC = 0.684, Brier score = 0.123], external validation set [0.812, 0.358, 0.265]). DCA confirmed its clinical utility. Both SHAP and LIME showed consistent results in identifying predictive factors. The LR model was deployed as a web application to predict LBMD. Conclusion: Our interpretable machine learning model and web-based implementation provide a free and reliable tool for predicting LBMD, which represents a significant advancement in making LBMD screening more accessible and cost-effective.

AB  - Introduction: Machine Learning (ML) is transforming medical research by enhancing diagnostic accuracy, predicting disease progression, and personalizing treatments. While general models trained on large datasets identify broad patterns across populations, the diversity of human biology, shaped by genetics, environment, and lifestyle, often limits their effectiveness. This has driven a shift towards subject-specific models that incorporate individual biological and clinical data for more precise predictions and personalized care. However, developing these models presents significant practical and financial challenges. Additionally, ML models initialized through stochastic processes with random seeds can suffer from reproducibility issues when those seeds are changed, leading to variations in predictive performance and feature importance. To address this, this study introduces a novel validation approach to enhance model interpretability, stabilizing predictive performance and feature importance at both the group and subject-specific levels. Methods: We conducted initial experiments using a single Random Forest (RF) model initialized with a random seed for key stochastic processes, on nine datasets that varied in domain problems, sample size, and demographics. Different validation techniques were applied to assess model accuracy and reproducibility while evaluating feature importance consistency. Next, the experiment was repeated for each dataset for up to 400 trials per subject, randomly seeding the machine learning algorithm between each trial. This introduced variability in the initialization of model parameters, thus providing a more comprehensive evaluation of the machine learning model's features and performance consistency. The repeated trials generated up to 400 feature sets per subject. By aggregating feature importance rankings across trials, our method identified the most consistently important features, reducing the impact of noise and random variation in feature selection. The top subject-specific feature importance set across all trials was then identified. Finally, using all subject-specific feature sets, the top group-specific feature importance set was also created. This process resulted in stable, reproducible feature rankings, enhancing both subject-level and group-level model explainability. Results: We found that machine learning models with stochastic initialization were particularly susceptible to variations in reproducibility, predictive accuracy, and feature importance due to random seed selection and validation techniques during training. Changes in random seeds altered weight initialization, optimization paths, and feature rankings, leading to fluctuations in test accuracy and interpretability. These findings align with prior research on the sensitivity of stochastic models to initialization randomness. This study builds on that understanding by introducing a novel repeated trials validation approach with random seed variation, significantly reducing variability in feature rankings and improving the consistency of model performance metrics. The method enabled robust identification of key features for each subject using a single, generic machine learning model, making predictions more interpretable and stable across experiments. Conclusion: Subject-specific models improve generalization by addressing variability in human biology but are often costly and impractical for clinical trials.
   In this study, we introduce a novel validation technique for determining both group-and subject-specific feature importance within a general machine learning model, achieving greater stability in feature selection, higher predictive accuracy, and improved model interpretability. Our proposed approach ensures reproducible accuracy metrics and reliable feature rankings when using models incorporating stochastic processes, making machine learning models more robust and clinically applicable.

AB  - With the invention of high-throughput screening technologies, innumerable drug sensitivity data for thousands of cancer cell lines and hundreds of compounds have been produced. Computational analysis of these data has opened a new horizon in the development of novel anti-cancer drugs. Previous deep-learning approaches to predict drug sensitivity showed drawbacks due to the casual integration of genomic features of cell lines and compound chemical features. The challenges addressed include the intricate interplay of diverse molecular features, interpretability of complex deep learning models, and the optimization of drug combinations for synergistic effects. Through the utilization of normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) and root mean squared error (RMSE) as evaluation metrics, the models aim to concurrently assess the ranking quality of recommended drugs and the accuracy of predicted drug responses. The integration of the DRPO model into cancer drug response prediction not only tackles these challenges but also holds promise in facilitating more effective, personalized, and targeted cancer therapies. This paper proposes a new deep learning model, DRPO , for efficient integration of genomic and compound features in predicting the half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50). First, matrix factorization is used to map the drug and cell line into latent 'pharmacogenomic' space with cell line-specific predicted drug responses. Using these drug responses, we next obtained the essential drugs using a Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) score. Finally, the essential drugs and genomic features are integrated to predict drug sensitivity using a deep model. Experimental results with RMSE 0.39 and NDCG 0.98 scores on Genomics of drug sensitivity in cancer (GDSC1) datasets show that our proposed approach has outperformed the previous approaches, including DeepDSC, CaDRRes, and KMBF. These good results show great potential to use our new model to discover novel anti-cancer drugs for precision medicine.

AB  - Incorporating deep learning into computer-aided medical diagnosis has led to significant advancements. However, a major challenge remains in interpreting deep learning models, especially in identifying the features critical for diagnosis. This study proposes a method for the early detection of colorectal cancer. The method uses the dyadic wavelet packet transform, root mean square, and zero count metrics to extract meaningful features from endoscopic images. These features effectively capture variations in pixel values and delineate contours and patterns. A standout strength of the proposed method lies in its interpretability. The direct feature extraction process enhances both the method's transparency and the classification results' comprehensibility. Furthermore, by analyzing the mean absolute values of principal component scores, we provide insightful explanations for misclassification cases, offering a deeper understanding of the classification mechanics. We experimentally evaluated the performance of the proposed method against five deep learning models on three diverse datasets. The results showed that our method achieved a validation accuracy of 99.2% on the Saga University Hospital dataset, 97.4% on the Kvasir-SEG dataset, and 97.8% on the CVC-ClinicDB dataset. These scores surpassed all other models tested, with precision, recall, and F1-measure values consistently higher across datasets, highlighting the method's robustness and potential for reliable early colorectal cancer detection.

AB  - The increasing usage of machine-learning models in critical domains has recently stressed the necessity of interpretable machine-learning models. In areas like healthcare, finary - the model consumer must understand the rationale behind the model output in order to use it when making a decision. For this reason, it is impossible to use black-box models in these scenarios, regardless of their high predictive performance. Decision forests, and in particular Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT), are examples of this kind of model. GBDT models are considered the state-of-the-art in many classification challenges, reflected by the fact that the majority of Kaggle's recent winners used GBDT methods as a part of their solution (such as XGBoost). But despite their superior predictive perfor-mance, they cannot be used in tasks that require transparency. This paper presents a novel method for transforming a decision forest of any kind into an interpretable decision tree. The method extends the tool-set available for machine learning practitioners, who want to exploit the interpretability of decision trees without significantly impairing the predic-tive performance gained by GBDT models like XGBoost. We show in an empirical evalua-tion that in some cases the generated tree is able to approximate the predictive performance of a XGBoost model while enabling better transparency of the outputs.

AB  - Problem definition: : Artificial intelligence (AI) assistants-software agents that can perform tasks or services for individuals-are among the most promising AI applications. However, little is known about the adoption of AI assistants by service providers (i.e., physicians) in a real-world healthcare setting. In this paper, we investigate the impact of the AI smartness (i.e., whether the AI assistant is powered by machine learning intelligence) and the impact of AI transparency (i.e., whether physicians are informed of the AI assistant). Methodology/results: : We collaborate with a leading healthcare platform to run a field experiment in which we compare physicians' adoption behavior, that is, adoption rate and adoption timing, of smart and automated AI assistants under transparent and non-transparent conditions. We find that the smartness can increase the adoption rate and shorten the adoption timing, whereas the transparency can only shorten the adoption timing. Moreover, the impact of AI transparency on the adoption rate is contingent on the smartness level of the AI assistant: the transparency increases the adoption rate only when the AI assistant is not equipped with smart algorithms and fails to do so when the AI assistant is smart. Managerial implications: : Our study can guide platforms in designing their AI strategies. Platforms should improve the smartness of AI assistants. If such an improvement is too costly, the platform should transparentize the AI assistant, especially when it is not smart.

AB  - Adverse drug reactions are a common cause of morbidity in health care. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) evaluates individual case safety reports of adverse events (AEs) after submission to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System as part of its surveillance activities. Over the past decade, the FDA has explored the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to evaluate these reports to improve the efficiency and scientific rigor of the process. However, a gap remains between AI algorithm development and deployment. This viewpoint aims to describe the lessons learned from our experience and research needed to address both general issues in case-based reasoning using AI and specific needs for individual case safety report assessment. Beginning with the recognition that the trustworthiness of the AI algorithm is the main determinant of its acceptance by human experts, we apply the Diffusion of Innovations theory to help explain why certain algorithms for evaluating AEs at the FDA were accepted by safety reviewers and others were not. This analysis reveals that the process by which clinicians decide from case reports whether a drug is likely to cause an AE is not well defined beyond general principles. This makes the development of high performing, transparent, and explainable AI algorithms challenging, leading to a lack of trust by the safety reviewers. Even accounting for the introduction of large language models, the pharmacovigilance community needs an improved understanding of causal inference and of the cognitive framework for determining the causal relationship between a drug and an AE. We describe specific future research directions that underpin facilitating implementation and trust in AI for drug safety applications, including improved methods for measuring and controlling of algorithmic uncertainty, computational reproducibility, and clear articulation of a cognitive framework for causal inference in case-based reasoning.

AB  - Introduction: The use of Artificial intelligence in drug discovery is changing the field of Medicine across the world today positively. In this review, the role of AI in each focus area for the improvement of the drug development process, and its relevance in translational medicine is discussed. Materials and Method: A systematic review was conducted by searching databases such as PubMed and Scopus, employing key terms like "AI" "drug discovery" "machine learning" "clinical trials" and "translational medicine." Inclusion criteria focused on peer-reviewed studies published between 2014 and 2024 that specifically addressed the role of AI in drug development. Data extraction involved categorizing findings based on different phases of drug discovery. Results: The findings reveal that the use of AI lowers costs, shortens the time required for drug development, and enhances the predictive capability. AI technologies play an essential role in molecular modeling, drug design and screening, and the efficient design of clinical trials. However, some of the issues that remain include the quality of available data, issues of interpretability of the models, and the more critical issue of ethical considerations that need collective efforts on the development of associate regulatory policies. Conclusion: AI holds immense potential to dramatically change and transform the process of drug discovery and translational medicine while promoting accurate prevention and cures. However, it is also important to understand how to work with existing problems to make the best use of AI in healthcare. The roles of AI technologies are likely to grow in the development of the medical future, provide patients with better results, and stimulate the innovations in the field of the drug creation.

AB  - Skin lesion segmentation plays a crucial role in the computer-aided diagnosis of melanoma. Deep Learning models have shown promise in accurately segmenting skin lesions, but their widespread adoption in real-life clinical settings is hindered by their inherent black-box nature. In domains as critical as healthcare, interpretability is not merely a feature but a fundamental requirement for model adoption. This paper proposes IARS SegNet an advanced segmentation framework built upon the SegNet baseline model. Our approach incorporates three critical components: Skip connections, residual convolutions, and a global attention mechanism onto the baseline Segnet architecture. These elements play a pivotal role in accentuating the significance of clinically relevant regions, particularly the contours of skin lesions. The inclusion of skip connections enhances the model's capacity to learn intricate contour details, while the use of residual convolutions allows for the construction of a deeper model while preserving essential image features. The global attention mechanism further contributes by extracting refined feature maps from each convolutional and deconvolutional block, thereby elevating the model's interpretability. This enhancement highlights critical regions, fosters better understanding, and leads to more accurate skin lesion segmentation for melanoma diagnosis. This study primarily focuses on the interpretation of performance improvements in the base model resulting from the integration of each of these three components. To comprehensively assess the performance gain achieved with each addition, we employ two sets of evaluation metrics, quantifying performance based on both regions and contours. The results underscore the superior segmentation capabilities of the proposed architecture compared to the SegNet and U-Net models. Notably, the model's performance gain due to each enhancement is visually interpretable.

AB  - This study presents systematic design guidelines for AI-powered clinical decision support systems (AI-CDSS) based on a comprehensive literature review and theme analysis. The proposed guidelines are divided into two parts, comprising 25 items: "How-design methods" and "What-design content and forms." The usability of these guidelines is demonstrated through an AI-CDSS design practice for stroke diagnosis and thrombolytic risk assessment in a Chinese clinical setting. The empirical case study provides practical suggestions for similar AI-CDSS designs that require fast decision-making. Challenges concerning system transparency or explainability and the impact of bias on system output are considered key issues in designing an effective and satisfying AI-CDSS. The potential usefulness of AI-CDSS in clinical decision-making scenarios has been indicated by numerous studies, with efficient design guidelines still needed to address these challenges.

AB  - Pregnancy complications in the early months of the family process can lead to miscarriage. Miscarriage does not occur due to only one reason; many factors are involved in causing miscarriage. Deep Learning (DL) can help healthcare providers by providing advanced analysis. In this study, we have proposed two novel ensemble models, Echo Dense Inception Blending (EDI-Blend) and Dense Reservoir Inception Modular Network (DRIM-Net), for miscarriage prediction. The dataset is balanced through the use of the hybrid balancing technique NearSMOTE. As the dataset is high-dimensional, we have used the Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator to select essential features from the dataset that significantly impact pregnancy complications. We validate the output of our proposed EDI-Blend and DRIM-Net models using 10-Fold Cross Validation. To determine the contribution of features for miscarriage prediction two eXplainable Artificial Intelligence techniques are applied to EDI-Blend and DRIM-Net: Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations and SHapley Additive exPlanations. We have compared our proposed EDI-Blend model with base models, and the results show that EDI-Blend model performance is more efficient, with 0.732 accuracy, 0.721 recall, 0.732 F1-score, and 0.721 Receiver Operating Characteristic-Area Under the Curve (ROC-AUC). The DRIM-Net model is also compared with baseline models and achieves 0.768 F1-score, 0.764 precision, 0.769 accuracy, 0.769 recall, and 0.837 ROC-AUC.

AB  - In healthcare, especially within intensive care units (ICU), informed decision-making by medical professionals is crucial due to the complexity of medical data. Healthcare analytics seeks to support these decisions by generating accurate predictions through advanced machine learning (ML) models, such as boosted decision trees and random forests. While these models frequently exhibit accurate predictions across various medical tasks, they often lack interpretability. To address this challenge, researchers have developed interpretable ML models that balance accuracy and interpretability. In this study, we evaluate the performance gap between interpretable and black-box models in two healthcare prediction tasks, mortality and length-of-stay prediction in ICU settings. We focus specifically on the family of generalized additive models (GAMs) as powerful interpretable ML models. Our assessment uses the publicly available Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care dataset, and we analyze the models based on (i) predictive performance, (ii) the influence of compact feature sets (i.e., only few features) on predictive performance, and (iii) interpretability and consistency with medical knowledge. Our results show that interpretable models achieve competitive performance, with a minor decrease of 0.2-0.9 percentage points in area under the receiver operating characteristic relative to state-of-the-art black-box models, while preserving complete interpretability. This remains true even for parsimonious models that use only 2.2 % of patient features. Our study highlights the potential of interpretable models to improve decision-making in ICUs by providing medical professionals with easily understandable and verifiable predictions.

AB  - Retinal artery occlusion (RAO) is a sight-threatening condition that requires prompt diagnosis to prevent irreversible vision loss. This study presents an innovative AI-driven approach for RAO detection from fundus images, marking the first application of deep learning for this purpose. Using a self-supervised learning (SSL) framework with SimCLR, our model addresses the challenge of limited labeled RAO data. The ResNet50 model pretrained with SimCLR demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy, achieving areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.924 and 0.988 on two external validation datasets, highlighting its robustness and generalizability in RAO detection. To enhance transparency in clinical AI, we incorporated a multimodal interpretability approach using a ChatGPT-4-based AI chatbot. This chatbot, combined with Grad-CAM visualizations, provides detailed clinical explanations of the model's predictions, emphasizing key RAO features such as retinal whitening and cherry-red spots. This multimodal interpretability framework improves clinicians' understanding of the model's decision-making process, facilitating clinical adoption and trust. By automating RAO detection, this AI model serves as a valuable tool for the early identification of ocular and systemic vascular risks, enabling timely intervention. These findings highlight the potential of fundus imaging for RAO detection and broader cardiovascular risk assessment, advancing AI's role in predictive healthcare.

AB  - Objective Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a significant global health threat, responsible for severe liver diseases such as liver failure, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The burden is especially high in low-income regions, where early diagnosis and treatment are critical for mitigating its impact. This study investigates the effectiveness of various machine learning (ML) techniques in predicting patient outcomes in HBV infection.Methods The Chi-squared test was used for feature selection to find the most important factors, which were later applied to train and evaluate various ML models. To address the class imbalance in the dataset, the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) was used to balance the data. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) were used to improve the models' interpretability.Results Among individual models, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression (LR) each achieved an accuracy of 92.5%. By implementing a Voting Classifier that combined SVM and LR, the overall accuracy was improved to 95%. The results showed that higher levels of some risk factors, especially in older patients, greatly raise the risk of death.Conclusion These insights provide healthcare professionals and policymakers with valuable information to develop predicting better patient outcomes in HBV infection and patient care strategies.

AB  - The implementation of cancer precision medicine requires biomarkers or signatures for predicting prognosis and therapeutic benefits. Most of current efforts in this field are paying much more attention to predictive accuracy than to molecular mechanistic interpretability. Mechanism-driven strategy has recently emerged, aiming to build signatures with both predictive power and explanatory power. Driven by this strategy, we developed a robust gene dysregulation analysis framework with machine learning algorithms, which is capable of exploring gene dysregulations underlying carcinogenesis from high-dimensional data with cooperativity and synergy between regulators and several other transcriptional regulation rules taken into consideration. We then applied the framework to a colorectal cancer (CRC) cohort from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The identified CRC-related dysregulations significantly covered known carcinogenic processes and exhibited good prognostic effect. By choosing dysregulations with greedy strategy, we built a four-dysregulation (4-DysReg) signature, which has the capability of predicting prognosis and adjuvant chemotherapy benefit. 4-DysReg has the potential to explain carcinogenesis in terms of dysfunctional transcriptional regulation. These results demonstrate that our gene dysregulation analysis framework could be used to develop predictive signature with mechanistic interpretability for cancer precision medicine, and furthermore, elucidate the mechanisms of carcinogenesis.

AB  - Background Polypharmacy is common among older adults and it represents a public health concern, due to the negative health impacts potentially associated with the use of several medications. However, the large number of medication combinations and sequences of use makes it complicated for traditional statistical methods to predict which therapy is genuinely associated with health outcomes. The project aims to use artificial intelligence (AI) to determine the quality of polypharmacy among older adults with chronic diseases in the province of Quebec, Canada. Methods We will use data from the Quebec Integrated Chronic Disease Surveillance System (QICDSS). QICDSS contains information about prescribed medications in older adults in Quebec collected over 20 years. It also includes diagnostic codes and procedures, and sociodemographic data linked through a unique identification number for each individual. Our research will be structured around three interconnected research axes: AI, Health, and Law&Ethics. The AI research axis will develop algorithms for finding frequent patterns of medication use that correlate with health events, considering data locality and temporality (explainable AI or XAI). The Health research axis will translate these patterns into polypharmacy indicators relevant to public health surveillance and clinicians. The Law&Ethics axis will assess the social acceptability of the algorithms developed using AI tools and the indicators developed by the Heath axis and will ensure that the developed indicators neither discriminate against any population group nor increase the disparities already present in the use of medications. Discussion The multi-disciplinary research team consists of specialists in AI, health data, statistics, pharmacy, public health, law, and ethics, which will allow investigation of polypharmacy from different points of view and will contribute to a deeper understanding of the clinical, social, and ethical issues surrounding polypharmacy and its surveillance, as well as the use of AI for health record data. The project results will be disseminated to the scientific community, healthcare professionals, and public health decision-makers in peer-reviewed publications, scientific meetings, and reports. The diffusion of the results will ensure the confidentiality of individual data.

AB  - AI holds the potential to transform healthcare, promising improvements in patient care. Yet, realizing this potential is hampered by over-reliance on limited datasets and a lack of transparency in validation processes. To overcome these obstacles, we advocate the creation of a detailed registry for AI algorithms. This registry would document the development, training, and validation of AI models, ensuring scientific integrity and transparency. Additionally, it would serve as a platform for peer review and ethical oversight. By bridging the gap between scientific validation and regulatory approval, such as by the FDA, we aim to enhance the integrity and trustworthiness of AI applications in healthcare.

AB  - The spread of machine learning models, coupled with by the growing adoption of electronic health records (EHRs), has opened the door for developing clinical decision support systems. However, despite the great promise of machine learning for healthcare in low-middle-income countries (LMICs), many data-specific limitations, such as the small size and irregular sampling, hinder the progress in such applications. Recently, deep generative models have been proposed to generate realistic-looking synthetic data, including EHRs, by learning the underlying data distribution without compromising patient privacy. In this study, we first use a deep generative model to generate synthetic data based on a small dataset (364 patients) from a LMIC setting. Next, we use synthetic data to build models that predict the onset of hospital-acquired infections based on minimal information collected at patient ICU admission. The performance of the diagnostic model trained on the synthetic data outperformed models trained on the original and oversampled data using techniques such as SMOTE. We also experiment with varying the size of the synthetic data and observe the impact on the performance and interpretability of the models. Our results show the promise of using deep generative models in enabling healthcare data owners to develop and validate models that serve their needs and applications, despite limitations in dataset size.

AB  - In this paper, we propose an SIRD model that incorporates the Crowley-Martin-type incidence rate and Holling type-II treatment rate, providing a more realistic representation of how contact limitations and healthcare capacity affect disease transmission compared to traditional bilinear models. We establish the existence, positivity, and boundedness of the model solutions to ensure well-posedness. The basic reproduction number $ \mathcal {R}_0 $ R0 is computed using the next-generation matrix. We also examine the local and global stability of the proposed model. To estimate unknown parameters, we employ the epi-DNN method, which combines epidemiological knowledge with deep learning. Subsequently, we train machine learning models on the output of the compartmental model and compare their forecasts with real data. This two-step approach improves interpretability and combines a biology-driven model with advanced learning techniques, resulting in a robust and adaptable framework for modelling and forecasting real-world epidemic dynamics.

AB  - Hepatitis C is a significant public health concern, resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide. Early diagnosis and effective treatment are essential to prevent the disease's progression to chronic liver disease. Machine learning algorithms have been increasingly used to develop predictive models for various diseases, including hepatitis C. This study aims to evaluate the performance of several machine learning algorithms in diagnosing chronic liver disease, with a specific focus on hepatitis C, to improve the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of the diagnostic process. We collected a comprehensive dataset of 1801 patient records, each with 12 distinct features, from Jordan University Hospital. To assess the robustness and dependability of our proposed framework, we conducted two research scenarios, one with feature selection and one without. We also employed the Sequential Forward Selection (SFS) method to identify the most relevant features that can enhance the model's accuracy. Moreover, we investigated the effect of the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) on the accuracy of the model's predictions. Our findings indicate that all machine learning models achieved an average accuracy of 83% when applied to the dataset. Furthermore, the use of SMOTE did not significantly affect the accuracy of the model's predictions. Despite the increasing use of machine learning models in medical diagnosis, there is a growing concern about their interpretability. As such, we addressed this issue by utilizing the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) method to explain the predictions of our machine learning model, which was specifically developed for hepatitis C prediction in Jordan. This work provides a comprehensive evaluation of various machine learning algorithms in diagnosing chronic liver disease, with a particular emphasis on hepatitis C. The results provide valuable insights into the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of the diagnostic process and highlight the importance of interpretability in medical diagnosis.

AB  - Purpose Chatbots with artificial intelligence are now increasingly being used in various areas of healthcare, raising the question of whether and how they could be put to good use in addiction counseling. The aim of this article is to examine the opportunities and challenges of using chatbots based on artificial intelligence in this care segment, based on the opinions of experts in artificial intelligence.Methods Artificial intelligence experts were surveyed using a semi-structured interview. The transcripts were analyzed using content-structuring qualitative content analysis.Results The use of chatbots based on artificial intelligence could relieve the burden on addiction counselors and thus create more capacity for supporting people in crisis situations. However, the ability of chatbots with artificial intelligence to adequately detect emotional signals in addicted people is currently being questioned. It is predicted that chatbots based on artificial intelligence will support, but not replace, addiction counseling.Conclusion This support could improve psychosocial care for addicted people. A trialogic exchange between users, end users and providers should help to ensure the quality of such chatbots and promote understanding and transparency.

AB  - BackgroundMultivariate longitudinal data are under-utilized for survival analysis compared to cross-sectional data (CS - data collected once across cohort). Particularly in cardiovascular risk prediction, despite available methods of longitudinal data analysis, the value of longitudinal information has not been established in terms of improved predictive accuracy and clinical applicability.MethodsWe investigated the value of longitudinal data over and above the use of cross-sectional data via 6 distinct modeling strategies from statistics, machine learning, and deep learning that incorporate repeated measures for survival analysis of the time-to-cardiovascular event in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) cohort. We then examined and compared the use of model-specific interpretability methods (Random Survival Forest Variable Importance) and model-agnostic methods (SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) and Temporal Importance Model Explanation (TIME)) in cardiovascular risk prediction using the top-performing models.ResultsIn a cohort of 3539 participants, longitudinal information from 35 variables that were repeatedly collected in 6 exam visits over 15 years improved subsequent long-term (17 years after) risk prediction by up to 8.3% in C-index compared to using baseline data (0.78 vs. 0.72), and up to approximately 4% compared to using the last observed CS data (0.75). Time-varying AUC was also higher in models using longitudinal data (0.86-0.87 at 5 years, 0.79-0.81 at 10 years) than using baseline or last observed CS data (0.80-0.86 at 5 years, 0.73-0.77 at 10 years). Comparative model interpretability analysis revealed the impact of longitudinal variables on model prediction on both the individual and global scales among different modeling strategies, as well as identifying the best time windows and best timing within that window for event prediction. The best strategy to incorporate longitudinal data for accuracy was time series massive feature extraction, and the easiest interpretable strategy was trajectory clustering.ConclusionOur analysis demonstrates the added value of longitudinal data in predictive accuracy and epidemiological utility in cardiovascular risk survival analysis in young adults via a unified, scalable framework that compares model performance and explainability. The framework can be extended to a larger number of variables and other longitudinal modeling methods.

AB  - We propose a personalized algorithmic decision support (PADS) tool, facilitating premium pricing for pregnant women by accounting for the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The insurance premium with PADS is derived from true negative and positive ratios of machine learning algorithms. Hybrid sampling with uniform designs improves ML algorithm performance under unbalanced data. Feature selection approaches guarantee the accuracy and interpretability of the prediction models. PADS reduces the premium for most patients with a lower risk of GDM. A smaller fraction of patients will pay more premiums under PADS; however, they can benefit from an earlier GDM diagnosis.

AB  - A medical field that is increasingly benefiting from Artificial Intelligence applications is Gyne- cology and Obstetrics. In previous work, we exposed that Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology and obstetric control by physicians can enhance pregnancy health, leading to better pregnancy outcomes and overall better experience, also reducing any possible long-term effects that can be produced by complications. This work presents a data collection methodology for responsible AI in Health and a case study in the pregnancy domain. It is a qualitative descriptive study on the preferences and expectations expressed by pregnant women regarding responsible AI and affective computing. A 41-items structured interview was distributed among 150 pregnant pa- tients attending prenatal care at Hospital Virgen del Rocio and the Clinic Victoria Rey (Seville, Spain) during the months of October and November 2020. A substantial interest in intelligent pregnancy solutions among pregnant women has been revealed in this study. Participants with a lower level of interest reported privacy concerns and lack of trust towards AI solutions. Re- garding affective computing based intelligent solutions specifically, most participants reported positively and no significant difference was found between women having a healthy or a high risk pregnancy on this matter. Our findings also suggest that a high demand of personalized intelligent solutions exists among participants. On the topic of sharing pregnancy data with the healthcare provider in favor of scientific research, pregnant women assisting public health- care services were found to be more likely to share their data when the provider was a public healthcare system rather than a private entity. Pregnant women who are interested in using an AI pregnancy application share a strong idea that it needs to be responsible, trustworthy, useful, and safe. Likewise, we found that pregnant women would change their mind about their concerns and they would feel more confident if the intelligent solution gives explanations about the system decisions and recommendations, as XAI approach promotes.

AB  - The role of artificial intelligence (AI) in oncology decision-making is rapidly expanding, yet its concordance with clinician recommendations and established guidelines remains unclear. This study evaluates the agreement between AI-generated adjuvant therapy recommendations for stage II colon cancer, clinician decisions, and international guidelines (NCCN, ESMO). We conducted a retrospective comparative analysis of 197 stage II colon cancer patients treated at Hacettepe University between 2014 and 2023. AI-generated recommendations (ChatGPT-4o) were compared with clinician decisions and NCCN/ESMO guidelines. Concordance rates were analyzed using Cohen's kappa and McNemar's test. Clinician adherence was highest with NCCN (89.8%) and ESMO (84.8%) guidelines. AI recommendations showed moderate agreement with clinician decisions (65.0%, kappa= 0.47). Statistically significant differences were observed between AI and clinical practice (p< 0.001), suggesting AI's more conservative approach. While AI demonstrates potential as a clinical decision-support tool, its moderate alignment with real-world decisions highlights the need for further refinement. Future improvements in AI interpretability, real-world validation, and clinician-AI collaboration are essential for its effective integration into oncology practice.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly being used in medicine due to its advanced capabilities in image and video recognition, clinical decision support, surgical education, and administrative task automation. Large language models such as OpenAI's Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT)-4 and Google's Bard have particularly revolutionized text generation, offering substantial benefits for the academic surgeon, including aiding in manuscript and grant writing. However, integrating AI into academic surgery necessitates addressing ethical concerns such as bias, transparency, and intellectual property. This paper provides guidelines and recommendations based on current literature around the opportunities and ethical challenges of AI in academic surgery. We discuss the underlying mechanisms of large language models, their potential biases, and the importance of responsible usage. Furthermore, we explore the ethical implications of AI in clinical documentation, highlighting improved efficiency and necessary privacy concerns. This review also addresses the critical issue of intellectual property dilemmas posed by AI-generated innovations in university settings. Finally, we propose guidelines for the responsible adoption of AI in academic and clinical environments, stressing the need for transparency, ethical training,and robust governance frameworks to ensure AI enhances, rather than undermines, academic integrity and patient care.

AB  - This study aimed to analyze feature importance by applying explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to postural deformity parameters extracted from a computer vision-based posture analysis system (CVPAS). Overall, 140 participants were screened for CVPAS and enrolled. The main data analyzed were shoulder height difference (SHD), wrist height difference (WHD), and pelvic height difference (PHD) extracted using a CVPAS. Standing X-ray imaging and radiographic assessments were performed. Predictive modeling was implemented with XGBoost, random forest regressor, and logistic regression using XAI techniques for global and local feature analyses. Correlation analysis was performed between radiographic assessment and AI evaluation for PHD, SHD, and Cobb angle. Main global features affecting scoliosis were analyzed in the order of importance for PHD (0.18) and ankle height difference (0.06) in predictive modeling. Outstanding local features were PHD, WHD, and KHD that predominantly contributed to the increase in the probability of scoliosis, and the prediction probability of scoliosis was 94%. When the PHD was >3 mm, the probability of scoliosis increased sharply to 85.3%. The paired t-test result for AI and radiographic assessments showed that the SHD, Cobb angle, and scoliosis probability were significant (p < 0.05). Feature importance analysis using XAI to postural deformity parameters extracted from a CVPAS is a useful clinical decision support system for the early detection of posture deformities. PHD was a major parameter for both global and local analyses, and 3 mm was a threshold for significantly increasing the probability of local interpretation of each participant and the prediction of postural deformation, which leads to the prediction of participant-specific scoliosis.

AB  - BackgroundArtificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used for prevention, diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Despite the potential for AI to improve care, ethical concerns and mistrust in AI-enabled healthcare exist among the public and medical community. Given the rapid and transformative recent growth of AI in cardiovascular care, to inform practice guidelines and regulatory policies that facilitate ethical and trustworthy use of AI in medicine, we conducted a literature review to identify key ethical and trust barriers and facilitators from patients' and healthcare providers' perspectives when using AI in cardiovascular care.MethodsIn this rapid literature review, we searched six bibliographic databases to identify publications discussing transparency, trust, or ethical concerns (outcomes of interest) associated with AI-based medical devices (interventions of interest) in the context of cardiovascular care from patients', caregivers', or healthcare providers' perspectives. The search was completed on May 24, 2022 and was not limited by date or study design.ResultsAfter reviewing 7,925 papers from six databases and 3,603 papers identified through citation chasing, 145 articles were included. Key ethical concerns included privacy, security, or confidentiality issues (n = 59, 40.7%); risk of healthcare inequity or disparity (n = 36, 24.8%); risk of patient harm (n = 24, 16.6%); accountability and responsibility concerns (n = 19, 13.1%); problematic informed consent and potential loss of patient autonomy (n = 17, 11.7%); and issues related to data ownership (n = 11, 7.6%). Major trust barriers included data privacy and security concerns, potential risk of patient harm, perceived lack of transparency about AI-enabled medical devices, concerns about AI replacing human aspects of care, concerns about prioritizing profits over patients' interests, and lack of robust evidence related to the accuracy and limitations of AI-based medical devices. Ethical and trust facilitators included ensuring data privacy and data validation, conducting clinical trials in diverse cohorts, providing appropriate training and resources to patients and healthcare providers and improving their engagement in different phases of AI implementation, and establishing further regulatory oversights.ConclusionThis review revealed key ethical concerns and barriers and facilitators of trust in AI-enabled medical devices from patients' and healthcare providers' perspectives. Successful integration of AI into cardiovascular care necessitates implementation of mitigation strategies. These strategies should focus on enhanced regulatory oversight on the use of patient data and promoting transparency around the use of AI in patient care.

AB  - One of the primary difficulties in treating patients with genetic syndromes is diagnosing their condition. Many syndromes are associated with characteristic facial features that can be imaged and utilized by computer-assisted diagnosis systems. In this work, we develop a novel 3D facial surface modeling approach with the objective of maximizing diagnostic model interpretability within a flexible deep learning framework. Therefore, an invertible normalizing flow architecture is introduced to enable both inferential and generative tasks in a unified and efficient manner. The proposed model can be used (1) to infer syndrome diagnosis and other demographic variables given a 3D facial surface scan and (2) to explain model inferences to non-technical users via multiple interpretability mechanisms. The model was trained and evaluated on more than 4700 facial surface scans from subjects with 47 different syndromes. For the challenging task of predicting syndrome diagnosis given a new 3D facial surface scan, age, and sex of a subject, the model achieves a competitive overall top-1 accuracy of 71%, and a mean sensitivity of 43% across all syndrome classes. We believe that invertible models such as the one presented in this work can achieve competitive inferential performance while greatly increasing model interpretability in the domain of medical diagnosis.

AB  - The complexity and high dimensionality of healthcare data present substantial challenges in building machine learning (ML) models, given the large number of variables such as patient demographics and medical history. Effective feature selection is crucial to address issues such as increased computational resource, longer training times, overfitting, and reduced model interpretability, etc. This study evaluates a range of feature selection methods to identify the most impactful features for predicting dental expenditures using publicly available Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) data. Sixteen ML models are assessed to determine the top performing model, after which state-of-the-art filter, wrapper, embedded, and hybrid feature selection techniques are applied to optimize the feature set. The highest performance, in terms of coefficient of determination (R-2), is achieved using a hybrid feature selection method that combines the mutual information filter with the embedded features from the CatBoost regressor. The results indicate that the proposed system is suitable for real-time deployment even with reduced features, providing potential benefits such as minimizing the need for irrelevant and difficult-to-obtain features. Moreover, automated feature selection significantly enhances model performance, yielding a R-2 score of 0.86, compared to the score 0.73 achieved with carefully selected manual features. Additionally, to enhance the interpretability of the top-performing ML model, explanatory visualizations are employed to examine the influence of key features on predicting dental expenditures.

AB  - Early prediction of unfavorable outcome after ischemic stroke is significant for clinical management. Machine learning as a novel computational modeling technique could help clinicians to address the challenge. We aim to investigate the applicability of machine learning models for individualized prediction in ischemic stroke patients and demonstrate the utility of various model-agnostic explanation techniques for machine learning predictions. A total of 499 consecutive patients with Unfavorable [modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 3-6, n = 140] and favorable (mRS score 0-2, n = 359) outcome after 6-month from ischemic stroke were enrolled in this study. Four machine learning models, including Random Forest [RF], eXtreme Gradient Boosting [XGBoost], Adaptive Boosting [Adaboost] and Support Vector Machine [SVM] were performed with the area-under-the-curve (AUC): (90.20 +/- 0.22)%, (86.91 +/- 1.05)%, (86.49 +/- 2.35)%, (81.89 +/- 2.40)%, respectively. Three global interpretability techniques (Feature Importance shows the contribution of selected features, Partial Dependence Plot aims to visualize the average effect of a feature on the predicted probability of unfavorable outcome, Feature Interaction detects the change in the prediction that occurs by varying the features after considering the individual feature effects) and one local interpretability technique (Shapley Value indicates the probability of unfavorable outcome of different instances) have been applied to present the interpretability techniques via visualization. Thereby, the current study is important for better understanding intelligible healthcare analytics via explanations for the prediction of local and global levels, and potentially reduction of the mortality of patients with ischemic stroke by assisting clinicians in the decision-making process.

AB  - In the past decade, trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a focus for the AI community to ensure better adoption of AI models, and explainable AI is a cornerstone in this area. Over the years, the focus has shifted from building transparent AI methods to making recommendations on how to make black-box or opaque machine learning models and their results more understandable by experts and non-expert users. In our previous work, to address the goal of supporting user-centered explanations that make model recommendations more explainable, we developed an Explanation Ontology (EO). The EO is a general-purpose representation that was designed to help system designers connect explanations to their underlying data and knowledge. This paper addresses the apparent need for improved interoperability to support a wider range of use cases. We expand the EO, mainly in the system attributes contributing to explanations, by introducing new classes and properties to support a broader range of state-of-the-art explainer models. We present the expanded ontology model, highlighting the classes and properties that are important to model a larger set of fifteen literature-backed explanation types that are supported within the expanded EO. We build on these explanation type descriptions to show how to utilize the EO model to represent explanations in five use cases spanning the domains of finance, food, and healthcare. We include competency questions that evaluate the EO's capabilities to provide guidance for system designers on how to apply our ontology to their own use cases. This guidance includes allowing system designers to query the EO directly and providing them exemplar queries to explore content in the EO represented use cases. We have released this significantly expanded version of the Explanation Ontology at https://purl.org/heals/eo and updated our resource website, https://tetherless-world.github.io/explanation-ontology, with supporting documentation. Overall, through the EO model, we aim to help system designers be better informed about explanations and support these explanations that can be composed, given their systems' outputs from various AI models, including a mix of machine learning, logical and explainer models, and different types of data and knowledge available to their systems.

AB  - Background The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine has prompted the development of numerous ethical guidelines, while the involvement of patients in the creation of these documents lags behind. As part of the European PROFID project we explore patient perspectives on the ethical implications of AI in care for patients at increased risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD).Aim Explore perspectives of patients on the ethical use of AI, particularly in clinical decision-making regarding the implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).Methods Semi-structured, future scenario-based interviews were conducted among patients who had either an ICD and/or a heart condition with increased risk of SCD in Germany (n = 9) and the Netherlands (n = 15). We used the principles of the European Commission's Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI to structure the interviews.Results Six themes arose from the interviews: the ability of AI to rectify human doctors' limitations; the objectivity of data; whether AI can serve as second opinion; AI explainability and patient trust; the importance of the 'human touch'; and the personalization of care. Overall, our results reveal a strong desire among patients for more personalized and patient-centered care in the context of ICD implantation. Participants in our study express significant concerns about the further loss of the 'human touch' in healthcare when AI is introduced in clinical settings. They believe that this aspect of care is currently inadequately recognized in clinical practice. Participants attribute to doctors the responsibility of evaluating AI recommendations for clinical relevance and aligning them with patients' individual contexts and values, in consultation with the patient.Conclusion The 'human touch' patients exclusively ascribe to human medical practitioners extends beyond sympathy and kindness, and has clinical relevance in medical decision-making. Because this cannot be replaced by AI, we suggest that normative research into the 'right to a human doctor' is needed. Furthermore, policies on patient-centered AI integration in clinical practice should encompass the ethics of everyday practice rather than only principle-based ethics. We suggest that an empirical ethics approach grounded in ethnographic research is exceptionally well-suited to pave the way forward.

AB  - The early detection and accurate prediction of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are critical to reduce global severe morbidity and mortality. Machine learning (ML) methods, operated by Transformers have proved its efficiency in interpreting complex data interactions. One prime example would be its notable success in Natural Language Processing (NLP), with its multi-headed self-attention mechanism to disentangle the complex interactions within high-dimensional spaces. However, the relationships between various features within biological systems remain ambiguous in these spaces, making it difficult to apply transformers in clinical datasets. We introduce CardioTabNet, a transformer-driven framework designed precisely for clinical cardiovascular data. It leverages the strength of the tab transformer architecture to effectively extract meaningful insights from clinical data. As a result, downstream classical models' performance significantly showed outstanding results. We utilized an open-source cardiovascular dataset with 1190 instances and 11 features. These features are categorized into numerical (age, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, maximum heart rate, old peak, weight, and fasting blood sugar) and categorical (resting Electrocardiograms, exercise angina, and ST slope) variables. Tab transformer was used to extract significant features and rank them using a Random Forest (RF) feature ranking algorithm which highlighted the important clinical predictors. We used ten classical machine-learning models trained on these transformer extracted-features. An optimized ExtraTree classifier achieved an average accuracy of 94.1% and area under curve (AUC) of 95%. Furthermore, we performed nomogram analysis to draw out cardiovascular risk assessment to demonstrate clinical interpretability. Benchmarking against state-of-the-art methodologies affirmed the superior predictive capability of our CardioTabNet framework, demonstrating its potential as a robust tool for clinical decision support in cardiovascular disease prediction and early detection. In addition, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis was carried out to provide insights into feature contributions and enhance model interpretability.

AB  - BackgroundMacular edema is a vision-threatening complication of diabetic retinopathy that requires early detection and intervention to prevent severe visual impairment. Conventional diagnosis relies heavily on the expertise of ophthalmologists, which may be resource-intensive and time-consuming, particularly in large-scale screening scenarios. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers an opportunity to enhance efficiency and accuracy in such diagnostic processes.ObjectiveThis study aims to develop and evaluate an Enhanced Multi-feature Fusion Network (MFFN) for the automated detection and grading of diabetic macular edema (DME) from fundus images, supporting ophthalmologists in timely and accurate decision-making.MethodsWe utilized fundus images from diabetic retinopathy patients as the primary dataset to design a deep learning-based MFFN model for detecting hard exudates and classifying DME severity. The model integrates multi-feature fusion to capture spatial and contextual cues, while Grad-CAM visualization was employed to enhance interpretability and transparency in AI predictions. Performance was evaluated on benchmark datasets and in real-world clinical settings.ResultsThe proposed MFFN achieved an accuracy of 99.8% for DME detection and 99.5% for severity grading on benchmark datasets. In real-world clinical validation, the accuracy was 97.9%, reflecting high performance but also revealing potential challenges in generalizing to diverse demographic and imaging conditions. Grad-CAM visualizations provided clear localization of pathological regions, aiding interpretability and clinical trust.ConclusionsThe MFFN demonstrates strong potential for cost-effective, rapid, and large-scale screening of macular edema, offering a valuable AI-assisted diagnostic tool for ophthalmologists. While preliminary results are highly promising, further validation on larger and more diverse patient populations is essential to ensure robustness and clinical applicability. Future work will focus on optimizing generalizability and integrating the model into practical healthcare workflows.

AB  - Aim This study aims to develop a robust and lightweight deep learning model for early brain tumor detection using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), particularly under constraints of limited data availability. Objective: To design a CNN-based diagnostic model that accurately classifies MRI brain scans into tumor-positive and tumor-negative categories with high clinical relevance, despite a small dataset. Methods: A five-layer CNN architecture-comprising three convolutional layers, two pooling layers, and a fully connected dense layer-was implemented using TensorFlow and TFlearn. A dataset of 189 grayscale brain MRI images was used, with balanced classes. The model was trained over 10 epochs and 202 iterations using the Adam optimizer. Evaluation metrics included accuracy, precision, recall, F1 Score, and ROC AUC.Results The proposed model achieved 99% accuracy in both training and validation. Key performance metrics, including precision (98.75%), recall (99.20%), F1-score (98.87%), and ROC-AUC (0.99), affirmed the model's reliability. The loss decreased from 0.412 to near zero. A comparative analysis with a baseline TensorFlow model trained on 1,800 images showed the superior performance of the proposed model.Conclusion The results demonstrate that accurate brain tumor detection can be achieved with limited data using a carefully optimized CNN. Future work will expand datasets and integrate explainable AI for enhanced clinical integration.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a prevalent and serious global health issue, with a significant impact on individuals globally. Hence, it is imperative to promptly obtain an accurate diagnosis and interpretation for the commencement of appropriate treatment as timely detection and intervention can enhance the probability of long-term survival. Existing projection-based methods for feature selection do not yield desired outcomes due to their different objectives necessitating the need for innovation approaches for a higher predictive performance. This study proposes a novel fusion-based feature selection (FFS) model for the optimization and selection of distinct features to enhance CKD diagnosis. This study utilizes the University of California, Irvine (UCI) CKD dataset and addresses missing data and imbalance issues through Multiple Imputations by Chain Equation (MICE) and Borderline Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (Borderline-SMOTE). The proposed model integrates different machine learning (ML) classifiers, conventionally known as black boxes, with SHAP values to provide interpretability and gain transparency in the decision-making process. The proposed FFS model performs better than single feature selection approaches, achieving 100% in all of the evaluation metrics for support vector machine, light gradient boosting, random forest, voting and extreme gradient boosting classifiers compared to other existing literature that also utilized the same dataset. Notably, the SHAP analysis reveals that features such as red blood cell, white blood cell count and the pus cell clumps show model specific interactions. This aids healthcare in understanding and effectively applying the model's outputs. Empirical evidence demonstrates that our proposed approach exhibits superior performance which has the potential to complement physicians' diagnosis of kidney diseases. Also, the incorporation of explainability enhances the clarity of outcomes and facilitates the identification of the underlying cause of the diseases, contributing to more transparency and ethically sound AI applications in healthcare.

AB  - Background:Artificial intelligence (AI), and in particular large language models (LLMs) such as Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT) and Gemini have provided additional resources for patients to research the management of healthcare conditions, for their own edification and the advocacy in the care of their children. The accuracy of these models, however, and the sources from which they draw conclusions, have been largely unstudied in pediatric orthopaedics. This research aimed to assess the reliability of machine learning tools in providing appropriate recommendations for the care of common pediatric orthopaedic conditions.Methods:ChatGPT and Gemini were queried using plain language generated from the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) listed on the Pediatric Orthopedic Society of North America (POSNA) web page. Two independent reviewers assessed the accuracy of the responses, and chi-square analyses were used to compare the 2 LLMs. Inter-rater reliability was calculated via Cohen's Kappa coefficient. If research studies were cited, attempts were made to assess their legitimacy by searching the PubMed and Google Scholar databases.Results:ChatGPT and Gemini performed similarly, agreeing with the AAOS CPGs at a rate of 67% and 69%. No significant differences were observed in the performance between the 2 LLMs. ChatGPT did not reference specific studies in any response, whereas Gemini referenced a total of 16 research papers in 6 of 24 responses. 12 of the 16 studies referenced contained errors and either were unable to be identified (7) or contained discrepancies (5) regarding publication year, journal, or proper accreditation of authorship.Conclusion:The LLMs investigated were frequently aligned with the AAOS CPGs; however, the rate of neutral statements or disagreement with consensus recommendations was substantial and frequently contained errors with citations of sources. These findings suggest there remains room for growth and transparency in the development of the models which power AI, and they may not yet represent the best source of up-to-date healthcare information for patients or providers.

AB  - Machine learning algorithms that are both interpretable and accurate are essential in applications such as medicine where errors can have a dire consequence. Unfortunately, there is currently a tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability among state-of-the-art methods. Decision trees are interpretable and are therefore used extensively throughout medicine for stratifying patients. Current decision tree algorithms, however, are consistently outperformed in accuracy by other, less-interpretable machine learning models, such as ensemble methods. We present MediBoost, a novel framework for constructing decision trees that retain interpretability while having accuracy similar to ensemble methods, and compare MediBoost's performance to that of conventional decision trees and ensemble methods on 13 medical classification problems. MediBoost significantly outperformed current decision tree algorithms in 11 out of 13 problems, giving accuracy comparable to ensemble methods. The resulting trees are of the same type as decision trees used throughout clinical practice but have the advantage of improved accuracy. Our algorithm thus gives the best of both worlds: it grows a single, highly interpretable tree that has the high accuracy of ensemble methods.

AB  - In digital healthcare applications, anomaly detection is an important task to be taken into account. For instance, in ECG (Electrocardiogram) analysis, the aim is often to detect abnormal ECG signals that are considered outliers. For such tasks, it has been shown that deep learning models such as Autoencoders (AEs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) can provide state-of-the-art performance. However, they suffer from certain limitations. For example, the trivial method of threshold selection does not perform well if we do not know the reconstruction loss distribution in advance. In addition, since healthcare applications rely on highly sensitive personal information, data privacy concerns can arise when data are collected and processed in a centralized machine-learning setting. Hence, in order to address these challenges, in this paper, we propose AnoFed, a novel framework for combining the transformer-based AE and VAE with the Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) in a federated setting. It can enhance privacy protection, improve the explainability of results and support adaptive anomaly detection. Using ECG anomaly detection as a typical application of the framework in healthcare, we conducted experiments to show that the proposed framework is not only effective (in terms of the detection performance) but also efficient (in terms of computational costs), compared with a number of state-of-the-art methods in the literature. AnoFed is very lightweight in terms of the number of parameters and computation, hence it can be used in applications with resource-constrained edge devices.

AB  - Dementia is an incurable neurodegenerative disease primarily affecting the older population, for which the World Health Organisation has set to promoting early diagnosis and timely management as one of the primary goals for dementia care. While a range of popular machine learning algorithms and their variants have been applied for dementia diagnosis, fuzzy systems, which have been known effective in dealing with uncertainty and offer to explicitly reason how a diagnosis can be inferred, sporadically appear in recent literature. Given the advantages of a fuzzy rule-based model, which could potentially result in a clinical decision support system that offers understandable rules and a transparent inference process to support dementia diagnosis, this paper proposes a novel fuzzy inference system by adapting the concept of dominant sets that arise from the study of graph theory. A peeling-off strategy is used to iteratively extract from the constructed edge-weighted graph a collection of dominant sets. Each dominant set is further converted into a parameterized fuzzy rule, which is finally optimized in a supervised adaptive network-based fuzzy inference framework.

AB  - Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a critical imaging modality for diagnosing ocular and systemic conditions, yet its accessibility is hindered by the need for specialized expertise and high computational demands. To address these challenges, we introduce ChatOCT, an offline-capable, domain-adaptive clinical decision support system (CDSS) that integrates structured expert Q&A generation, OCT-specific knowledge injection, and activation-aware model compression. Unlike existing systems, ChatOCT functions without internet access, making it suitable for low-resource environments. ChatOCT is built upon LLaMA-2-7B, incorporating domain-specific knowledge from PubMed and OCT News through a two-stage training process: (1) knowledge injection for OCT-specific expertise and (2) Q&A instruction tuning for structured, interactive diagnostic reasoning. To ensure feasibility in offline environments, we apply activation-aware weight quantization, reducing GPU memory usage to similar to 4.74 GB, enabling deployment on standard OCT hardware. A novel expert answer generation framework mitigates hallucinations by structuring responses in a multi-step process, ensuring accuracy and interpretability. ChatOCT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as LLaMA-2, PMC-LLaMA-13B, and ChatDoctor by 10-15 points in coherence, relevance, and clinical utility, while reducing GPU memory requirements by 79%, while maintaining real-time responsiveness (similar to 20 ms inference time). Expert ophthalmologists rated ChatOCT's outputs as clinically actionable and aligned with real-world decision-making needs, confirming its potential to assist frontline healthcare providers. ChatOCT represents an innovative offline clinical decision support system for optical coherence tomography (OCT) that runs entirely on local embedded hardware, enabling real-time analysis in resource-limited settings without internet connectivity. By offering a scalable, generalizable pipeline that integrates knowledge injection, instruction tuning, and model compression, ChatOCT provides a blueprint for next-generation, resource-efficient clinical AI solutions across multiple medical domains.

AB  - Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common clinical condition with high mortality and resource consumption. Early identification of high-risk patients to achieve an appropriate allocation of limited clinical resources and timely interventions is of significant importance, which has attracted substantial research to develop prediction models for AKI risk stratification. However, most available AKI prediction models have moderate performance and lack of interpretability, which limits their applicability in supporting care intervention. In this paper, a machine learning-based framework for AKI prediction and interpretation in critical care is presented. First, an ensemble model is developed to predict a patient's risk of AKI within 72 h of admission to the intensive care units. Next, the model is interpreted both globally and locally. For the global interpretation, the important predictors are pinpointed and the detailed relationships between AKI risk and these predictors are illustrated. For the local interpretation, patient-specific analysis is presented to provide a visualized explanation for each individual prediction. Experimental results show that such a prediction and interpretation framework can lead to good prediction and interpretation performance, which has the potential to provide effective clinical decision support.

AB  - Cerebral stroke is a major global health issue, contributing to high mortality and long-term disability. Early identification of individuals at high risk of stroke can significantly improve preventive care outcomes. We present a web-based stroke risk assessment tool that uniquely combines an accessible user interface with robust machine learning modeling. The proposed platform leverages a novel combination of SMOTE oversampling and logistic regression to address class imbalance in patient health records, improving the detection of stroke risk factors over existing methods. We compare a range of algorithms-including traditional classifiers and deep learning models-and report comprehensive performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC) for each. Our best model (logistic regression with SMOTE and standard scaling) achieves 93.2% accuracy with a substantially higher F1-score for the stroke-positive class than other models, indicating improved sensitivity to stroke cases. To bridge the gap between complex predictive models and end-users, we deploy this model in an intuitive web interface (built with Streamlit) that non-technical individuals and healthcare providers can easily use. This interface requires no specialized knowledge, preserves user privacy by avoiding any data storage, and provides clear explanations of results. By offering a practical and transparent tool for stroke risk screening, our work advances health informatics with an emphasis on accessibility, interpretability, and early intervention. Potential applications range from personal health self-assessment to integration in clinical workflows for preventive care, ultimately aiming to improve public health outcomes through early detection and intervention in stroke.

AB  - Objectives Inpatients with language barriers and complex medical needs suffer disparities in quality of care, safety, and health outcomes. Although in-person interpreters are particularly beneficial for these patients, they are underused. We plan to use machine learning predictive analytics to reliably identify patients with language barriers and complex medical needs to prioritize them for in-person interpreters.Materials and methods This qualitative study used stakeholder engagement through semi-structured interviews to understand the perceived risks and benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) in this domain. Stakeholders included clinicians, interpreters, and personnel involved in caring for these patients or for organizing interpreters. Data were coded and analyzed using NVIVO software.Results We completed 49 interviews. Key perceived risks included concerns about transparency, accuracy, redundancy, privacy, perceived stigmatization among patients, alert fatigue, and supply-demand issues. Key perceived benefits included increased awareness of in-person interpreters, improved standard of care and prioritization for interpreter utilization; a streamlined process for accessing interpreters, empowered clinicians, and potential to overcome clinician bias.Discussion This is the first study that elicits stakeholder perspectives on the use of AI with the goal of improved clinical care for patients with language barriers. Perceived benefits and risks related to the use of AI in this domain, overlapped with known hazards and values of AI but some benefits were unique for addressing challenges with providing interpreter services to patients with language barriers.Conclusion Artificial intelligence to identify and prioritize patients for interpreter services has the potential to improve standard of care and address healthcare disparities among patients with language barriers.

AB  - The pandemic outbreak has revealed significant flaws in the complex and highly fragmented Healthcare Supply Chain's (HSC's). However, two major issues persist in the HSCs, leading to inefficiencies: transparency in vaccine distribution and accuracy in demand forecasting. The recent pandemic has highlighted and intensified existing vulnerabilities in HSC's, leading to the effective utilization of digital technologies to manage them. This research proposes a novel framework that merges Blockchain (BC) and Machine Learning (ML) to bolster the HSCs amidst pandemics, by developing a framework named the Predictive BlockVax Distribution Network (PBDN) model. The proposed PBDN model utilizes BC for securing transactions and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), for precise demand prediction. Leveraging Hyperledger Besu, which represents an Ethereum client that is accessible for public use, the PBDN framework ensures BC's privacy, scalability, and efficient network operations, while LSTM's advanced forecasting outperforms traditional models and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. This integration showcases a significant leap in managing vaccine distribution and enhancing system resilience, fairness, and transparency. The proposed PBDN model illustrates the potential of BC and ML together to tackle pandemic-induced Supply Chains (SC's) disruptions, providing a decentralized solution that supports autonomous, informed decision-making without third-party dependency. This approach not only addresses immediate challenges but also sets a precedent for future crisis response, emphasizing the need for robust, Transparent Supply Chain's (TSC's).

AB  - Objectives This study aims to evaluate the utility of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare, focusing on their applications in enhancing patient care through improved diagnostic, decision-making processes, and as ancillary tools for healthcare professionals.Materials and Methods We evaluated ChatGPT, GPT-4, and LLaMA in identifying patients with specific diseases using gold-labeled Electronic Health Records (EHRs) from the MIMIC-III database, covering three prevalent diseases-Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)-along with the rare condition, Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC), and the hard-to-diagnose condition Cancer Cachexia.Results In patient identification, GPT-4 had near similar or better performance compared to the corresponding disease-specific Machine Learning models (F1-score >= 85%) on COPD, CKD, and PBC. GPT-4 excelled in the PBC use case, achieving a 4.23% higher F1-score compared to disease-specific "Traditional Machine Learning" models. ChatGPT and LLaMA3 demonstrated lower performance than GPT-4 across all diseases and almost all metrics. Few-shot prompts also help ChatGPT, GPT-4, and LLaMA3 achieve higher precision and specificity but lower sensitivity and Negative Predictive Value.Discussion The study highlights the potential and limitations of LLMs in healthcare. Issues with errors, explanatory limitations and ethical concerns like data privacy and model transparency suggest that these models would be in clinical settings. Future studies should improve training datasets and model designs for LLMs to gain better utility in healthcare.Conclusion The study shows that LLMs have the potential to assist clinicians for tasks such as patient identification but false positives and false negatives must be mitigated before LLMs are adequate for real-world clinical assistance.

AB  - BackgroundThe frequency of hip and knee arthroplasty surgeries has been rising steadily in recent decades. This trend is attributed to an aging population, leading to increased demands on healthcare systems. Fast Track (FT) surgical protocols, perioperative procedures designed to expedite patient recovery and early mobilization, have demonstrated efficacy in reducing hospital stays, convalescence periods, and associated costs. However, the criteria for selecting patients for FT procedures have not fully capitalized on the available patient data, including patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs).MethodsOur study focused on developing machine learning (ML) models to support decision making in assigning patients to FT procedures, utilizing data from patients' self-reported health status. These models are specifically designed to predict the potential health status improvement in patients initially selected for FT. Our approach focused on techniques inspired by the concept of controllable AI. This includes eXplainable AI (XAI), which aims to make the model's recommendations comprehensible to clinicians, and cautious prediction, a method used to alert clinicians about potential control losses, thereby enhancing the models' trustworthiness and reliability.ResultsOur models were trained and tested using a dataset comprising 899 records from individual patients admitted to the FT program at IRCCS Ospedale Galeazzi-Sant'Ambrogio. After training and selecting hyper-parameters, the models were assessed using a separate internal test set. The interpretable models demonstrated performance on par or even better than the most effective 'black-box' model (Random Forest). These models achieved sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value (PPV) exceeding 70%, with an area under the curve (AUC) greater than 80%. The cautious prediction models exhibited enhanced performance while maintaining satisfactory coverage (over 50%). Further, when externally validated on a separate cohort from the same hospital-comprising patients from a subsequent time period-the models showed no pragmatically notable decline in performance.ConclusionsOur results demonstrate the effectiveness of utilizing PROMs as basis to develop ML models for planning assignments to FT procedures. Notably, the application of controllable AI techniques, particularly those based on XAI and cautious prediction, emerges as a promising approach. These techniques provide reliable and interpretable support, essential for informed decision-making in clinical processes.

AB  - Current medical limitations in predicting cancer survival status and time necessitate advancements beyond traditional methods and physical indicators. This research introduces a novel two-stage prognostic framework for renal cell carcinoma, addressing the inadequacies of existing diagnostic approaches. In the first stage, the framework accurately predicts the survival status (alive or deceased) with metrics Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 score to evaluate the effects of the classification results, while the second stage focuses on forecasting the future survival time of deceased patients with Root Mean Square Error and Mean Absolute Error to evaluate the regression results. Leveraging popular machine learning models, such as Adaptive Boosting, Extra Trees, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and Extreme Gradient Boosting, along with fusion models like Voting, Stacking, and Blending, our approach significantly improves prognostic accuracy as shown in our experiments. The novelty of our research lies in the integration of a logistic regression meta-model for interpreting the blending model's predictions, enhancing transparency. By the SHapley Additive exPlanations' interpretability, we provide insights into variable contributions, aiding understanding at both global and local levels. Through modal segmentation and multimodal fusion applied to raw data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, we enhance the precision of renal cell carcinoma prognosis. Our proposed model provides an interpretable analysis of model predictions, highlighting key variables influencing classification and regression decisions in the two-stage renal cell carcinoma prognosis framework. By addressing the black-box problem inherent in machine learning, our proposed model helps healthcare practitioners with a more reliable and transparent basis for applying machine learning in cancer prognostication.

AB  - BackgroundThe deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare has the potential to transform patient care through improved diagnostics, personalized treatment plans, and more efficient resource management. However, the effectiveness and fairness of AI are critically dependent on the data it learns from. Biased datasets can lead to AI outputs that perpetuate disparities, particularly affecting social minorities and marginalized groups.ObjectiveThis paper introduces the "Data Artifacts Glossary", a dynamic, open-source framework designed to systematically document and update potential biases in healthcare datasets. The aim is to provide a comprehensive tool that enhances the transparency and accuracy of AI applications in healthcare and contributes to understanding and addressing health inequities.MethodsUtilizing a methodology inspired by the Delphi method, a diverse team of experts conducted iterative rounds of discussions and literature reviews. The team synthesized insights to develop a comprehensive list of bias categories and designed the glossary's structure. The Data Artifacts Glossary was piloted using the MIMIC-IV dataset to validate its utility and structure.ResultsThe Data Artifacts Glossary adopts a collaborative approach modeled on successful open-source projects like Linux and Python. Hosted on GitHub, it utilizes robust version control and collaborative features, allowing stakeholders from diverse backgrounds to contribute. Through a rigorous peer review process managed by community members, the glossary ensures the continual refinement and accuracy of its contents. The implementation of the Data Artifacts Glossary with the MIMIC-IV dataset illustrates its utility. It categorizes biases, and facilitates their identification and understanding.ConclusionThe Data Artifacts Glossary serves as a vital resource for enhancing the integrity of AI applications in healthcare by providing a mechanism to recognize and mitigate dataset biases before they impact AI outputs. It not only aids in avoiding bias in model development but also contributes to understanding and addressing the root causes of health disparities.

AB  - Modern healthcare is increasingly relying on Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) systems, which continuously collect health data and provide the ability to monitor patients in real-time. RPM systems are extremely susceptible to cyber threats due to their growing reliance on interconnected devices and hence need comprehensive security. AI has emerged as a crucial technology for addressing security issues in RPM systems. The objective of this survey is to understand the impact on the security of RPM systems by integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) with threat intelligence. This survey analyzed 86 research articles from leading databases related to AI models, security of RPM systems, anomaly detection, and architectural solutions, in addition to 24 articles related to existing RPMs. This survey article emphasizes that RPM systems become much more resilient when automated attack mitigation, real-time anomaly detection, and predictive analytics are provided by AI-powered models. To secure the sensitive data in RPM, this survey discusses how AI can be applied to various architectural solutions, including edge computing, cloud integration, blockchain technology, and Federated Learning (FL). Furthermore, the benefits and challenges of deploying AI-driven threat intelligence, cross-platform compatibility, and the need for explainable AI to improve trust in automatically made decisions are presented. Moreover, this review highlights research gaps, including the necessity of comprehensive end-to-end architectures for maintaining security and privacy in RPM systems. It is revealed through this survey that AI-powered threat intelligence enhances RPM security considerably due to its ability of continuous monitoring, adaptive defense mechanisms, and early detection of threats. However, challenges such as the explainability of AI models persist and necessitate continued innovation. The survey paper suggests integrating AI-enhanced threat Detection as a Service (TDaas) that implements FL to transform the existing RPM security system, and ultimately contributes to a secure and reliable threat detection system in healthcare. This review provides a roadmap for future research in the area of AI-driven threat intelligence security for RPM systems and offers insights for developing resilient healthcare infrastructure.

AB  - Epidemiological studies increasingly rely on advanced analytics to uncover complex relationships in health data. This study employs an innovative SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)-driven framework to enhance the interpretability of machine learning models applied to a dataset of 1200 patients. Key features, including demographic, anthropometric, lifestyle, and clinical parameters, were analyzed using a Random Forest classifier integrated with SHAP values. Health outcomes, specifically the presence of chronic diseases such as diabetes, were predicted with high accuracy (85 %) and AUC (0.89), outperforming logistic regression (accuracy = 79 %, AUC = 0.84). SHAP values further highlighted influential predictors such as BMI and age, offering insights into individual contributions to health outcomes. By bridging traditional epidemiological analysis and modern machine learning techniques, this study offers a transparent and interpretable model for healthcare decisionmaking.

TI  - Morphological and molecular breast cancer profiling through explainable machine learning
T2  - NATURE MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
LA  - English
AB  - Recent advances in cancer research and diagnostics largely rely on new developments in microscopic or molecular profiling techniques, offering high levels of detail with respect to either spatial or molecular features, but usually not both. Here, we present an explainable machine-learning approach for the integrated profiling of morphological, molecular and clinical features from breast cancer histology. First, our approach allows for the robust detection of cancer cells and tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes in histological images, providing precise heatmap visualizations explaining the classifier decisions. Second, molecular features, including DNA methylation, gene expression, copy number variations, somatic mutations and proteins are predicted from histology. Molecular predictions reach balanced accuracies up to 78%, whereas accuracies of over 95% can be achieved for subgroups of patients. Finally, our explainable AI approach allows assessment of the link between morphological and molecular cancer properties. The resulting computational multiplex-histology analysis can help promote basic cancer research and precision medicine through an integrated diagnostic scoring of histological, clinical and molecular features.
   Cancers are complex diseases that are increasingly studied using a diverse set of omics data. At the same time, histological images show the interaction of cells, which is not visible with bulk omics methods. Binder and colleagues present a method to learn from both kinds of data, such that molecular markers can be associated with visible patterns in the tissue samples and be used for more accurate breast cancer diagnosis.

AB  - Background: Worldwide, sepsis is the leading cause of death in hospitals. If mortality rates in patients with sepsis can be predicted early, medical resources can be allocated efficiently. We constructed machine learning (ML) models to predict the mortality of patients with sepsis in a hospital emergency department. Methods: This study prospectively collected nationwide data from an ongoing multicenter cohort of patients with sepsis identified in the emergency department. Patients were enrolled from 19 hospitals between September 2019 and December 2020. For acquired data from 3,657 survivors and 1,455 deaths, six ML models (logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, extreme gradient boosting [XGBoost], light gradient boosting machine, and categorical boosting [CatBoost]) were constructed using fivefold cross-validation to predict mortality. Through these models, 44 clinical variables measured on the day of admission were compared with six sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) components (PaO2/FIO2 [PF], platelets (PLT), bilirubin, cardiovascular, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and creatinine). The confidence interval (CI) was obtained by performing 10,000 repeated measurements via random sampling of the test dataset. All results were explained and interpreted using Shapley's additive explanations (SHAP). Results: Of the 5,112 participants, CatBoost exhibited the highest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.800 (95% CI, 0.756-0.840) using clinical variables. Using the SOFA components for the same patient, XGBoost exhibited the highest AUC of 0.678 (95% CI, 0.626-0.730). As interpreted by SHAP, albumin, lactate, blood urea nitrogen, and international normalization ratio were determined to significantly affect the results. Additionally, PF and PLTs in the SOFA component significantly influenced the prediction results. Conclusion: Newly established ML-based models achieved good prediction of mortality in patients with sepsis. Using several clinical variables acquired at the baseline can provide more accurate results for early predictions than using SOFA components. Additionally, the impact of each variable was identified.

AB  - Objective Early detection of surgical complications allows for timely therapy and proactive risk mitigation. Machine learning (ML) can be leveraged to identify and predict patient risks for postoperative complications. We developed and validated the effectiveness of predicting postoperative complications using a novel surgical Variational Autoencoder (surgVAE) that uncovers intrinsic patterns via cross-task and cross-cohort presentation learning.Materials and Methods This retrospective cohort study used data from the electronic health records of adult surgical patients over 4 years (2018-2021). Six key postoperative complications for cardiac surgery were assessed: acute kidney injury, atrial fibrillation, cardiac arrest, deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, blood transfusion, and other intraoperative cardiac events. We compared surgVAE's prediction performance against widely-used ML models and advanced representation learning and generative models under 5-fold cross-validation.Results 89 246 surgeries (49% male, median [IQR] age: 57 [45-69]) were included, with 6502 in the targeted cardiac surgery cohort (61% male, median [IQR] age: 60 [53-70]). surgVAE demonstrated generally superior performance over existing ML solutions across postoperative complications of cardiac surgery patients, achieving macro-averaged AUPRC of 0.409 and macro-averaged AUROC of 0.831, which were 3.4% and 3.7% higher, respectively, than the best alternative method (by AUPRC scores). Model interpretation using Integrated Gradients highlighted key risk factors based on preoperative variable importance.Discussion and Conclusion Our advanced representation learning framework surgVAE showed excellent discriminatory performance for predicting postoperative complications and addressing the challenges of data complexity, small cohort sizes, and low-frequency positive events. surgVAE enables data-driven predictions of patient risks and prognosis while enhancing the interpretability of patient risk profiles.

AB  - Recently, various example-based explainable artificial intelligence (EBXAI) methods have been proposed for diverse medical diagnosis contexts. However, the evaluation of their explanatory performance has been rarely explored in the literature. To address this gap, this paper develops a multicriteria evaluation framework based on the applications of three representative EBXAI methods in breast cancer diagnosis (BCD). In the proposed framework, a unified mathematical model is constructed to formulate the determination of related examples for explanations as a similarity-based general optimization problem. By solving this problem, different types of related examples are obtained to explain the black-box predictions. Building upon these examples, a TOPSISbased multicriteria selection process is designed, incorporating five quantitative evaluation criteria to assess the explanatory performance of EBXAI methods. Using five real-world breast cancer datasets, the proposed framework's effectiveness is validated, and there are three important findings. First, the predictive performance of different black-box models varies across datasets, emphasizing the need to carefully select prediction models for BCD. Second, EBXAI methods exhibit more stable explanatory performance on tabular datasets compared to image datasets. Third, when multiple criteria are combined using the TOPSIS method, the explanation method based on factual examples consistently outperforms those based on contrastive and counterfactual examples. These findings underscore the advantages of the proposed framework over individual-criterion evaluation approaches and provide fresh insights into the application of EBXAI methods for BCD. Furthermore, the evaluation results generated by the framework are rigorously confirmed using statistical tests to ensure their robustness and reliability.

AB  - ObjectivesComplex diseases, like diabetic kidney disease (DKD), often exhibit heterogeneity, challenging accurate risk prediction with machine learning. Traditional global models ignore patient differences, and subgroup learning lacks interpretability and predictive efficiency. This study introduces the Interpretable Subgroup Learning-based Modeling (iSLIM) framework to address these issues.MethodsiSLIM integrates expert knowledge with a tree-based recursive partitioning approach to identify DKD subgroups within an EHR dataset of 11,559 patients. It then constructs separate models for each subgroup, enhancing predictive accuracy while preserving interpretability.ResultsFive clinically relevant subgroups are identified, achieving an average sensitivity of 0.8074, outperforming a single global model by 0.1104. Post hoc analyses provide pathological and biological evidence supporting subgroup validity and potential DKD risk factors.ConclusionThe iSLIM surpasses traditional global model in predictive performance and subgroup-specific risk factor interpretation, enhancing the understanding of DKD's heterogeneous mechanisms and potentially increasing the adoption of machine learning models in clinical decision-making.

AB  - The utility of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare strongly depends upon the quality of the data used to build models, and the confidence in the predictions they generate. Access to sufficient amounts of high-quality data to build accurate and reliable models remains problematic owing to substantive legal and ethical constraints in making clinically relevant research data available offsite. New technologies such as distributed learning offer a pathway forward, but unfortunately tend to suffer from a lack of transparency, which undermines trust in what data are used for the analysis. To address such issues, we hypothesized that, a novel distributed learning that combines sequential distributed learning with a blockchain-based platform, namely Chained Distributed Machine learning C-DistriM, would be feasible and would give a similar result as a standard centralized approach. C-DistriM enables health centers to dynamically participate in training distributed learning models. We demonstrate C-DistriM using the NSCLC-Radiomics open data to predict two-year lung-cancer survival. A comparison of the performance of this distributed solution, evaluated in six different scenarios, and the centralized approach, showed no statistically significant difference (AUCs between central and distributed models), all DeLong tests yielded p-val > 0.05. This methodology removes the need to blindly trust the computation in one specific server on a distributed learning network. This fusion of blockchain and distributed learning serves as a proof-of-concept to increase transparency, trust, and ultimately accelerate the adoption of AI in multicentric studies. We conclude that our blockchain-based model for sequential training on distributed datasets is a feasible approach, provides equivalent performance to the centralized approach.

AB  - Cancer of unknown primary (CUP) is a type of cancer that cannot be traced back to its primary site and accounts for 3-5% of all cancers. Established targeted therapies are lacking for CUP, leading to generally poor outcomes. We developed OncoNPC, a machine-learning classifier trained on targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) data from 36,445 tumors across 22 cancer types from three institutions. Oncology NGS-based primary cancer-type classifier (OncoNPC) achieved a weighted F1 score of 0.942 for high confidence predictions (>= 0.9) on held- out tumor samples, which made up 65.2% of all the held-out samples. When applied to 971 CUP tumors collected at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, OncoNPC predicted primary cancer types with high confidence in 41.2% of the tumors. OncoNPC also identified CUP subgroups with significantly higher polygenic germline risk for the predicted cancer types and with significantly different survival outcomes. Notably, patients with CUP who received first palliative intent treatments concordant with their OncoNPC-predicted cancers had significantly better outcomes (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.348; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.210-0.570; P = 2.32 x 10(-5)). Furthermore, OncoNPC enabled a 2.2-fold increase in patients with CUP who could have received genomically guided therapies. OncoNPC thus provides evidence of distinct CUP subgroups and offers the potential for clinical decision support for managing patients with CUP.

AB  - Background: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) remain the predominant global cause of mortality, with both low and high temperatures increasing CVD-related mortalities. Climate change impacts human health directly through temperature fluctuations and indirectly via factors like disease vectors. Elevated and reduced temperatures have been linked to increases in CVD-related hospitalizations and mortality, with various studies worldwide confirming the significant health implications of temperature variations and air pollution on cardiovascular outcomes. Methods: A database of daily Emergency Room admissions at the Giovanni XIII Polyclinic in Bari (Southern Italy) was developed, spanning from 2013 to 2019, including weather and air quality data. A Random Forest (RF) supervised machine learning model was used to simulate the trend of hospital admissions for CVD. The Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) decomposition model separated the trend component, while cross-validation techniques were employed to prevent overfitting. Model performance was assessed using specific metrics and error analysis. Additionally, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method, a feature importance technique within the eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) framework, was used to identify the feature importance. Results: An R2 of 0.97 and a Mean Absolute Error of 0.36 admissions were achieved by the model. Atmospheric pressure, minimum temperature, and carbon monoxide were found to collectively contribute about 74% to the model's predictive power, with atmospheric pressure being the dominant factor at 37%. Conclusions: This research underscores the significant influence of weatherclimate variables on cardiovascular diseases. The identified key climate factors provide a practical framework for policymakers and healthcare professionals to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change on CVD and devise preventive strategies.

AB  - BackgroundLarge language models (LLMs) have emerged as potential tools in health care following advancements in artificial intelligence. Despite promising applications across multiple medical specialties, limited research exists regarding LLM implementation in pediatric nephrology. This study evaluates the performance of contemporary LLMs in supporting clinical decision-making processes for practicing pediatric nephrologists.MethodsTen comprehensive clinical cases covering various aspects of pediatric nephrology were designed and validated by experts based on international guidelines. Each case comprised questions addressing diagnosis, biological/imaging explorations, treatments, and logic. Ten LLMs were assessed, including generalist models (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, Mistral, Copilot, Perplexity, Phi 4) and a specialized model (Phi 4 Nomic) fine-tuned using retrieval-augmented generation with validated pediatric nephrology materials. Performance was evaluated based on accuracy, personalization, internal contradictions, hallucinations, and potentially dangerous decisions.ResultsOverall accuracy ranged from 50.8% (Gemini) to 86.9% (Claude), with a mean of 66.24%. Claude significantly outperformed other models (p = 0.01). Personalization scores varied between 50% (ChatGPT) and 85% (Claude). All models exhibited hallucinations (2-8 occurrences) and potentially life-threatening decisions (0-2 occurrences). Domain-specific fine-tuning improved performance across all clinical criteria without enhancing reasoning capabilities. Performance variability was minimal, with higher performing models demonstrating greater consistency.ConclusionsWhile certain LLMs demonstrate promising accuracy in pediatric nephrology applications, persistent challenges including hallucinations and potentially dangerous recommendations preclude autonomous clinical implementation. LLMs may currently serve supportive roles in repetitive tasks, but they should be used under strict supervision in clinical practice. Future advancements addressing hallucination mitigation and interpretability are necessary before broader clinical integration.Graphical abstractA higher resolution version of the Graphical abstract is available as Supplementary information

AB  - Background Achieving optimal tacrolimus dosing is vital for effectively balancing therapeutic efficacy and safety, as CYP3A5 genetic variants and inter-patient variability emphasize the need for precision strategies. Aim This study aimed to optimize tacrolimus dosage prediction for renal transplant recipients by incorporating genetic polymorphisms, specifically profiling CYP3A5 genetic variants, within the DoseOptimal framework to enhance interpretability and accuracy of dosing decisions. Method The dataset comprised clinical, demographic, and CYP3A5 genetic variants information from 1045 stable tacrolimus-treated patients. The DoseOptimal framework was developed by integrating the strengths of the most effective algorithms from fifteen machine learning models. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and decision tree insights were incorporated to enhance the framework's interpretability. The framework's performance was assessed using mean absolute error (MAE) and the coefficient of determination (R-2 score). The F-statistic and p value were calculated to validate the framework's statistical significance. Results The Dose Optimal framework demonstrated robust performance with an R-2 score of 0.884 in the training set and 0.830 in the testing set. The MAE was 0.40 mg/day (95% CI 0.38-0.43) in the training set and 0.41 mg/day (95% CI 0.38-0.45) in the testing set. The framework predicted the ideal tacrolimus dosage in 87.6% (n = 275) of the test cohort, with 3.2% (n = 10) underestimation and 9.2% (n = 29) overestimation. The framework's statistical significance was confirmed with an F-statistic of 266.095 and a p value < 0.001. Conclusion The framework provides precision medicine-based dosing solutions tailored to individual genetic profiles, minimizing dosing errors and enhancing patient outcomes.

AB  - The role of artificial intelligence (AI) in augmenting healthcare is expected to grow substantially in future decades. Current research in medical AI focuses on developing, validating, and implementing point-level AI applications in an ad hoc manner. To harness the full power of AI to improve the patient experience and outcomes at a societal scale, however, requires a gestalt shift-with a systematic understanding of AI in the context of healthcare-and so results in its widespread adoption. This translates to four pillars of incorporating AI into healthcare workflow, including physician buy-in, patient acceptance, provider investment, and payer support (the "4Ps"). To achieve these 4Ps, it is imperative to design AI-augmented healthcare delivery systems in view of (1) how physicians integrate AI into their clinical practice and (2) how patients perceive the role of AI in healthcare delivery. This will in turn boost provider investment and payer support. In this paper, we draw from the literature to discuss a series of research questions, including barriers to physician buy-in and patient acceptance, transparency and disclosure, service design, and strategies for increasing AI uptake. We shed light on the principles of purposeful design for AI-augmented healthcare delivery systems and propose a research agenda for operations management scholars to consider as they continue to strengthen their engagement with both healthcare professionals and AI developers.

AB  - Knee effusion, a common and important indicator of joint diseases such as osteoarthritis, is typically more discernible on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans compared to radiographs. However, the use of radiographs for the early detection of knee effusion remains promising due to their cost-effectiveness and accessibility. This multi-center prospective study collected a total of 1413 radiographs from four hospitals between February 2022 to March 2023, of which 1281 were analyzed after exclusions. To automatically detect knee effusion on radiographs, we utilized a state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning-based classification model with a novel preprocessing technique to optimize images for diagnosing knee effusion. The diagnostic performance of the proposed method was significantly higher than that of the baseline model, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.892, accuracy of 0.803, sensitivity of 0.820, and specificity of 0.785. Moreover, the proposed method significantly outperformed two non-orthopedic physicians. Coupled with an explainable artificial intelligence method for visualization, this approach not only improved diagnostic performance but also interpretability, highlighting areas of effusion. These results demonstrate that the proposed method enables the early and accurate classification of knee effusions on radiographs, thereby reducing healthcare costs and improving patient outcomes through timely interventions.

AB  - Accurate forecasting of diabetes burden is essential for healthcare planning, resource allocation, and policy-making. While deep learning models have demonstrated superior predictive capabilities, their real-world applicability is constrained by computational complexity and data quality challenges. This study evaluates the trade-offs between predictive accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency in diabetes forecasting. Four forecasting models were selected based on their ability to capture temporal dependencies and handle missing healthcare data: Transformer with Variational Autoencoder (VAE), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). Annual data on Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), Deaths, and Prevalence from 1990 to 2021 were used to train (1990-2014) and evaluate (2015-2021) the models. Performance was measured using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Robustness tests introduced noise and missing data, while computational efficiency was assessed in terms of training time, inference speed, and memory usage. Statistical significance was analyzed using ANOVA and Tukey's post-hoc tests. The Transformer-VAE model achieved the highest predictive accuracy (MAE: 0.425, RMSE: 0.501) and demonstrated superior resilience to noisy and incomplete data (p<0.01). LSTM effectively captured short-term patterns but struggled with long-term dependencies, while GRU, though computationally efficient, exhibited higher error rates. ARIMA, despite being resource-efficient, showed limited capability in modeling long-term trends, indicating potential benefits in hybrid approaches. While Transformer-VAE provides the most accurate diabetes burden forecasting, its high computational cost and interpretability challenges limit its scalability in resource-constrained settings. These findings highlight the potential of deep learning models for healthcare forecasting, while underscoring the need for further validation before integration into real-world public health decision-making.

AB  - This paper investigates the impact of personalized AI communication on clinical outcomes in breast cancer diagnosis. Our study examines how different AI communication styles influence diagnostic performance, workload, and trust among clinicians, focusing on imaging diagnosis. We engaged 52 clinicians, categorized as interns, juniors, middles, and seniors, who diagnosed patient cases using conventional and assertiveness-based AI communication. Results show that personalized AI communication reduced diagnostic time by a factor of 1.38 for interns and juniors, and by a factor of 1.37 for middle and senior clinicians, without compromising accuracy. Interns and juniors reduced their diagnostic errors by 39.2% with amore authoritative agent, while middle and senior clinicians saw a 5.5% reduction with a more suggestive agent. Clinicians preferred assertiveness-based AI agents for their clarity and competence, valuing detailed, contextual explanations over numerical outputs. These findings underscore the need for adaptable AI communication to build trust, reduce cognitive load, and streamline clinical workflows. This work offers valuable insights for designing effective AI systems in high-stakes domains, contributing significantly to the Human-Computer Interaction community by enhancing our understanding of AI-mediated clinical support.

AB  - Social media contain rich information that can be used to help understand human mind and behavior. Social media data, however, are mostly unstructured (e.g., text and image) and a large number of features may be needed to represent them (e.g., we may need millions of unigrams to represent social media texts). Moreover, accurately assessing human behavior is often difficult (e.g., assessing addiction may require medical diagnosis). As a result, the ground truth data needed to train a supervised human behavior model are often difficult to obtain at a large scale. To avoid overfitting, many state-of-the-art behavior models employ sophisticated unsupervised or self-supervised machine learning methods to leverage a large amount of unsupervised data for both features learning and dimension reduction. Unfortunately, despite their high performance, these advanced machine learning models often rely on latent features that are hard to explain. Since understanding the knowledge captured in these models is important to behavior scientists and public health providers, we explore new methods to build machine learning models that are not only accurate but also interpretable. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in predicting Substance Use Disorders (SUD). We believe the methods we proposed are general and applicable to a wide range of data-driven human trait and behavior analysis applications.

AB  - Objective: Sepsis is a life-threatening response to infection and a major cause of hospital mortality. Machine learning (ML) models have demonstrated better sepsis prediction performance than integer risk scores but are less widely used in clinical settings, in part due to lower interpretability. This study aimed to improve the interpretability of an ML-based model without reducing its performance in non-ICU sepsis prediction. Methods: A logistic regression model was trained to predict sepsis onset and then converted into a more interpretable integer point system, STEWS, using its regression coefficients. We compared STEWS with the logistic regression model using PPV at 90% sensitivity. Results: STEWS was significantly equivalent to logistic regression using the two one-sided tests procedure (0.051 vs. 0.051; p = 0.004). Conclusions: STEWS demonstrated equivalent performance to a comparable logistic regression model for non-ICU sepsis prediction, suggesting that converting ML models into more interpretable forms does not necessarily reduce predictive power.

AB  - During the course of increasing individualization of oncological diagnosis and treatment, ever larger datasets of complex clinical, molecular, radiological, and histopathological (imaging) data are becoming available. At the same time, advances at a technical and algorithmic level in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) render it possible to utilize this medical big data reservoir for diagnostic purposes and to predict prognosis as well as treatment response. Despite an increasing number of promising applications providing a proof of concept, the widespread use of AI procedures in everyday pathological practice is still a distant prospect. A prerequisite for this is the digitalization of pathological specimens, e.g., using whole-slide imaging (WSI). Key points for a successful AI transformation of pathology are likely to depend on an increase in the accuracy, reproducibility, explainability, interpretability, and resulting reliability of AI-based systems, accompanied by an early involvement of pathologists in this complex implementation task. Based on the current state of research, this review sheds light on the current and future significance of artificial intelligence for (routine) histopathological diagnostic methods.

AB  - Current clinical care relies heavily on complex, rule-based systems for tasks like diagnosis and treatment. However, these systems can be cumbersome and require constant updates. This study explores the potential of the large language model (LLM), LLaMA 2, to address these limitations. We tested LLaMA 2 ' s performance in interpreting complex clinical process models, such as Mayo Clinic Care Pathway Models (CPMs), and providing accurate clinical recommendations. LLM was trained on encoded pathways versions using DOT language, embedding them with SentenceTransformer, and then presented with hypothetical patient cases. We compared the token-level accuracy between LLM output and the ground truth by measuring both node and edge accuracy. LLaMA 2 accurately retrieved the diagnosis, suggested further evaluation, and delivered appropriate management steps, all based on the pathways. The average node accuracy across the different pathways was 0.91 (SD +/- 0.045), while the average edge accuracy was 0.92 (SD +/- 0.122). This study highlights the potential of LLMs for healthcare information retrieval, especially when relevant data are provided. Future research should focus on improving these models' interpretability and their integration into existing clinical workflows.

AB  - In the domain of artificial intelligence, the incorporation of multimodal data has become increasingly popular as a method to improve the performance of models by offering a more comprehensive range of information for learning. The gas classification, which is of utmost importance in multiple fields like industry, security, and healthcare, has received considerable interest. Nevertheless, a review of current research indicates that numerous studies suffer from inadequate data governance, resulting in subpar performance despite how complicated their proposed methodologies are. Although explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques are gaining recognition for their ability to assist researchers in analyzing and enhancing model performance, their use in multimodal gas classification is still limited. This research presents a method that integrates strong data governance practices with XAI to improve the accuracy of models in classifying different types of gases using multimodal input. Our approach enhances data quality and offers a very efficient model architecture with a minimal parameter number of 0.8 million. The proposed model attains testing accuracies of 98.49% for the sensor modality, 96.48% for the image modality, and 99.4% for the fusion modality, surpassing the maximum accuracy achieved by existing state-of-the-art models, which stands at 99.2% with 106 million parameters. Notably, our model is 132.5 times smaller than the most accurate model currently used in multimodal gas classification studies. The proposed model's robustness and trustworthiness are confirmed by extensive testing. The results demonstrate that our approach makes a significant contribution to the field of multimodal classification.

AB  - Good data quality is vital for personalising plans in rehabilitation. Machine learning (ML) improves prognostics but integrating it with Multiple Imputation (MImp) for dealing missingness is an unexplored field. This work aims to provide post-stroke ambulation prognosis, integrating MImp with ML, and identify the prognostic influential factors. Stroke survivors in intensive rehabilitation were enrolled. Data on demographics, events, clinical, physiotherapy, and psycho-social assessment were collected. An independent ambulation at discharge, using the Functional Ambulation Category scale, was the outcome. After handling missingness using MImp, ML models were optimised, cross-validated, and tested. Interpretability techniques analysed predictor contributions. Pre-MImp, the dataset included 54.1% women, 79.2% ischaemic patients, median age 80.0 (interquartile range: 15.0). Post-MImp, 368 non-ambulatory patients on 10 imputed datasets were used for training, 80 for testing. The random forest (the validation best-performing algorithm) obtained 75.5% aggregated balanced accuracy on the test set. The main predictors included modified Barthel index, Fugl-Meyer assessment/motricity index, short physical performance battery, age, Charlson comorbidity index/cumulative illness rating scale, and trunk control test. This is among the first studies applying ML, together with MImp, to predict ambulation recovery in post-stroke rehabilitation. This pipeline reliably exploits the potential of incomplete datasets for healthcare prognosis, identifying relevant predictors.

TI  - Digital Health and Artificial Intelligence: Advancing Healthcare Provision in Latin America
T2  - IT PROFESSIONAL
LA  - English
AB  - Artificial intelligence (Al) has shown enormous potential for transforming healthcare delivery and accessibility in low- and middle-income countries such as those in Latin America, which are among the least equitable regions of the world. While healthcare analytics is already a global trend, in Latin America, it is gaining relevance given its demographic and socio-economic specificity and its particular healthcare systems. Hence, we first explore the linkage between the concepts of Al and digital health. Second, we analyze various types of Al technology in the healthcare sector, and finally, we discuss Al health-related services in Latin American countries and classify them according to applications and digital health interventions. We highlight pertinent issues of privacy and transparency in the use of patient data and records, as well as the technological and regulatory difficulties Latin American countries encounter in implementing Al-based services in the healthcare sector, a provision that also contributes to advancing United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

AB  - With the introduction of an artificial intelligence-based dashboard into the clinic, the project SURGE-Ahead responds to the importance of improving perioperative geriatric patient treatment and continuity of care. The use of artificial intelligence to process and analyze data automatically, aims at an evidence-based evaluation of the patient's health condition and recommending treatment options. However, its development and introduction raise ethical questions. To ascertain professional perspectives on the clinical use of the dashboard, we have conducted 19 semi-structured qualitative interviews with head physicians, computer scientists, jurists, and ethicists. The application of a qualitative content analysis and thematic analysis enabled the detection of main ethical concerns, chances, and limitations. These ethical considerations were categorized: changes of the patient-physician relationship and the current social reality are expected, causing de-skilling and an active participation of the artificial intelligence. The interviewees anticipated a redistribution of human resources, time, knowledge, and experiences as well as expenses and financing. Concerns of privacy, accuracy, transparency, and explainability were stated, and an insufficient data basis, an intensifying of existing inequalities and systematic discrimination considering a fair access emphasized. Concluding, the patient-physician relationship, social reality, redistribution of resources, fair access, as well as data-related aspects of the artificial intelligence-based system could conflict with the ethical principles of autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence, and social justice. To respond to these ethical concerns, a responsible use of the dashboard and a critical verification of therapy suggestions is mandatory, and the application limited by questions at the end of life and taking life-changing decisions.

AB  - In the applied sciences, the ultimate goal is not just to acquire knowledge but to turn knowledge into action. The next wave for data disciplines may be experimental designs and analytical methods for closing the gap between the "real-world" situations faced by decision-makers and their idealized representations in optimization problems, and the health sciences are poised to be the discipline where these developments substantially improve lives. We discuss three recent trends in research-experimental designs and analytical methods for precision medicine and pragmatic trials; technological developments in sensors, wearables, and smartphones for measuring health data; and methods addressing algorithmic bias and model interpretability-and argue that these seemingly disparate trends point to a future where data-driven decision support tools are increasingly used to promote wellbeing.

KW  - RECURRENCE
AB  - Predicting cancer patient disease progression is a key step towards personalized medicine and secondary prevention. Risk stratification systems based on clinico-pathological criteria aim to identify high-risk patients, but accurate predictions remain challenging. Deep learning models present new opportunities for patient risk prediction, yet their interpretability has been largely unexplored. We developed a transformer-based approach for predicting progression of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) patients based on diagnostic histopathology tumor slides. Our initial model showed AUROC = 0.92 on a held-out test set, with average AUROC of 0.65 on external validation cohorts. To further increase generalizability and reduce potential privacy concerns, we trained the model in a federated manner across three clinical centers, reaching AUROC = 0.82 across all cohorts, with image-based risk scores achieving hazard ratios up to 7.42 (p < 0.01) in multivariable analyses. Through interpretability analysis, we identified spatial and morphological features predictive of progression, suggesting that tumor boundary information and tissue heterogeneity characterize progressive cSCCs. Trained exclusively on routine diagnostic slides and offering biological insights, our model can improve secondary prevention and understanding of cSCC while enabling deployment across clinical centers without administrative overheads or privacy concerns.

AB  - Accurate and timely analysis of breast cancer data is crucial for the successful deployment and advancement of intelligent healthcare systems. Traditional health status prediction methods, which often rely on shallow models, fall short in complex clinical scenarios and are still unsatisfying for many real-world applications. This situation has inspired us to propose a deep learning-enhanced framework for health data flow prediction. The paper introduces a new three-layer soft computing method for predicting health status using optimizing neural fuzzy systems (ONFS). This approach enhances interpretability by considering spatial correlations in medical data. We start with feature selection based on the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) to eliminate variables with minimal linear or nonlinear relationships. Next, subtractive clustering optimization is applied in each layer to refine the system parameters simultaneously. The ONFS offers clearer and more straightforward explanations of health features in high-dimensional data analysis. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of ONFS over existing methods, achieving an average RMSE reduction of 17.2% and a 98% reduction in rules compared to SVM, with competitive computational efficiency. This research underscores the potential of deep learning-augmented ONFS in enhancing breast cancer data analysis, supporting the information science objectives of precision and interpretability in healthcare data processing.

AB  - Background: As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly prevalent in the medical field, the effectiveness of AI-generated medical reports in disease diagnosis remains to be evaluated. ChatGPT is a large language model developed by open AI with a notable capacity for text abstraction and comprehension. This study aimed to explore the capabilities, limitations, and potential of Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)-4 in analyzing thyroid cancer ultrasound reports, providing diagnoses, and recommending treatment plans. Methods: Using 109 diverse thyroid cancer cases, we evaluated GPT-4's performance by comparing its generated reports to those from doctors with various levels of experience. We also conducted a Turing Test and a consistency analysis. To enhance the interpretability of the model, we applied the Chain of Thought (CoT) method to deconstruct the decision-making chain of the GPT model. Results: GPT-4 demonstrated proficiency in report structuring, professional terminology, and clarity of expression, but showed limitations in diagnostic accuracy. In addition, our consistency analysis highlighted certain discrepancies in the AI's performance. The CoT method effectively enhanced the interpretability of the AI's decision-making process. Conclusions: GPT-4 exhibits potential as a supplementary tool in healthcare, especially for generating thyroid gland diagnostic reports. Our proposed online platform, "ThyroAIGuide", alongside the CoT method, underscores the potential of AI to augment diagnostic processes, elevate healthcare accessibility, and advance patient education. However, the journey towards fully integrating AI into healthcare is ongoing, requiring continuous research, development, and careful monitoring by medical professionals to ensure patient safety and quality of care.

AB  - Dysfunctional regulations of gene expression programs relevant to fundamental cell processes can drive carcinogenesis. Therefore, systematically identifying dysregulation events is an effective path for understanding carcinogenesis and provides insightful clues to build predictive signatures with mechanistic interpretability for cancer precision medicine. Here, we implemented a machine learning-based gene dysregulation analysis framework in an R package, DysRegSig, which is capable of exploring gene dysregulations from high-dimensional data and building mechanistic signature based on gene dysregulations. DysRegSig can serve as an easy-to-use tool to facilitate gene dysregulation analysis and follow-up analysis.

AB  - Introduction: Artificial intelligence (AI) may benefit pediatric healthcare, but it also raises ethical and pragmatic questions. Parental support is important for the advancement of AI in pediatric medicine. However, there is little literature describing parental attitudes to-ward AI in pediatric healthcare, and existing studies do not represent parents of hospitalized children well.Methods: We administered the Attitudes toward Artificial Intelligence in Pediatric Health-care, a validated survey, to parents of hospitalized children in a single tertiary children's hospital. Surveys were administered by trained study personnel (11/2/2021-5/1/2022). Demographic data were collected. An Attitudes toward Artificial Intelligence in Pediatric Healthcare score, assessing openness toward AI-assisted medicine, was calculated for seven areas of concern. Subgroup analyses were conducted using Mann-Whitney U tests to assess the effect of race, gender, education, insurance, length of stay, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission on AI use.Results: We approached 90 parents and conducted 76 surveys for a response rate of 84%. Overall, parents were open to the use of AI in pediatric medicine. Social justice, convenience, privacy, and shared decision-making were important concerns. Parents of children admitted to an ICU expressed the most significantly different attitudes compared to par-ents of children not admitted to an ICU. Conclusions: Parents were overall supportive of AI-assisted healthcare decision-making. In particular, parents of children admitted to ICU have significantly different attitudes, and further study is needed to characterize these differences. Parents value transparency and disclosure pathways should be developed to support this expectation. 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Advanced data analytics are increasingly being employed in healthcare research to improve patient classification and personalize medicinal therapies. In this paper, we focus on the critical problem of clustering electronic health record (EHR) data to enable appropriate patient categorization. In the era of personalized medicine, optimizing patient classification is critical to healthcare analytics. This research presents a comparative assessment of different clustering algorithms for Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, with the goal of improving the efficacy and productivity of patient clustering methods. Our study focuses on Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (Fuzzy TOPSIS) as a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) strategy, includes an in-depth assessment of eight clustering algorithms: K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering, Mean Shift, Affinity Propagation, Spectral Clustering, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), as well as Self-Organizing Maps. The evaluation factors used for evaluation in this research are Cluster Quality Metrics, Scalability, Robustness to Noise, Cluster Shape and Density, Interpretability, Cluster Number, Dimensionality, and Consistency and Stability. These criteria and alternatives were chosen after conducting a thorough assessment of the literature and consulting with domain experts. All participated specialists actively engaged in the decision-making process, bringing unique insights into the best clustering algorithms for healthcare data. The results of this study illustrate each algorithm's strengths and weaknesses in the setting of patient stratification, providing insight into their performance across multiple dimensions. The fuzzy TOPSIS MCDM strategy is a reliable instrument for synthesizing expert opinions and methodically evaluating the found clustering alternatives. This study advances healthcare analytics by giving practitioners and researchers with informative perspectives on the selection of clustering algorithms designed to address the unique problems of patient stratification utilizing EHR data.

AB  - With the extensive use of information systems in hospitals, a large quantity of electronic medical record data has been accumulated, which makes it possible to train clinical decision support systems based on the data. However, electronic medical records are written by doctors of different levels, which easily introduces label noise into the datasets. The lack of interpretability of current auxiliary diagnosis methods is another problem. To address these challenges, we introduce a matching network based on medical guidelines and build an auxiliary diagnosis model based on self-paced learning. The matching network based on guidelines can provide medical knowledge beyond medical records and a certain degree of interpretability. Additionally, self-paced learning can help the model identify the label noise and prevent the model from being misled. The experiments show that our method outperforms the baselines in a Chinese medical multi-disease diagnosis dataset and the MIMIC-III dataset and has good performance in the label noise detection task.

AB  - In recent years, Artificial Intelligence has been used to assist healthcare professionals in detecting and diagnosing neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we propose a methodology to analyze functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging signals and perform classification between Parkinson's disease patients and healthy participants using Machine Learning algorithms. In addition, the proposed approach provides insights into the brain regions affected by the disease. The functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging from the PPMI and 1000-FCP datasets were pre-processed to extract time series from 200 brain regions per participant, resulting in 11,600 features. Causal Forest and Wrapper Feature Subset Selection algorithms were used for dimensionality reduction, resulting in a subset of features based on their heterogeneity and association with the disease. We utilized Logistic Regression and XGBoost algorithms to perform PD detection, achieving 97.6% accuracy, 97.5% F1 score, 97.9% precision, and 97.7%recall by analyzing sets with fewer than 300 features in a population including men and women. Finally, Multiple Correspondence Analysis was employed to visualize the relationships between brain regions and each group (women with Parkinson, female controls, men with Parkinson, male controls). Associations between the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale questionnaire results and affected brain regions in different groups were also obtained to show another use case of the methodology. This work proposes a methodology to (1) classify patients and controls with Machine Learning and Causal Forest algorithm and (2) visualize associations between brain regions and groups, providing high-accuracy classification and enhanced interpretability of the correlation between specific brain regions and the disease across different groups.

AB  - With the continuous development of wearable sensors, it has become increasingly convenient to collect various physiological signals from the human body. The combination of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology and various physiological signals has significantly improved people's awareness of their psychological and physiological states, thus promoting substantial progress in the medical and health industries. However, most current research on physiological signal modeling does not consider the issue of interpretability, which poses a significant challenge for clinical diagnosis and treatment support. Interpretability refers to the explanation of the internal workings of AI models when generating decision results and is regarded as an important foundation for understanding model operations. Despite substantial progress made in this field in recent years, there remains a lack of systematic discussion regarding interpretable AI in physiological signal modeling, resulting in researchers having difficulty comprehensively grasping the latest developments and emerging trends in the field. Therefore, this paper provides a systematic review of interpretable AI technologies in the domain of physiological signals. Based on the scope of interpretability, these technologies are divided into two categories: global and local interpretability, and we conduct an in-depth analysis and comparison of these two types of technologies. Subsequently, we explore the potential applications of interpretable physiological signal modeling in areas such as medicine and healthcare. Finally, we summarize the key challenges of interpretable AI in the context of physiological signals and discuss future research directions. This study aims to provide researchers with a systematic framework to better understand and apply interpretable AI technologies and lay the foundation for future research.

AB  - Purpose This primer aims to serve as a foundational resource on artificial intelligence (AI) for pharmacists practicing in the emergency department (ED).Summary Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly recognized for its potential to transform healthcare, including emergency medicine (EM) and pharmacy practice. AI applications in EM include diagnostic evaluation, risk stratification, resource optimization, and therapeutic decision-making. AI's role in improving triage, diagnostics, and resource utilization in the emergency setting is discussed along with its application in the medication-use process, from prescribing to monitoring. Despite the promise of AI, significant barriers such as factual inaccuracies, ethical concerns, and data transparency prevent the widespread clinical adoption of AI tools. Challenges such as racial bias, data privacy, model transparency, and the phenomenon of hallucinations in large language model outputs are highlighted as critical considerations. AI's future success in EM will depend on responsible integration, guided by clinicians including pharmacists, and a careful consideration of ethical issues and patient-specific values.Conclusion Pharmacists practicing in the ED should be familiar with AI tools and should understand the importance of their role in the development, implementation, and oversight of these tools to ensure safe, effective, and equitable patient care.

AB  - Background Machine learning (ML) models in healthcare are crucial for predicting clinical outcomes, and their effectiveness can be significantly enhanced through improvements in accuracy, generalisability, and interpretability. To achieve widespread adoption in clinical practice, risk factors identified by these models must be validated in diverse populations.Methods In this cohort study, 86 870 community-dwelling older adults >= 65 years from the UK Biobank database were used to train and test three ML models to predict 30-day emergency hospitalisation. The three ML models, Random Forest (RF), XGBoost (XGB), and Logistic Regression (LR), utilised all extracted variables, consisting of demographic and geriatric syndromes, comorbidities, and the Drug Burden Index (DBI), a measure of potentially inappropriate polypharmacy, which quantifies exposure to medications with anticholinergic and sedative properties. 30-day emergency hospitalisation was defined as any hospitalisation related to any clinical event within 30 days of the index date. The model performance metrics included the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC-ROC) and the F1 score.Results The AUC-ROC for the RF, XGB and LR models was 0.78, 0.86 and 0.61, respectively, signifying good discriminatory power. The DBI, mobility, fractures, falls, hazardous alcohol drinking and smoking were validated as important variables in predicting 30-day emergency hospitalisation.Conclusions This study validated important risk factors for predicting 30-day emergency hospitalisation. The validation of important risk factors will inform the development of future ML studies in geriatrics. Future research should prioritise the development of targeted interventions to address the risk factors validated in this study, ultimately improving patient outcomes and alleviating healthcare burdens.

AB  - Background Critical instability forecast and treatment can be optimized by artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled clinical decision support. It is important that the user-facing display of AI output facilitates clinical thinking and workflow for all disciplines involved in bedside care.Objectives Our objective is to engage multidisciplinary users (physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants) in the development of a graphical user interface (GUI) to present an AI-derived risk score.Methods Intensive care unit (ICU) clinicians participated in focus groups seeking input on instability risk forecast presented in a prototype GUI. Two stratified rounds (three focus groups [only nurses, only providers, then combined]) were moderated by a focus group methodologist. After round 1, GUI design changes were made and presented in round 2. Focus groups were recorded, transcribed, and deidentified transcripts independently coded by three researchers. Codes were coalesced into emerging themes.Results Twenty-three ICU clinicians participated (11 nurses, 12 medical providers [3 mid-level and 9 physicians]). Six themes emerged: (1) analytics transparency, (2) graphical interpretability, (3) impact on practice, (4) value of trend synthesis of dynamic patient data, (5) decisional weight (weighing AI output during decision-making), and (6) display location (usability, concerns for patient/family GUI view). Nurses emphasized having GUI objective information to support communication and optimal GUI location. While providers emphasized need for recommendation interpretability and concern for impairing trainee critical thinking. All disciplines valued synthesized views of vital signs, interventions, and risk trends but were skeptical of placing decisional weight on AI output until proven trustworthy.Conclusion Gaining input from all clinical users is important to consider when designing AI-derived GUIs. Results highlight that health care intelligent decisional support systems technologies need to be transparent on how they work, easy to read and interpret, cause little disruption to current workflow, as well as decisional support components need to be used as an adjunct to human decision-making.

AB  - Background: During a pandemic, it is important for clinicians to stratify patients and decide who receives limited medical resources. Machine learning models have been proposed to accurately predict COVID-19 disease severity. Previous studies have typically tested only one machine learning algorithm and limited performance evaluation to area under the curve analysis. To obtain the best results possible, it may be important to test different machine learning algorithms to find the best prediction model.
   Objective: In this study, we aimed to use automated machine learning (autoML) to train various machine learning algorithms. We selected the model that best predicted patients' chances of surviving a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, we identified which variables (ie, vital signs, biomarkers, comorbidities, etc) were the most influential in generating an accurate model.
   Methods: Data were retrospectively collected from all patients who tested positive for COVID-19 at our institution between March 1 and July 3, 2020. We collected 48 variables from each patient within 36 hours before or after the index time (ie, real-time polymerase chain reaction positivity). Patients were followed for 30 days or until death. Patients' data were used to build 20 machine learning models with various algorithms via autoML. The performance of machine learning models was measured by analyzing the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPCR). Subsequently, we established model interpretability via Shapley additive explanation and partial dependence plots to identify and rank variables that drove model predictions. Afterward, we conducted dimensionality reduction to extract the 10 most influential variables. AutoML models were retrained by only using these 10 variables, and the output models were evaluated against the model that used 48 variables.
   Results: Data from 4313 patients were used to develop the models. The best model that was generated by using autoML and 48 variables was the stacked ensemble model (AUPRC=0.807). The two best independent models were the gradient boost machine and extreme gradient boost models, which had an AUPRC of 0.803 and 0.793, respectively. The deep learning model (AUPRC=0.73) was substantially inferior to the other models. The 10 most influential variables for generating high-performing models were systolic and diastolic blood pressure, age, pulse oximetry level, blood urea nitrogen level, lactate dehydrogenase level, D-dimer level, troponin level, respiratory rate, and Charlson comorbidity score. After the autoML models were retrained with these 10 variables, the stacked ensemble model still had the best performance (AUPRC=0.791).
   Conclusions: We used autoML to develop high-performing models that predicted the survival of patients with COVID-19. In addition, we identified important variables that correlated with mortality. This is proof of concept that autoML is an efficient, effective, and informative method for generating machine learning-based clinical decision support tools.

AB  - Human activity recognition (HAR) is an active research area that is currently being applied to various healthcare applications such as fall detection, assisted living, etc. These applications make use of the Internet of Things which is widespread across today's world. One of the major challenges in these applications is the need for quick intelligent decisions. The deployment of hierarchical edge-fog-cloud computing architecture is the potential solution to address the latency issue. In this article, we proposed an interpretable human activity recognition (IHAR) framework that supports HAR, leveraging the advantages of the fog layer. The proposed framework used a deep learning (DL) model at the cloud infrastructure to classify the activities of humans. The trained DL model is made to run on local fog nodes. However, the DL model being black-box does not provide any explanations for the output to make them acceptable by the users and physicians. Hence, this article also incorporated an explainable artificial intelligence model at the fog layer, to gain insights into the classified output of the DL model. The effective model-level insights emphasized the need for explainable HAR. The article also included an analysis of the results of the existing explainable AI models such as LIME and SHAP to understand which model leads to better performance in the domain of HAR. Results show that the SHAP model has a 33% higher success rate in generating explanations when compared to the LIME model.

AB  - Blockchain technology is increasingly being adopted across critical domains, such as healthcare and finance, yet it remains susceptible to anomalies and malicious attacks. Hence, robust anomaly detection is essential in these decentralized systems to maintain integrity, trust, and reliability. However, anomaly detection is still challenging due to data imbalances, adversarial resilience, and the lack of explanation in existing approaches. This work presents ARCADE, a novel approach for adversarially resilient anomaly detection in blockchain networks that leverages an optimized cost-sensitive stacking ensemble learning combined with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques. Firstly, the proposed approach uses cost-sensitive learning to address the data imbalance problem by optimizing class weights that are integrated with stacking ensemble learning to enhance detection accuracy. Secondly, along with this, newly engineered features are employed to strengthen the resilience of the model against malicious perturbations. Lastly, XAI techniques are applied to provide comprehensive insights and explanations for model prediction. To evaluate ARCADE, the Ethereum network transactions dataset is utilized to ensure a realistic case study. The experimental results show the superiority of the ARCADE in several aspects, achieving a high accuracy of 99.65%; strong resilience against adversarial perturbations, achieving an accuracy of 99.38% for low-intensity attacks, 91.04% for moderate attacks, and over 78% for extreme attacks; and surpassing existing techniques while also providing explainability for domain users.

AB  - Vitiligo is a hypopigmented skin disease characterized by the loss of melanin. The progressive nature and widespread incidence of vitiligo necessitate timely and accurate detection. Usually, a single diagnostic test often falls short of providing definitive confirmation of the condition, necessitating the assessment by dermatologists who specialize in vitiligo. However, the current scarcity of such specialized medical professionals presents a significant challenge. To mitigate this issue and enhance diagnostic accuracy, it is essential to build deep learning models that can support and expedite the detection process. This study endeavors to establish a deep learning framework to enhance the diagnostic accuracy of vitiligo. To this end, a comparative analysis of five models including ResNet (ResNet34, ResNet50, and ResNet101 models) and Swin Transformer series (Swin Transformer Base, and Swin Transformer Large models), were conducted under the uniform condition to identify the model with superior classification capabilities. Moreover, the study sought to augment the interpretability of these models by selecting one that not only provides accurate diagnostic outcomes but also offers visual cues highlighting the regions pertinent to vitiligo. The empirical findings reveal that the Swin Transformer Large model achieved the best performance in classification, whose AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity are 0.94, 93.82%, 94.02%, and 93.5%, respectively. In terms of interpretability, the highlighted regions in the class activation map correspond to the lesion regions of the vitiligo images, which shows that it effectively indicates the specific category regions associated with the decision-making of dermatological diagnosis. Additionally, the visualization of feature maps generated in the middle layer of the deep learning model provides insights into the internal mechanisms of the model, which is valuable for improving the interpretability of the model, tuning performance, and enhancing clinical applicability. The outcomes of this study underscore the significant potential of deep learning models to revolutionize medical diagnosis by improving diagnostic accuracy and operational efficiency. The research highlights the necessity for ongoing exploration in this domain to fully leverage the capabilities of deep learning technologies in medical diagnostics.

AB  - This manuscript delineates the pathway from in-house research on Artificial Intelligence (AI) to the development of a medical device, addressing critical phases including conceptualization, development, validation, and regulatory compliance. Key stages in the transformation process involve identifying clinical needs, data management, model training, and rigorous validation to ensure AI models are both robust and clinically relevant. Continuous post-deployment surveillance is essential to maintain performance and adapt to changes in clinical practice. The regulatory landscape is complex, encompassing stringent certification processes under the EU Medical Device Regulation (MDR) and the upcoming EU AI Act, which imposes additional compliance requirements aimed at mitigating AIspecific risks. Ethical considerations such as, emphasizing transparency, patient privacy, and equitable access to AI technologies, are paramount. The manuscript underscores the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration, between healthcare institutions and industry partners, and navigation of commercialization and market entry of AI devices. This overview provides a strategic framework for radiologists and healthcare leaders to effectively integrate AI into clinical practice, while adhering to regulatory and ethical standards, ultimately enhancing patient care and operational efficiency.

AB  - Quantum machine learning is a new research field combining quantum information science and machine learning. Quantum computing technologies appear to be particularly well-suited for addressing problems in the health sector efficiently. They have the potential to handle large datasets more effectively than classical models and offer greater transparency and interpretability for clinicians. Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative brain disorder that mostly affects elderly people, causing important cognitive impairments. It is the most common cause of dementia and it has an effect on memory, thought, learning abilities and movement control. This type of disease has no cure, consequently an early diagnosis is fundamental for reducing its impact. The analysis of handwriting can be effective for diagnosing, as many researches have conjectured. The DARWIN (Diagnosis AlzheimeR WIth haNdwriting) dataset contains handwriting samples from people affected by Alzheimer's disease and a group of healthy people. Here we apply quantum AI to this use-case. In particular, we use this dataset to test classical methods for classification and compare their performances with the ones obtained via quantum machine learning methods. We find that quantum methods generally perform better than classical methods. Our results pave the way for future new quantum machine learning applications in early-screening diagnostics in the healthcare domain.

AB  - Accumulating evidence demonstrates the impact of bias that reflects social inequality on the performance of machine learning (ML) models in health care. Given their intended placement within healthcare decision making more broadly, ML tools require attention to adequately quantify the impact of bias and reduce its potential to exacerbate inequalities. We suggest that taking a patient safety and quality improvement approach to bias can support the quantification of bias-related effects on ML. Drawing from the ethical principles underpinning these approaches, we argue that patient safety and quality improvement lenses support the quantification of relevant performance metrics, in order to minimize harm while promoting accountability, justice, and transparency. We identify specific methods for operationalizing these principles with the goal of attending to bias to support better decision making in light of controllable and uncontrollable factors.

It plays a crucial role in guiding treatment decisions made by physicians. This study aimed to build a stacking ensemble-based prognosis predictor model for predicting the ECOG PS of a liver cancer patient undergoing treatment.MethodsWe used Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) as the meta-model, and five base models, including Random Forest (RF), Extra Trees (ET), AdaBoost (Ada), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). After preprocessing the data and applying feature selection method, the stacking ensemble model was trained using 1622 liver cancer patients' data and 46 variables. We also integrated the stacking ensemble model with a LIME-based explainable model to obtain model prediction explainability.ResultsAccording to the research, the best combination of the stacking ensemble model is ET + XGBoost + RF + GBM + Ada + LightGBM and achieved a ROC AUC of 0.9826 on the training set and 0.9675 on the test set.ConclusionsThis explainable stacking ensemble model can become a helpful tool for objectively predicting ECOG PS in liver cancer patients and aiding healthcare practitioners to adapt their treatment approach more effectively.

AB  - Background: Tuberculosis spondylitis (TS), also known as Pott's disease, is the most common destructive form of musculoskeletal tuberculosis and poses significant clinical challenges, particularly when complicated by osteoporosis. Osteoporosis exacerbates surgical outcomes and increases the risk of complications, making its accurate prediction crucial for effective patient management. Methods: This retrospective study included 906 TS patients from two medical centers between January 2016 and November 2022. We collected demographic information and blood test data from routine examinations. To address class imbalance, the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) was applied. Feature selection was performed using LASSO, Boruta, and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to identify key predictors of osteoporosis. Multiple machine learning (ML) algorithms, including logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost, were trained and optimized using nested cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning. The optimal model was further refined through threshold tuning to enhance performance metrics. Model interpretability was achieved using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and an online web application was developed for real-time clinical use. Results: Out of 906 patients, 60 were diagnosed with osteoporosis based on Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurements. Feature selection identified hemoglobin (HB), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and cystatin C (CYS_C) as significant predictors. The logistic regression model exhibited the highest performance with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.826, which was externally validated with an AUC of 0.796. Threshold tuning optimized the decision threshold to 0.32, improving the F1-score and balancing sensitivity and specificity. SHAP analysis highlighted the critical roles of HB, eGFR, and CYS_C in osteoporosis prediction. The developed web application facilitates the model's integration into clinical workflows, enabling healthcare professionals to make informed decisions at the bedside. Conclusion: This study successfully developed and validated an ML-based tool for predicting osteoporosis in TS patients using readily available clinical data. The model demonstrated robust predictive performance and was effectively integrated into a userfriendly online application, offering a practical solution to enhance surgical decision-making and improve patient outcomes in realtime clinical settings.

TI  - Interpretable Local Concept-based Explanation with Human Feedback to Predict All-cause Mortality
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH
LA  - English
KW  - EXPLAINABLE AI
AB  - Machine learning models are incorporated in different fields and disciplines in which some of them require a high level of accountability and transparency, for example, the healthcare sector. With the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the importance for plausibility and verifiability of the predictions made by machine learning models has become essential. A widely used category of explanation techniques attempts to explain models' predictions by quantifying the importance score of each input feature. However, summarizing such scores to provide human-interpretable explanations is challenging. An-other category of explanation techniques focuses on learning a domain representation in terms of high-level human-understandable concepts and then utilizing them to explain pre-dictions. These explanations are hampered by how concepts are constructed, which is not intrinsically interpretable. To this end, we propose Concept-based Local Explanations with Feedback (CLEF), a novel local model agnostic explanation framework for learning a set of high-level transparent concept definitions in high-dimensional tabular data that uses clinician-labeled concepts rather than raw features. CLEF maps the raw input fea-tures to high-level intuitive concepts and then decompose the evidence of prediction of the instance being explained into concepts. In addition, the proposed framework generates counterfactual explanations, suggesting the minimum changes in the instance's concept -based explanation that will lead to a different prediction. We demonstrate with simulated user feedback on predicting the risk of mortality. Such direct feedback is more effective than other techniques, that rely on hand-labelled or automatically extracted concepts, in learning concepts that align with ground truth concept definitions.

AB  - Explainable Machine Learning comprises methods and techniques that enable users to better understand the machine learning functioning and results. This work proposes an ontology that represents explainable machine learning experiments, allowing data scientists and developers to have a holistic view, a better understanding of the explainable machine learning process, and to build trust. We developed the ontology by reusing an existing domain-specific ontology (ML-SCHEMA) and grounding it in the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO), aiming at achieving interoperability. The proposed ontology is structured in three modules: (1) the general module, (2) the specific module, and (3) the explanation module. The ontology was evaluated using a case study in the scenario of the COVID-19 pandemic using healthcare data from patients, which are sensitive data. In the case study, we trained a Support Vector Machine to predict mortality of patients infected with COVID-19 and applied existing explanation methods to generate explanations from the trained model. Based on the case study, we populated the ontology and queried it to ensure that it fulfills its intended purpose and to demonstrate its suitability.

AB  - As the efficacy of artificial intelligence (AI) in improving aspects of healthcare delivery is increasingly becoming evident, it becomes likely that AI will be incorporated in routine clinical care in the near future. This promise has led to growing focus and investment in AI medical applications both from governmental organizations and technological companies. However, concern has been expressed about the ethical and regulatory aspects of the application of AI in health care. These concerns include the possibility of biases, lack of transparency with certain AI algorithms, privacy concerns with the data used for training AI models, and safety and liability issues with AI application in clinical environments. While there has been extensive discussion about the ethics of AI in health care, there has been little dialogue or recommendations as to how to practically address these concerns in health care. In this article, we propose a governance model that aims to not only address the ethical and regulatory issues that arise out of the application of AI in health care, but also stimulate further discussion about governance of AI in health care.

AB  - Hip fractures in the elderly present a significant public health challenge globally, especially among patients with hypertension, who are at an increased risk of developing preoperative deep vein thrombosis (DVT). DVT not only heightens surgical risks but also severely impacts the rehabilitation and quality of life of patients. Early risk assessment and management in this population are therefore critically important. This study aimed to develop and validate a machine learning-based predictive model to enhance the accuracy of predicting preoperative DVT in elderly patients with hypertension undergoing hip fracture surgery, thereby optimizing preoperative assessment and management. A retrospective study design was employed, selecting patients with hypertension and hip fractures treated at the First Hospital of Qinhuangdao from January 2018 to December 2022. Key predictive factors were identified using LASSO regression, and logistic regression was utilized to construct both a nomogram and an online interactive nomogram. Various machine learning algorithms were also employed to build predictive models. The contribution of variables in the models was explained using SHAP values, and model performance was evaluated through ROC curves, AUC values, and other statistical methods. The study included 637 patients, with LASSO regression selecting key variables that were further used to develop a logistic regression-based nomogram and its online version, providing intuitive tools for assessing DVT incidence. Among the multiple machine learning predictive models, the LightGBM model exhibited the best performance, achieving an AUC of 0.910. The model's effectiveness and reliability were confirmed through decision curves, calibration plots, and precision-recall curves. SHAP value analysis highlighted the significance of factors such as age, time from injury to hospital admission, atrial fibrillation, C-reactive protein, hypoalbuminemia, and D-dimer levels in the predictions, enhancing the model's transparency and interpretability. This study successfully developed a logistic regression-based nomogram and multiple machine learning algorithms to predict the risk of preoperative DVT in elderly hypertensive patients with hip fractures. The nomogram provides clinicians with a practical tool for rapid risk assessment, thus optimizing patient management and prognosis. The LightGBM model, recommended for its high predictive accuracy, along with SHAP value analysis, enhanced the transparency and clinical applicability of the models. These findings not only deepen our understanding of DVT incidence factors but also demonstrate the potential of machine learning technologies in enhancing medical decision-making and advancing precision medicine.

AB  - The advancements in data acquisition, storage, and processing techniques have resulted in the rapid growth of heterogeneous medical data. Integrating radiological scans, histopathology images, and molecular information with clinical data is essential for developing a holistic understanding of the disease and optimizing treatment. The need for integrating data from multiple sources is further pronounced in complex diseases such as cancer for enabling precision medicine and personalized treatments. This work proposes Multimodal Integration of Oncology Data System (MINDS)-a flexible, scalable, and cost-effective metadata framework for efficiently fusing disparate data from public sources such as the Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC) into an interconnected, patient-centric framework. MINDS consolidates over 41,000 cases from across repositories while achieving a high compression ratio relative to the 3.78 PB source data size. It offers sub-5-s query response times for interactive exploration. MINDS offers an interface for exploring relationships across data types and building cohorts for developing large-scale multimodal machine learning models. By harmonizing multimodal data, MINDS aims to potentially empower researchers with greater analytical ability to uncover diagnostic and prognostic insights and enable evidence-based personalized care. MINDS tracks granular end-to-end data provenance, ensuring reproducibility and transparency. The cloud-native architecture of MINDS can handle exponential data growth in a secure, cost-optimized manner while ensuring substantial storage optimization, replication avoidance, and dynamic access capabilities. Auto-scaling, access controls, and other mechanisms guarantee pipelines' scalability and security. MINDS overcomes the limitations of existing biomedical data silos via an interoperable metadata-driven approach that represents a pivotal step toward the future of oncology data integration.

AB  - The recent emergence of publically facing artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots has generated vigorous discussion in the lay public around the possibilities, liabilities, and uncertainties of the integration of such technology into everyday life. As primary care clinicians continue to struggle against ever-increasing loads of asynchronous, electronic work, the potential for AI to improve the quality and efficiency of this work looms large. In this essay, we discuss the basic premise of open-access AI chatbots such as CHATGPT, review prior applications of AI in healthcare, and preview some possible AI chatbot-assisted in-basket assistance including scenarios of communicating test results with patients, providing patient education, and clinical decision support in history taking, review of prior diagnostic test characteristics, and common management scenarios. We discuss important concerns related to the future adoption of this technology including the transparency of the training data used in developing these models, the level of oversight and trustworthiness of the information generated, and possible impacts on equity, bias, and patient privacy. A stepwise and balanced approach to simultaneously understand the capabilities and address the concerns associated with these tools will be needed before these tools can improve patient care.

AB  - Healthcare, one of the most important industries, is data-oriented, but most of the research in this industry focuses on incorporating the internet of things (IoT) or connecting medical equipment. Very few researchers are looking at the data generated in the healthcare industry. Data are very important tools in this competitive world, as they can be integrated with artificial intelligence (AI) to promote sustainability. Healthcare data include the health records of patients, drug-related data, clinical trials data, data from various medical equipment, etc. Most of the data management processes are manual, time-consuming, and error-prone. Even then, different healthcare industries do not trust each other to share and collaborate on data. Distributed ledger technology is being used for innovations in different sectors including healthcare. This technology can be incorporated to maintain and exchange data between different healthcare organizations, such as hospitals, insurance companies, laboratories, pharmacies, etc. Various attributes of this technology, such as its immutability, transparency, provenance etc., can bring trust and security to the domain of the healthcare sector. In this paper, a decentralized access control model is proposed to enable the secure interoperability of different healthcare organizations. This model uses the Ethereum blockchain for its implementation. This model interfaces patients, doctors, chemists, and insurance companies, empowering the consistent and secure exchange of data. The major concerns are maintaining a history of the transactions and avoiding unauthorized updates in health records. Any transaction that changes the state of the data is reflected in the distributed ledger and can be easily traced with this model. Only authorized entities can access their respective data. Even the administrator will not be able to modify any medical records.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is gaining widespread traction in ophthalmology, with multiple screening and diagnostic tools already being approved by U. S. and EU authorities. However, the adoption of these tools among medical professionals and their acceptance among patients is still questionable. This narrative review analyses the current literature on stakeholder perspectives on the integration of AI in ophthalmology, with a focus on comparing views across different global healthcare contexts. A PubMed search was conducted for original research articles published between January 1, 2015 and August 31, 2024. The analysis revealed different levels of acceptance for different AI applications among different stakeholder groups. Ophthalmologists and optometrists generally showed positive attitudes toward AI as an adjunct tool, while patients expressed mixed views, appreciating potential benefits while expressing concerns about a lack of transparency in the integration of AI into healthcare. This review reveals a complex landscape of stakeholder perspectives on AI in ophthalmology, highlighting the need for tailored approaches to AI implementation that address specific concerns and consider different healthcare contexts. The findings underscore the importance of collaborative efforts to develop context-specific, effective AI solutions in ophthalmology.

AB  - Decision-making in healthcare relies on understanding patients' past and current health states to predict and, ultimately, change their future course1, 2-3. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods promise to aid this task by learning patterns of disease progression from large corpora of health records4,5. However, their potential has not been fully investigated at scale. Here we modify the GPT6 (generative pretrained transformer) architecture to model the progression and competing nature of human diseases. We train this model, Delphi-2M, on data from 0.4 million UK Biobank participants and validate it using external data from 1.9 million Danish individuals with no change in parameters. Delphi-2M predicts the rates of more than 1,000 diseases, conditional on each individual's past disease history, with accuracy comparable to that of existing single-disease models. Delphi-2M's generative nature also enables sampling of synthetic future health trajectories, providing meaningful estimates of potential disease burden for up to 20 years, and enabling the training of AI models that have never seen actual data. Explainable AI methods7 provide insights into Delphi-2M's predictions, revealing clusters of co-morbidities within and across disease chapters and their time-dependent consequences on future health, but also highlight biases learnt from training data. In summary, transformer-based models appear to be well suited for predictive and generative health-related tasks, are applicable to population-scale datasets and provide insights into temporal dependencies between disease events, potentially improving the understanding of personalized health risks and informing precision medicine approaches.

AB  - Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) is the dominant cause of mortality around the world. Every year, it causes about 3.9 million deaths in Europe and 1.8 million in the European Union (EU). It is responsible for 45 % and 37 % of all deaths in Europe and the European Union, respectively. Using machine learning (ML) to predict heart diseases is one of the most promising research topics, as it can improve healthcare and consequently increase the longevity of people 's lives. However, although the ability to interpret the results of the predictive model is essential, most of the related studies do not propose explainable methods. To address this problem, this paper presents a classification method that not only exhibits reliable performance but is also interpretable, ensuring transparency in its decision-making process. SHapley Additive exPlanations, known as the SHAP method was chosen for model interpretability. This approach presents a comparison between different classifiers and parameter tuning techniques, providing all the details necessary to replicate the experiment and help future researchers working in the field. The proposed model achieves similar performance to those proposed in the literature, and its predictions are fully interpretable.

AB  - Enabling precision medicine requires developing robust patient stratification methods as well as drugs tailored to homogeneous subgroups of patients from a heterogeneous population. Developing de novo drugs is expensive and time consuming with an ultimately low FDA approval rate. These limitations make developing new drugs for a small portion of a disease population unfeasible. Therefore, drug repositioning is an essential alternative for developing new drugs for a disease subpopulation. This shows the importance of developing data-driven approaches that find druggable homogeneous subgroups within the disease population and reposition the drugs for these subgroups. In this study, we developed an explainable AI approach for patient stratification and drug repositioning. Contrast pattern mining and network analysis were used to discover homogeneous subgroups within a disease population. For each subgroup, a biomedical network analysis was done to find the drugs that are most relevant to a given subgroup of patients. The set of candidate drugs for each subgroup was ranked using an aggregated drug score assigned to each drug. The proposed method represents a human-in-the-loop framework, where medical experts use the data-driven results to generate hypotheses and obtain insights into potential therapeutic candidates for patients who belong to a subgroup. Colorectal cancer (CRC) was used as a case study. Patients' phenotypic and genotypic data was utilized with a heterogeneous knowledge base because it gives a multi-view perspective for finding new indications for drugs outside of their original use. Our analysis of the top candidate drugs for the subgroups identified by medical experts showed that most of these drugs are cancerrelated, and most of them have the potential to be a CRC regimen based on studies in the literature.

AB  - PurposeRecent breakthroughs in natural language processing and machine learning, exemplified by ChatGPT, have spurred a paradigm shift in healthcare. Released by OpenAI in November 2022, ChatGPT rapidly gained global attention. Trained on massive text datasets, this large language model holds immense potential to revolutionize healthcare. However, existing literature often overlooks the need for rigorous validation and real-world applicability.MethodsThis head-to-head comparative study assesses ChatGPT's capabilities in providing therapeutic recommendations for head and neck cancers. Simulating every NCCN Guidelines scenarios. ChatGPT is queried on primary treatments, adjuvant treatment, and follow-up, with responses compared to the NCCN Guidelines. Performance metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score, are employed for assessment.ResultsThe study includes 68 hypothetical cases and 204 clinical scenarios. ChatGPT exhibits promising capabilities in addressing NCCN-related queries, achieving high sensitivity and overall accuracy across primary treatment, adjuvant treatment, and follow-up. The study's metrics showcase robustness in providing relevant suggestions. However, a few inaccuracies are noted, especially in primary treatment scenarios.ConclusionOur study highlights the proficiency of ChatGPT in providing treatment suggestions. The model's alignment with the NCCN Guidelines sets the stage for a nuanced exploration of AI's evolving role in oncological decision support. However, challenges related to the interpretability of AI in clinical decision-making and the importance of clinicians understanding the underlying principles of AI models remain unexplored. As AI continues to advance, collaborative efforts between models and medical experts are deemed essential for unlocking new frontiers in personalized cancer care.

AB  - The transformation of communication media has revolutionized social interactions, incorporating audio and video into our lives. Despite the recent availability of virtual reality (VR) technology, its widespread adoption faces obstacles. Technological challenges in creating VR environments and scientific confounding concerning interindividual variability in responses to virtual simulations are key factors hindering its broader integration. The EXPERIENCE project makes real the complex interplay among multisensory perception, emotional responses, and extended social interactions by allowing the public-at-large to create their own VR environments automatically through portable devices (e.g., smartphones/tablets) without the need for technical skills. The VR environment augmented by an individual's physiological responses, psychological and cognitive descriptors, and behavioral outcomes defines the individual's subjective experience, namely, an individual's extended personal reality (EPR). The virtualization of a person's EPR provides a holistic and quantitative environment that can be shared with others to transfer personalized psychological and emotional responses. Additionally, EPR assessment enables subsequent manipulation of the VR through explainable artificial intelligence (AI) routines merging multisensory biofeedback, individualized perception of time-space, and neuromodulation. This technology can be exploited in a plethora of innovative scenarios, including mental healthcare, gaming, e-learning, and neuroeconomics, also leading to the creation of a new market for sharing and selling (virtual) experiences.

AB  - Our aging society claims for innovative tools to early detect symptoms of cognitive decline. Several research efforts are being made to exploit sensorized smart-homes and artificial intelligence (AI) methods to detect a decline of the cognitive functions of the elderly in order to promptly alert practitioners. Even though those tools may provide accurate predictions, they currently provide limited support to clinicians in making a diagnosis. Indeed, most AI systems do not provide any explanation of the reason why a given prediction was computed. Other systems are based on a set of rules that are easy to interpret by a human. However, those rule-based systems can cope with a limited number of abnormal situations, and are not flexible enough to adapt to different users and contextual situations. In this paper, we tackle this challenging problem by proposing a flexible AI system to recognize early symptoms of cognitive decline in smart-homes, which is able to explain the reason of predictions at a fine-grained level. Our method relies on well known clinical indicators that consider subtle and overt behavioral anomalies, as well as spatial disorientation and wandering behaviors. In order to adapt to different individuals and situations, anomalies are recognized using a collaborative approach. We experimented our approach with a large set of real world subjects, including people with MCI and people with dementia. We also implemented a dashboard to allow clinicians to inspect anomalies together with the explanations of predictions. Results show that our system's predictions are significantly correlated to the person's actual diagnosis. Moreover, a preliminary user study with clinicians suggests that the explanation capabilities of our system are useful to improve the task performance and to increase trust. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that explores data-driven explainable AI for supporting the diagnosis of cognitive decline. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status is a widely used method for evaluating the functional abilities of cancer patients and predicting their prognosis. It is essential for healthcare providers to frequently assess the ECOG performance status of lung cancer patients to ensure that it accurately reflects their current functional abilities and to modify their treatment plan accordingly. This study aimed to develop and evaluate an AdaBoost classification (ADB-C) model to predict a lung cancer patient's performance status following treatment. According to the results, the ADB-C model has the highest "Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve" (ROC AUC) score at 0.7890 which outperformed other benchmark models including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, and TabNet. In order to achieve model prediction explainability, we combined the ADB-C model with a LIME-based explainable model. This explainable ADB-C model may assist medical professionals in exploring effective cancer treatments that would not negatively impact the post-treatment performance status of a patient.

AB  - Introduction The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into transplant surgery offers potential benefits, including enhanced precision and personalized patient care. However, these advancements raise critical ethical issues that must be addressed to ensure responsible implementation. This scoping review and bibliometric analysis explore the literature on the ethical considerations associated with the application of AI in transplant surgery.Methods Following Joanna Briggs Institute and PRISMA-ScR guidelines, we conducted a systematic search of databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, JSTOR, LILACS, IEEE, and GreyNet from 2013 to 2025. We identified articles that discussed ethical implications in English or Spanish. Data were charted using Rayyan (Rayyan Systems Inc., Doha, Qatar) and analyzed with Biblioshiny. One reviewer reviewed each article twice to ensure accuracy.Results Our search identified 6824 records, of which 16 studies met the selection criteria. The bibliometric analysis revealed a significant increase in scholarly output on AI ethics in transplantation since 2020. Key ethical concerns comprehend dehumanization of medical care, limitations in AI interpretability, and erroneous decision-making. The potential benefits highlighted include improved donor-recipient matching and personalized patient care. However, the need for human oversight in AI applications is emphasized mitigating risks such as patient dehumanization and biased decision-making.Conclusion This review is the first to comprehensively map the ethical landscape of AI integration in transplant surgery. It identifies both the potential and the significant ethical challenges of these technologies. Future research should focus on developing frameworks for ethical AI implementation and ensuring that advancements in AI contribute to equitable and just healthcare practices.

AB  - Diabetes is one of the most widespread chronic diseases worldwide, affecting millions and posing significant health risks. Effective management depends on early detection and risk assessment, enabling medical professionals to take timely action and mitigate long-term healthcare consequences. However, there is a critical need for a reliable and accurate detection system to support medical professionals in clinical and computational assessments. Existing detection systems, particularly those based on traditional deep learning models, often fail to address challenges such as class imbalance, the inability to model non-linear patterns, high annotation costs, and the lack of explainability inherent in black-box models. To address these challenges in diabetes prediction, this study applies the proximity weighted synthetic oversampling technique to resolve class imbalance issues in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset, ensuring a balanced representation of healthy and diabetic individuals. Subsequently, we propose a novel Diabetic Class-based Sampling Pointer Network (DCSPNetwork) for early diabetes prediction by assessing high-risk factors. The DCSPNetwork effectively captures non-linear patterns in the BRFSS dataset, reduces overfitting risks, and minimizes labeling costs. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of DCSPNetwork, achieving an improvement score of 5.88% in accuracy, 8.14% in precision, 9.76% in recall, 8.33% in F1-score, and 4.3% in area under the receiver operating characteristics curve score, and a remarkable decrease of 30.3% in log loss, 72.90% in training time, and 30.30% in inference time compared to its benchmark pointer network model. Using a 10-fold cross-validation approach, we verified the performance and generalizability of our DCSPNetwork, ensuring consistent results across various data splits and demonstrating its robustness. To further support the DCSPNetwork's efficacy and dependability, statistical validation is carried out utilizing a t-test and a 95% confidence interval. We incorporated explainable artificial intelligence techniques, local interpretable model-agnostic explanations, and Shapley additive explanations to enhance interpretability and transparency in predictions. These techniques improved the reliability of our model and offered insightful information about feature contributions in DCSPNetwork's predictions. The results indicate that DCSPNetwork is a reliable and effective model for early diabetes risk assessment, combining high performance with interpretability.

AB  - Background and Objective: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has significantly advanced medical imaging, yet the opacity of deep learning models remains challenging, often reducing the trust of medical professionals towards AI-driven diagnoses. As a result, there is a strong focus on making AI models more transparent and interpretable to boost healthcare providers' confidence in these technologies. Methods: This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance AI explainability in critical medical tasks by integrating state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models with atlas-based mapping and Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce comprehensive, human-readable medical reports. The proposed framework ensures that the generated outputs are factual and contextually rich. Our anti-hallucination design, which combines structured JSON with prompt constraints, is a critical innovation compared to most na & iuml;ve LLM report generation methods, thereby enhancing the transparency and interpretability of AI systems. Results: Experimental results show that the SegResNet model achieves high segmentation accuracy, while LLMs (Gemma, Llama, and Mistral) demonstrate diverse strengths in generating explanatory reports. Numerous metrics have been employed to assess the quality and effectiveness of generated textual explanations, such as lexical diversity, readability, coherence, and information coverage. Conclusions: The method has been specifically tested for brain tumor detection in glioma, one of the most aggressive forms of cancer, and subsequently applied to multiple sclerosis lesion detection to further validate its generalizability across various medical imaging scenarios, thereby contributing to the trustworthiness of healthcare AI applications. Reproducibility: The complete source code for implementing the framework and reproducing the results is publicly available, along with full pipeline examples demonstrating each step-from segmentation to report generation-at the following repository: https://github.com/albertovalerio/from-segmentation-to-explanation.

AB  - Early diagnosis of diabetes is crucial for effective management and prevention of complications. However, traditional diagnostic methods are often constrained by the complexity of clinical datasets. To this end, this study proposes a novel explainable machine learning (ML) framework to enhance diabetes prediction. Specifically, the developed methodology involves the detection of outliers using local outlier factor and data reconstruction through a sparse autoencoder. Subsequently, multiple imputation strategies are employed to effectively address missing or erroneous data, while the synthetic minority oversampling technique is applied to mitigate class imbalance. Afterward, a stacking ensemble model, consisting of seven base ML models, is developed for classification, and the outputs of these base models are aggregated using four meta models. To enhance interpretability, two layers of model explainability are implemented. Feature importance analysis is conducted to identify the significance of input variables and Shapley additive explanations is employed to assess the contribution of each base model to the meta model predictions. The results demonstrated that replacing missing data with zeros or mean values led to a noticeable decrease inaccuracy compared to Knearest neighbor imputation or removing samples. Notably, hypertension and kidney failure are pivotal features in the diabetes diagnosis process. Among the base models, Extra Trees model had the most significant impact on the meta model decisions. The stacking multi-layer perceptron model achieved the highest accuracy of 92.54% for diabetes detection, surpassing the performance of standalone ML techniques. This approach enhances diagnostic precision and provides transparency in model predictions, essential for clinical applications.

AB  - Tactile edge technology that focuses on 5G or beyond 5G reveals an exciting approach to control infectious diseases such as COVID-19 internationally. The control of epidemics such as COVID-19 can be managed effectively by exploiting edge computation through the 5G wireless connectivity network. The implementation of a hierarchical edge computing system provides many advantages, such as low latency, scalability, and the protection of application and training model data, enabling COVID-19 to be evaluated by a dependable local edge server. In addition, many deep learning (DL) algorithms suffer from two crucial disadvantages: first, training requires a large COVID-19 dataset consisting of various aspects, which will pose challenges for local councils; second, to acknowledge the outcome, the findings of deep learning require ethical acceptance and clarification by the health care sector, as well as other contributors. In this article, we propose a B5G framework that utilizes the 5G network's low-latency, high-bandwidth functionality to detect COVID-19 using chest X-ray or CT scan images, and to develop a mass surveillance system to monitor social distancing, mask wearing, and body temperature. Three DL models, ResNet50, Deep tree, and Inception v3, are investigated in the proposed framework. Furthermore, blockchain technology is also used to ensure the security of healthcare data.

AB  - This study delves into hospital mobility within the Italian regions of Apulia and Emilia-Romagna, interpreting it as an indicator of perceived service quality. Utilizing logistic regression alongside other machine learning techniques, we analyze the impact of structural, operational, and clinical variables on patient perceptions of quality, thus influencing their healthcare choices. The analysis of mobility trends has uncovered significant regional differences, emphasizing how the regional context shapes perceived service quality. To further enhance the analysis, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values have been integrated into the logistic regression model. These values quantify the specific contributions of each variable to the perceived quality of service, significantly improving the interpretability and fairness of evaluations. A methodological innovation of this study is the use of these SHAP impact scores as weights in the data envelopment analysis (DEA), facilitating a comparative efficiency analysis of healthcare facilities that is both weighted and normative. The combination of logistic regression and SHAP-weighted DEA provides a deeper understanding of perceived quality dynamics and offers essential insights for optimizing the distribution of healthcare resources. This approach underscores the importance of data-driven strategies to develop more equitable, efficient, and patient-centered healthcare systems. This research significantly contributes to the understanding of perceived quality dynamics within the healthcare context and promotes further investigations to enhance service accessibility and quality, leveraging machine learning as a tool to increase the efficiency of healthcare services across diverse regional settings. These findings are pivotal for policymakers and healthcare system managers aiming to reduce regional disparities and promote a more responsive and personalized healthcare service.

AB  - Background: Clinical decision support systems leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) are increasingly integrated into health care practices, including pharmacy medication verification. Communicating uncertainty in an AI prediction is viewed as an important mechanism for boosting human collaboration and trust. Yet, little is known about the effects on human cognition as a result of interacting with such types of AI advice. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the cognitive interaction patterns of pharmacists during medication product verification when using an AI prototype. Moreover, we examine the impact of AI's assistance, both helpful and unhelpful, and the communication of uncertainty of AI-generated results on pharmacists' cognitive interaction with the prototype. Methods: In a randomized controlled trial, 30 pharmacists from professional networks each performed 200 medication verification tasks while their eye movements were recorded using an online eye tracker. Participants completed 100 verifications without AI assistance and 100 with AI assistance (either with black box help without uncertainty information or uncertainty-aware help, which displays AI uncertainty). Fixation patterns (first and last areas fixated, number of fixations, fixation duration, and dwell times) were analyzed in relation to AI help type and helpfulness. Results: Pharmacists shifted 19%-26% of their total fixations to AI-generated regions when these were available, suggesting the integration of AI advice in decision-making. AI assistance did not reduce the number of fixations on fill images, which remained the primary focus area. Unhelpful AI advice led to longer dwell times on reference and fill images, indicating increased cognitive processing. Displaying AI uncertainty led to longer cognitive processing times as measured by dwell times in original images. Conclusions:Unhelpful AI increases cognitive processing time in the original images. Transparency in AI is needed in "black box" systems, but showing more information can add a cognitive burden. Therefore, the communication of uncertainty should be optimized and integrated into clinical workflows using user-centered design to avoid increasing cognitive load or impeding clinicians' original workflow.

AB  - Predicting the response of a cancer cell line to a therapeutic drug is pivotal for personalized medicine. Despite numerous deep learning methods that have been developed for drug response prediction, integrating diverse information about biological entities and predicting the directional response remain major challenges. Here, we propose a novel interpretable predictive model, DRExplainer, which leverages a directed graph convolutional network to enhance the prediction in a directed bipartite network framework. DRExplainer constructs a directed bipartite network integrating multi-omics profiles of cell lines, the chemical structure of drugs and known drug response to achieve directed prediction. Then, DRExplainer identifies the most relevant subgraph to each prediction in this directed bipartite network by learning a mask, facilitating critical medical decision-making. Additionally, we introduce a quantifiable method for model interpretability that leverages a ground truth benchmark dataset curated from biological features. In computational experiments, DRExplainer outperforms state-of-the-art predictive methods and another graph-based explanation method under the same experimental setting. Finally, the case studies further validate the interpretability and the effectiveness of DRExplainer in predictive novel drug response. Our code is available at: https://github.com/vshy-dream/ DRExplainer.

AB  - The integration of artificial intelligence into healthcare, particularly in mammography, holds immense potential for improving breast cancer diagnosis. Artificial intelligence (AI), with its ability to process vast amounts of data and detect intricate patterns, offers a solution to the limitations of traditional mammography, including missed diagnoses and false positives. This review focuses on the diagnostic accuracy of AI-assisted mammography, synthesizing findings from studies across different clinical settings and algorithms. The motivation for this research lies in addressing the need for enhanced diagnostic tools in breast cancer screening, where early detection can significantly impact patient outcomes. Although AI models have shown promising improvements in sensitivity and specificity, challenges such as algorithmic bias, interpretability, and the generalizability of models across diverse populations remain. The review concludes that while AI holds transformative potential in breast cancer screening, collaborative efforts between radiologists, AI developers, and policymakers are crucial for ensuring ethical, reliable, and inclusive integration into clinical practice.

AB  - Securing Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) is one of the most critical applications of cryptography over the Internet due to the value and importance of data contained in such EMRs. Although blockchain-based healthcare systems can provide security, privacy, and immutability to EMRs, several outstanding security and latency issues are associated with existing schemes. For example, some researchers have used the blockchain as a storage tool which increases delay and adversely affects the blockchain performance since it stores a copy of each transaction. A distributed ledger also requires appropriate space and computational power with increased data size. In addition, existing healthcare-based approaches usually rely on centralized servers connected to clouds, which are vulnerable to denial of service (DoS), distributed DoS (DDoS), and collusion attacks. This paper proposes a novel hybrid-deep learning-based homomorphic encryption (HE) model for the Industrial Internet of Medical Things (IIoMT) to cope with such challenges using a consortium blockchain. Integrating HE with the proposed IIoMT system is a vital contribution of this work. The use of HE while outsourcing to the cloud the storage provides a unique facility to perform any statistical and machine learning operation on the encrypted EMR data, hence providing resistance to collusion and phishing attacks. Our proposed model uses a pre-trained hybrid deep learning model in the cloud and deploys the trained model into blockchain-based edge devices in order to classify and train local models using EMRs. This is further conditioned on the private data of each edge and IoT device connected with the consortium blockchain. All local models obtained are aggregated to the cloud to update a global model, which is finally disseminated to the edge nodes. Our proposed approach provides more privacy and security than conventional models and can deliver high efficiency and low end-to-end latency for users. Comparative simulation analysis with state-of-the-art approaches is carried out using benchmark performance metrics, which show that our proposed model provides enhanced security, efficiency, and transparency.

AB  - BackgroundDevice-related pressure injury (DRPI) is a prevalent and severe problem for patients using medical devices. Timely identification of patients at high risk of DRPI is crucial for healthcare providers to make informed decisions and prevent DRPI quickly. Given the rapid advancements in computer technology, we aimed to develop an interpretable artificial intelligence (AI) model for predicting DRPI, utilizing SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to enhance the model's transparency and provide insights into feature importance.MethodsWe enrolled 675 study subjects (225 in the DRPI group and 450 in the non-DRPI group) from a single medical center between January 2019 and December 2020. Python was used to perform classification models, including extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), Logistic Regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and K-Nearest neighbors (KNN). We evaluated the performance of the six models using area under the ROC curve (AUC), specificity, accuracy, and sensitivity, with the dataset split into a 80% training set and a 20% testing set. We utilized several analyses, such as SHAP and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), to explore the potential contribution of different characteristics in our risk prediction models.ResultsIn the test set, XGBoost model outperformed the other models (AUC = 0.964). The interpretation of the model using SHAPscores revealed that the length of stay, instrument type, emergency admissions, instrument material, and instrument duration of use are the top five most important features in predicting DRPI.ConclusionOur study demonstrated that the development of DRPI in patients can be accurately predicted using the machine learning (ML) model. The findings not only provide clinical caregivers with a valuable framework to identify patients at high risk of DRPI, but also lay the groundwork for developing targeted preventive strategies and personalized interventions.

TI  - MuTATE-an R package for comprehensive multi-objective molecular modeling
T2  - BIOINFORMATICS
LA  - English
AB  - Motivation Comprehensive multi-omics studies have driven advances in disease modeling for effective precision medicine but pose a challenge for existing machine-learning approaches, which have limited interpretability across clinical endpoints. Automated, comprehensive disease modeling requires a machine-learning approach that can simultaneously identify disease subgroups and their defining molecular biomarkers by explaining multiple clinical endpoints. Current tools are restricted to individual endpoints or limited variable types, necessitate advanced computation skills, and require resource-intensive manual expert interpretation.Results We developed Multi-Target Automated Tree Engine (MuTATE) for automated and comprehensive molecular modeling, which enables user-friendly multi-objective decision tree construction and visualization of relationships between molecular biomarkers and patient subgroups characterized by multiple clinical endpoints. MuTATE incorporates multiple targets throughout model construction and allows for target weights, enabling construction of interpretable decision trees that provide insights into disease heterogeneity and molecular signatures. MuTATE eliminates the need for manual synthesis of multiple non-explainable models, making it highly efficient and accessible for bioinformaticians and clinicians. The flexibility and versatility of MuTATE make it applicable to a wide range of complex diseases, including cancer, where it can improve therapeutic decisions by providing comprehensive molecular insights for precision medicine. MuTATE has the potential to transform biomarker discovery and subtype identification, leading to more effective and personalized treatment strategies in precision medicine, and advancing our understanding of disease mechanisms at the molecular level.Availability and implementation MuTATE is freely available at GitHub (https://github.com/SarahAyton/MuTATE) under the GPLv3 license.

AB  - In alignment with the scope in Computer Science, which emphasizes intelligent systems and human-centric computing, this study addresses the critical gap in clinically interpretable, physiologically grounded modeling for patient-specific decision support. Conventional computational approaches to esophageal care often rely on static classifiers or linear regressions that lack adaptability, multimodal integration, and physiological interpretability, limiting their deployment in real-time clinical workflows. Moreover, they typically disregard structural constraints intrinsic to the esophagus, resulting in clinically implausible outputs and reduced generalizability across diverse patient populations. An integrated approach combining the Structured Esophageal Dynamics Network (SED-Net) with a Domain-guided Esophageal Adaptation Strategy (DEAS) is developed to tackle prevailing limitations in modeling esophageal dynamics. SED-Net is a modular neural architecture designed to capture the topological and temporal intricacies of esophageal dynamics using graph-based spatial encoding, constrained temporal recurrence, and structure-aware decoding. Complementarily, DEAS injects domain knowledge through physiological constraint regularization, topological flow preservation, hierarchical attention calibration, and patient-specific adaptive feedback. This hybrid system aligns with key of the journal such as biomedical informatics, adaptive systems, and machine learning interpretability. Experimental evaluations demonstrate significant improvements in predictive accuracy, anatomical coherence, and cross-patient generalization, positioning the proposed framework as a promising advancement in computational health informatics for dynamic esophageal assessment and intervention.

AB  - Cytokine release syndrome (CRS), also known as cytokine storm, is one of the most consequential adverse effects of chimeric antigen receptor therapies that have shown otherwise promising results in cancer treatment. When emerging, CRS could be identified by the analysis of specific cytokine and chemokine profiles that tend to exhibit similarities across patients. In this paper, we exploit these similarities using machine learning algorithms and set out to pioneer a meta-review informed method for the identification of CRS based on specific cytokine peak concentrations and evidence from previous clinical studies. To this end we also address a widespread challenge of the applicability of machine learning in general: reduced training data availability. We do so by augmenting available (but often insufficient) patient cytokine concentrations with statistical knowledge extracted from domain literature. We argue that such methods could support clinicians in analyzing suspect cytokine profiles by matching them against the said CRS knowledge from past clinical studies, with the ultimate aim of swift CRS diagnosis. We evaluate our proposed methods under several design choices, achieving performance of more than 90% in terms of CRS identification accuracy, and showing that many of our choices outperform a purely data-driven alternative. During evaluation with real-world CRS clinical data, we emphasize the potential of our proposed method of producing interpretable results, in addition to being effective in identifying the onset of cytokine storm.

AB  - The accurate location of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) is important for the design of synthetic biology components and the realization of precision medicine. Despite the growing use of deep learning for TFBSs prediction, model interpretability remains challenging. We introduce DeepUTF, a novel architecture integrating improved encoder-decoder, swin transformer, and parallel Bi-LSTM, which realizes precise localization of TFBSs and prediction of motifs. We elucidate the effectiveness of the swin transformer in capturing a wide range of dependencies and emphasizing the learning of critical features. Meanwhile, interpretability analysis of the model's output and predictions of TF-DNA binding motifs are conducted, providing a thorough exploration of the model's intrinsic mechanisms and feature learning process. Experiments conducted on 53 ChIP-seq datasets illustrate that DeepUTF surpasses several leading algorithms. The trained model accurately predicts direct and indirect TF-DNA binding motifs. Furthermore, comparisons with the PDB database validate the continuity and accuracy of predictions.

AB  - "One person's data or experience is another person's information" this has become the golden rule of the 21st century which has resulted in a massive reservoir of data and immense amounts of information generation. However, there is no control over the source of this information, accessibility of this information, or the quality of it, which has given rise to the presence of "misinformation." The research community has reacted by proposing frameworks and difficulties, which are helpful for (different subtasks of) recognizing misinformation. Most of these frameworks, however, fail to consider all the aspects that can contribute to making information "credible". Furthermore, a valid explanation for each considered feature's contribution to the model's decision stands missing in most work. With this in mind, the authors have attempted to produce a system that yields highly accurate decisions, thus effectively separating credible health blogs from their non-credible counterparts while providing valid user-friendly explanations. The study proposes an Explainable AI-assisted Multimodal Credibility Assessment System that examines the credibility of the platform where the blog is hosted, the credibility of the author of the blog and the credibility of the images that contribute to the blog. This novel framework contributes to the existing body of knowledge by assessing the credibility of misleading beauty blogs using multiple crucial modalities which would lead to an insightful information consumption by the users. The proposed pipeline was successfully implemented on multiple carefully curated datasets and correctly identified 274 non credible blogs out of 321 blogs with an accuracy of 97.5%, Precision of 0.973 & F1score of 0.986. Further, the Explainable AI model, with the help of several visualizations displayed the feature contributions for each blog & it's impact and magnitude in a concise comprehensible format. The framework can be further customized and applied to various domains where presence of misinformation is of high concern such as pharmaceutical drug information, pandemic management, financial advisories, online healthcare services and cyber frauds.

AB  - In the rapidly advancing landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) within integrative health care (IHC), the issue of data ownership has become pivotal. This study explores the intricate dynamics of data ownership in the context of IHC and the AI era, presenting the novel Collaborative Healthcare Data Ownership (CHDO) framework. The analysis delves into the multifaceted nature of data ownership, involving patients, providers, researchers, and AI developers, and addresses challenges such as ambiguous consent, attribution of insights, and international inconsistencies. Examining various ownership models, including privatization and communization postulates, as well as distributed access control, data trusts, and blockchain technology, the study assesses their potential and limitations. The proposed CHDO framework emphasizes shared ownership, defined access and control, and transparent governance, providing a promising avenue for responsible and collaborative AI integration in IHC. This comprehensive analysis offers valuable insights into the complex landscape of data ownership in IHC and the AI era, potentially paving the way for ethical and sustainable advancements in data-driven health care.

The primary objectives are to precisely forecast the need for medical supplies, ensure that the right supplies are on hand when required, optimise delivery routes, and foster trust and openness in the movement of medical supplies across the supply chain. This paper offers novel ideas for using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks to transform healthcare supply chain management. Using complex data patterns, Krill Herd Optimization (CGANs-KHO) is presented as a potent technique for very precise medical supply-demand predictions. The supply chain procedures are smoothly linked with Enhanced Q-learning with Genetic Algorithms (EQL-GA), guaranteeing accurate medical supply stocking across a range of healthcare institutions. Dijkstra's algorithm is used to optimize delivery routes, ensuring that medical supplies are moved between the central warehouse and other healthcare institutions in a timely and effective manner. Proof of Authority (PoA)-enabled private blockchains increase trust and transparency in the supply chain. Using smart contracts to automate safe supply chain agreements, this blockchain monitors the transfer of medical supplies. This increases stakeholder trust and validates transactions. The performance measures, which include Demand, Inventory level, Route, Time against Quality of Medical Supplies, and Transaction versus Transparency.

AB  - Exosomes, as next-generation biomarkers, has great potential in tracking cancer progression. They face many detection limitations in cancer diagnosis. Plasmonic biosensors have attracted considerable attention at the forefront of exosome detection, due to their label-free, real-time, and high-sensitivity features. Their advantages in multiplex immunoassays of minimal liquid samples establish the leading position in various diagnostic studies. This review delineates the application principles of plasmonic sensing technologies, highlighting the importance of exosomes-based spectrum and image signals in disease diagnostics. It also introduces advancements in miniaturizing plasmonic biosensing platforms of exosomes, which can facilitate point-of-care testing for future healthcare. Nowadays, inspired by the surge of artificial intelligence (AI) for science and technology, more and more AI algorithms are being adopted to process the exosome spectrum and image data from plasmonic detection. Using representative algorithms of machine learning has become a mainstream trend in plasmonic biosensing research for exosome liquid biopsy. Typically, these algorithms process complex exosome datasets efficiently and establish powerful predictive models for precise diagnosis. This review further discusses critical strategies of AI algorithm selection in exosome-based diagnosis. Particularly, we categorize the AI algorithms into the interpretable and uninterpretable groups for exosome plasmonic detection applications. The interpretable AI enhances the transparency and reliability of diagnosis by elucidating the decision- making process, while the uninterpretable AI provides high diagnostic accuracy with robust data processing by a "black-box" working mode. We believe that AI will continue to promote significant progress of exosome plasmonic detection and mobile healthcare in the near future.

AB  - In group decision making, human experts are usually susceptible to cognitive biases and information overload. Artificial intelligence (AI) has capabilities in data processing and analysis, but is limited by issues such as interpretability and human adoption. Humans and AI have different problem-solving capabilities, they can benefit from each other. Thus, there is a need to leverage a mechanism to tap into the intelligence of both parties and achieve mutually shared outcomes. In this study, we propose a large-scale group decision-making model with human-AI consensus. First, an improved density-peak clustering algorithm is utilized to classify experts into subgroups based on the Similarity-Trust-Attitude score. Then, weights of experts and subgroups are obtained based on the internal influence of experts and the intuitionistic fuzzy entropy of subgroup preferences. Further, considering three different strategies of human-AI interaction, subgroup consensus and subgroup-AI consensus are calculated. Finally, a minimum cost consensus model with heterogeneous feedback strategies is proposed. The usability of the proposed model is verified through a medical diagnosis case. This study found that the human-AI coordination with heterogeneous feedback strategies can reduce adjustment costs, and different interaction mechanisms have different effects.

AB  - Patient no-shows significantly disrupt pediatric healthcare delivery, highlighting the necessity for precise predictive models, especially during the dynamic shifts caused by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In outpatient settings, these no-shows result in medical resource underutilization, increased healthcare costs, reduced access to care, and decreased clinic efficiency and increased provider workload. The objective is to develop a predictive model for patient no-shows using data-driven techniques. We analyzed five years of historical data retrieved from both a scheduling system and electronic health records from a general pediatrics clinic within the WVU Health systems. This dataset includes 209,408 visits from 2015 to 2018, 82,925 visits in 2019, and 58,820 visits in 2020, spanning both the pre-pandemic and pandemic periods. The data include variables such as patient demographics, appointment details, timing, hospital characteristics, appointment types, and environmental factors. Our XGBoost model demonstrated robust predictive capabilities, notably outperforming traditional "no-show rate" metrics. Precision and recall metrics for all features were 0.82 and 0.88, respectively. Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) analysis yielded AUCs of 0.90 for all features and 0.88 for the top five predictors when evaluated on the 2019 cohort. Furthermore, model generalization across racial/ethnic groups was also observed. Evaluation on 2020 telehealth data reaffirmed model efficacy (AUC: 0.90), with consistent top predictive features. Our study presents a sophisticated predictive model for pediatric no-show rates, offering insights into nuanced factors influencing attendance behavior. The model's adaptability to evolving healthcare delivery models, including telehealth, underscores its potential for enhancing clinical practice and resource allocation.

AB  - Responsible AI is concerned with the design, implementation and use of ethical, transparent, and accountable AI technology in order to reduce biases, promote fairness, equality, and to help facilitate interpretability and explainability of outcomes, which are particularly pertinent in a healthcare context. However, the extant literature on health AI reveals significant issues regarding each of the areas of responsible AI, posing moral and ethical consequences. This is particularly concerning in a health context where lives are at stake and where there are significant sensitivities that are not as pertinent in other domains outside of health. This calls for a comprehensive analysis of health AI using responsible AI concepts as a structural lens. A systematic literature review supported our data collection and sampling procedure, the corresponding analysis, and extraction of research themes helped us provide an evidence-based foundation. We contribute with a systematic description and explanation of the intellectual structure of Responsible AI in digital health and develop an agenda for future research.

AB  - PurposeSmile design software increasingly relies on artificial intelligence (AI). However, using AI for smile design raises numerous technical and ethical concerns. This study aimed to evaluate these ethical issues.MethodsAn international consortium of experts specialized in AI, dentistry, and smile design was engaged to emulate and assess the ethical challenges raised by the use of AI for smile design. An e-Delphi protocol was used to seek the agreement of the ITU-WHO group on well-established ethical principles regarding the use of AI (wellness, respect for autonomy, privacy protection, solidarity, governance, equity, diversity, expertise/prudence, accountability/responsibility, sustainability, and transparency). Each principle included examples of ethical challenges that users might encounter when using AI for smile design.ResultsOn the first round of the e-Delphi exercise, participants agreed that seven items should be considered in smile design (diversity, transparency, wellness, privacy protection, prudence, law and governance, and sustainable development), but the remaining four items (equity, accountability and responsibility, solidarity, and respect of autonomy) were rejected and had to be reformulated. After a second round, participants agreed to all items that should be considered while using AI for smile design.ConclusionsAI development and deployment for smile design should abide by the ethical principles of wellness, respect for autonomy, privacy protection, solidarity, governance, equity, diversity, expertise/prudence, accountability/responsibility, sustainability, and transparency.

AB  - Treatment response heterogeneity has long been observed in patients affected by chronic diseases. Administering an individualized treatment rule (ITR) offers an opportunity to tailor treatment strategies according to patient-specific characteristics. Overly complex machine learning methods for estimating ITRs may produce treatment rules that have higher benefit but lack transparency and interpretability. In clinical practices, it is desirable to derive a simple and interpretable ITR while maintaining certain optimality that leads to improved benefit in subgroups of patients, if not on the overall sample. In this work, we propose a tree-based robust learning method to estimate optimal piecewise linear ITRs and identify subgroups of patients with a large benefit. We achieve these goals by simultaneously identifying qualitative and quantitative interactions through a tree model, referred to as the composite interaction tree (CITree). We show that it has improved performance compared to existing methods on both overall sample and subgroups via extensive simulation studies. Lastly, we fit CITree to Research Evaluating the Value of Augmenting Medication with Psychotherapy trial for treating patients with major depressive disorders, where we identified both qualitative and quantitative interactions and subgroups of patients with a large benefit.

AB  - Background and ObjectivesDistinguishing neurodegenerative diseases is a challenging task requiring neurologic expertise. Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) powered by machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence can assist with complex diagnostic tasks by augmenting user capabilities, but workflow integration poses many challenges. We propose that a modeling framework based on fluorodeoxyglucose PET (FDG-PET) imaging can address these challenges and form the basis of an effective CDSS for neurodegenerative disease.MethodsThis retrospective study focused on FDG-PET images in a discovery cohort drawn from 3 research studies plus routine clinical patients. When selecting research study participants, the inclusion criterion was the availability of an FDG-PET image from within 2.5 years of diagnosis with 1 of 9 specific neurodegenerative syndromes or designation as unimpaired. Participants from disease groups were recruited from the clinical patient population while unimpaired participants came primarily from a population study. The discovery cohort was used to develop a clinical decision support framework we call StateViewer, which applies a neighbor matching algorithm to detect the presence of 9 different neurodegenerative phenotypes. The ML performance of this framework was evaluated in the discovery cohort by nested cross-validation and externally validated in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Potential for clinical integration was demonstrated in a radiologic reader study focused on differentiating posterior cortical atrophy from Lewy body dementia.ResultsThe discovery cohort contained 3,671 individuals with a mean age of 68 years and consisted of 49% reported female. Our model framework was able to detect the presence of 9 different neurodegenerative phenotypes with a sensitivity of 0.89 +/- 0.03 and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.93 +/- 0.02. In the radiologic reader study, readers using our model were found to have 3.3 +/- 1.1 times greater odds of making a correct diagnosis than readers using a current standard-of-care workflow.DiscussionOur proposed framework provides strong classification performance with high interpretability, and it addresses many of the challenges that face clinical integration of ML-based decision support tools. One limitation of this study is a uniform discovery cohort that is not representative of other patient populations in some regards.

AB  - Artificial intelligence as a medical device is increasingly being applied to healthcare for diagnosis, risk stratification and resource allocation. However, a growing body of evidence has highlighted the risk of algorithmic bias, which may perpetuate existing health inequity. This problem arises in part because of systemic inequalities in dataset curation, unequal opportunity to participate in research and inequalities of access. This study aims to explore existing standards, frameworks and best practices for ensuring adequate data diversity in health datasets. Exploring the body of existing literature and expert views is an important step towards the development of consensus-based guidelines. The study comprises two parts: a systematic review of existing standards, frameworks and best practices for healthcare datasets; and a survey and thematic analysis of stakeholder views of bias, health equity and best practices for artificial intelligence as a medical device. We found that the need for dataset diversity was well described in literature, and experts generally favored the development of a robust set of guidelines, but there were mixed views about how these could be implemented practically. The outputs of this study will be used to inform the development of standards for transparency of data diversity in health datasets (the STANDING Together initiative).
   A systematic review, combined with a stakeholder survey, presents an overview of current practices and recommendations for dataset curation in health, with specific focuses on data diversity and artificial intelligence-based applications.

AB  - Cyber-attacks have perceived explosive growth in today's technologically driven world, significantly impacting critical sectors such as healthcare, finance, and industrial automation systems. With these vulnerabilities increasing daily, addressing them has become a major challenge for researchers. Adding to this complexity, zero-day attacks are penetrating deeply into people's lives and pose a significant threat to mitigation efforts. Modern Intrusion Detection Systems (MIDS), which leverage the strengths of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning (DL), have emerged as promising solutions for detecting various types of attacks. To ensure a highly secure environment, this paper proposes an Explainable Deep Learning Framework (X-DLF) for the classification of diverse cyber-attacks. The proposed system integrates an Attention-Evoked Gated Recurrent (AEGR) and Long Short-Term Memory Network (AEGR-LSTM) to mitigate threats posed by malicious activities. The X-DLF not only detects intrusions but also provides interpretability, offering insights into the rationale behind each classification decision. Extensive experiments were conducted using a variety of benchmark datasets, and performance metrics like specificity, recall, accuracy, F1-score and precision were computed and examined with existing learning models. Furthermore, the flexibility and scalability of the proposed approach were validated using Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), which helped identify the most significant features influencing the model's decisions. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed X-DLF was demonstrated by comparison with existing deep learning approaches, achieving superior results with 97.5% accuracy, 97.3% precision, 97.1% recall, and 97.5% F1-score.

AB  - LLMs can accomplish specialized medical knowledge tasks, however, equitable access is hindered by the extensive fine-tuning, specialized medical data requirement, and limited access to proprietary models. Open-source (OS) medical LLMs show performance improvements and provide the transparency and compliance required in healthcare. We present OpenMedLM, a prompting platform delivering state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for OS LLMs on medical benchmarks. We evaluated OS foundation LLMs (7B-70B) on medical benchmarks (MedQA, MedMCQA, PubMedQA, MMLU medical-subset) and selected Yi34B for developing OpenMedLM. Prompting strategies included zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, and ensemble/self-consistency voting. OpenMedLM delivered OS SOTA results on three medical LLM benchmarks, surpassing previous best-performing OS models that leveraged costly and extensive fine-tuning. OpenMedLM displays the first results to date demonstrating the ability of OS foundation models to optimize performance, absent specialized fine-tuning. The model achieved 72.6% accuracy on MedQA, outperforming the previous SOTA by 2.4%, and 81.7% accuracy on MMLU medical-subset, establishing itself as the first OS LLM to surpass 80% accuracy on this benchmark. Our results highlight medical-specific emergent properties in OS LLMs not documented elsewhere to date and validate the ability of OS models to accomplish healthcare tasks, highlighting the benefits of prompt engineering to improve performance of accessible LLMs for medical applications.

AB  - Accurate medical image classification is crucial for effective clinical decision support, improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. However, developing expert Computer-Aided Diagnosis systems for accurate medical image classification remains a challenging task. Recent advancements in attention mechanisms have revolutionized deep learning-based approaches, leading to improved performance even in applications with limited labeled data. Despite these advances, challenges such as overfitting and poor generalization persist. This work introduces a novel deep learning-based model that incorporates Adaptive Fusion Attention to enhance medical image analysis. The proposed attention module employs a hierarchical fusion of spatial and temporal attention mechanisms, complemented by adaptive refinement. This enables the model to focus on the most discriminative features in medical images, improving its ability to detect abnormalities. Additionally, GRAD-CAM visualizations demonstrate that the model effectively highlights pathological regions while minimizing attention on non-relevant areas. The model is evaluated on three benchmark datasets-APTOS-2019, Figshare, and SARS-CoV-2-demonstrating its effectiveness in Diabetic Retinopathy grading, Brain Tumor Classification, and COVID-19 detection. Experimental results show substantial improvements, achieving 84.56% accuracy for retinopathy grading, 99.60% accuracy for tumor classification, and 99.35% accuracy for COVID-19 detection. These results, along with superior performance across other metrics such as ROC-AUC, and F1-scores, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model with Adaptive Fusion Attention over existing approaches.

AB  - Although the benefits of machine learning are undeniable in healthcare, explainability plays a vital role in improving transparency and understanding the most decisive and persuasive variables for prediction. The challenge is to identify explanations that make sense to the biomedical expert. This work proposes discernibility as a new approach to faithfully reflect human cognition, based on the user's perception of a relationship between explanations and data for a given variable. A total of 50 participants (19 biomedical experts and 31 data scientists) evaluated their perception of the discernibility of explanations from both synthetic and human-based datasets (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey). The low inter-rater reliability of discernibility (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient < 0.5), with no significant difference between areas of expertise or levels of education, highlights the need for an objective metric of discernibility. Thirteen statistical coefficients were evaluated for their ability to capture, for a given variable, the relationship between its values and its explanations using Passing-Bablok regression. Among these, dcor was shown to be a reliable metric for assessing the discernibility of explanations, effectively capturing the clarity of the relationship between the data and their explanations, and providing clues to underlying pathophysiological mechanisms not immediately apparent when examining individual predictors. Discernibility can also serve as an evaluation metric for model quality, helping to prevent overfitting and aiding in feature selection, ultimately providing medical practitioners with more accurate and persuasive results.

AB  - Background and objectives: The multiple chest x-ray datasets released in the last years have ground-truth labels intended for different computer vision tasks, suggesting that performance in automated chest x-ray interpretation might improve by using a method that can exploit diverse types of annotations. This work presents a Deep Learning method based on the late fusion of different convolutional architectures, that allows training with heterogeneous data with a simple implementation, and evaluates its performance on independent test data. We focused on obtaining a clinically useful tool that could be successfully integrated into a hospital workflow.
   Materials and methods: Based on expert opinion, we selected four target chest x-ray findings, namely lung opacities, fractures, pneumothorax and pleural effusion. For each finding we defined the most suitable type of ground-truth label, and built four training datasets combining images from public chest x-ray datasets and our institutional archive. We trained four different Deep Learning architectures and combined their outputs with a late fusion strategy, obtaining a unified tool. The performance was measured on two test datasets: an external openly-available dataset, and a retrospective institutional dataset, to estimate performance on the local population.
   Results: The external and local test sets had 4376 and 1064 images, respectively, for which the model showed an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve of 0.75 (95%CI: 0.74-0.76) and 0.87 (95%CI: 0.86-0.89) in the detection of abnormal chest x-rays. For the local population, a sensitivity of 86% (95%CI: 84-90), and a specificity of 88% (95%CI: 86-90) were obtained, with no significant differences between demographic subgroups. We present examples of heatmaps to show the accomplished level of interpretability, examining true and false positives.
   Conclusion: This study presents a new approach for exploiting heterogeneous labels from different chest x-ray datasets, by choosing Deep Learning architectures according to the radiological characteristics of each pathological finding. We estimated the tool's performance on the local population, obtaining results comparable to state-of-the-art metrics. We believe this approach is closer to the actual reading process of chest x-rays by professionals, and therefore more likely to be successful in a real clinical setting. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Scoring systems, as a type of predictive model, have significant advantages in interpretability and transparency and facilitate quick decision-making. As such, scoring systems have been extensively used in a wide variety of industries, such as healthcare and criminal justice. However, the fairness issues in these models have long been criticized, and the use of big data and machine learning (ML) algorithms in the construction of scoring systems heightens this concern. This article proposes a general framework to create fairness-aware, data-driven scoring systems. First, we develop a social welfare function that incorporates both efficiency and group fairness. Then, we transform the social welfare maximization problem into the risk minimization task in ML, and derive a fairness-aware scoring system with the help of mixed-integer programming. Lastly, several theoretical bounds are derived for providing parameter selection suggestions. Our proposed framework provides a suitable solution to address group fairness concerns in developing scoring systems. It enables policymakers to set and customize their desired fairness requirements as well as other application-specific constraints. We test the proposed algorithm with several empirical data sets. Experimental evidence supports the effectiveness of the proposed scoring system in achieving the optimal welfare of stakeholders and in balancing the needs for interpretability, fairness, and efficiency.

AB  - Background Predictive modeling with longitudinal electronic health record (EHR) data offers great promise for accelerating personalized medicine and better informs clinical decision-making. Recently, deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance for many healthcare prediction tasks. However, deep models lack interpretability, which is integral to successful decision-making and can lead to better patient care. In this paper, we build upon the contextual decomposition (CD) method, an algorithm for producing importance scores from long short-term memory networks (LSTMs). We extend the method to bidirectional LSTMs (BiLSTMs) and use it in the context of predicting future clinical outcomes using patients' EHR historical visits. Methods We use a real EHR dataset comprising 11071 patients, to evaluate and compare CD interpretations from LSTM and BiLSTM models. First, we train LSTM and BiLSTM models for the task of predicting which pre-school children with respiratory system-related complications will have asthma at school-age. After that, we conduct quantitative and qualitative analysis to evaluate the CD interpretations produced by the contextual decomposition of the trained models. In addition, we develop an interactive visualization to demonstrate the utility of CD scores in explaining predicted outcomes. Results Our experimental evaluation demonstrate that whenever a clear visit-level pattern exists, the models learn that pattern and the contextual decomposition can appropriately attribute the prediction to the correct pattern. In addition, the results confirm that the CD scores agree to a large extent with the importance scores generated using logistic regression coefficients. Our main insight was that rather than interpreting the attribution of individual visits to the predicted outcome, we could instead attribute a model's prediction to a group of visits. Conclusion We presented a quantitative and qualitative evidence that CD interpretations can explain patient-specific predictions using CD attributions of individual visits or a group of visits.

AB  - The increasing global prevalence of monkeypox (mpox) has necessitated the development of accurate, efficient, and interpretable diagnostic models for timely disease identification. Although deep learning has advanced medical image analysis, diagnosing diseases with complex lesions, such as monkeypox, remains challenging in resource-limited settings. Existing methods often rely on large architectures that demand high computational resources and lack interpretability. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight, interpretable architecture that truncates MobileNetV2 for efficient feature extraction, incorporates Ghost Modules to reduce redundancy, and integrates a SA-MobileViT block to capture both local and global dependencies in lesion images. Grad-CAM visualizations enhance interpretability, and Optuna is used for hyperparameter optimization. Our model achieved an accuracy of 98.72%, precision of 98.76%, recall of 98.72%, and F1-score of 98.72%, outperforming existing approaches, especially in handling irregular lesion patterns. The model's design is ideal for deployment in resource-constrained settings, offering a robust solution for real-world healthcare applications. Grad-CAM, saliency maps, and other visualization techniques help improve clinical trust by highlighting relevant regions in input images, emphasizing key features of the lesions. The proposed model is lightweight with only 630,204 parameters, making it 92.3x smaller than ResNet152V2 (58,152,004 parameters) and 28.7x smaller than DenseNet201 (18,100,612 parameters). It requires 321.61M FLOPs, 35.8x fewer than ResNet152V2 (11.51G FLOPs) and 13.4x fewer than DenseNet201 (4.29G FLOPs). With a size of just 72.92 MB, it is 8.14x smaller than ResNet152V2 (594.08 MB) and 4.57x smaller than DenseNet201 (333.47 MB), making it an efficient solution for mobile and edge deployment in resource-constrained environments.

AB  - The use of machine learning in medical decision support systems can improve diagnostic accuracy and objectivity for clinical experts. In this study, we conducted a comparison of 16 different fuzzy rule-based algorithms applied to 12 medical datasets and real-world data. The results of this comparison showed that the best performing algorithms in terms of average results of Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), area under the curve (AUC), and accuracy (ACC) was a classifier based on fuzzy logic and gene expression programming (GPR), repeated incremental pruning to produce error reduction (Ripper), and ordered incremental genetic algorithm (OIGA), respectively. We also analyzed the number and size of the rules generated by each algorithm and provided examples to objectively evaluate the utility of each algorithm in clinical decision support. The shortest and most interpretable rules were generated by 1R, GPR, and C45Rules-C. Our research suggests that GPR is capable of generating concise and interpretable rules while maintaining good classification performance, and it may be a valuable algorithm for generating rules from medical data.

AB  - An abundance of medical data and enhanced computational power have led to a surge in artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Published studies involving AI in bone and osteoporosis research have increased exponentially, raising the need for transparent model development and reporting strategies. This review offers a comprehensive overview and systematic quality assessment of AI articles in osteoporosis while highlighting recent advancements. A systematic search in the PubMed database, from December 17, 2020 to February 1, 2023 was conducted to identify AI articles that relate to osteoporosis. The quality assessment of the studies relied on the systematic evaluation of 12 quality items derived from the minimum information about clinical artificial intelligence modeling checklist. The systematic search yielded 97 articles that fell into 5 areas; bone properties assessment (11 articles), osteoporosis classification (26 articles), fracture detection/classification (25 articles), risk prediction (24 articles), and bone segmentation (11 articles). The average quality score for each study area was 8.9 (range: 7-11) for bone properties assessment, 7.8 (range: 5-11) for osteoporosis classification, 8.4 (range: 7-11) for fracture detection, 7.6 (range: 4-11) for risk prediction, and 9.0 (range: 6-11) for bone segmentation. A sixth area, AI-driven clinical decision support, identified the studies from the 5 preceding areas that aimed to improve clinician efficiency, diagnostic accuracy, and patient outcomes through AI-driven models and opportunistic screening by automating or assisting with specific clinical tasks in complex scenarios. The current work highlights disparities in study quality and a lack of standardized reporting practices. Despite these limitations, a wide range of models and examination strategies have shown promising outcomes to aid in the earlier diagnosis and improve clinical decision-making. Through careful consideration of sources of bias in model performance assessment, the field can build confidence in AI-based approaches, ultimately leading to improved clinical workflows and patient outcomes.
   This review covers the recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) for managing osteoporosis, an increasingly prevalent condition that weakens bone tissues and increases fracture risk. Analyzing 97 studies from December 2020 to February 2023, the present work highlights how AI enhances bone properties assessment, osteoporosis classification, fracture detection and classification, risk prediction, and bone segmentation.A systematic qualitative assessment of the studies revealed improvements in study quality compared with the earlier review period, supported by innovative and more explainable AI approaches. AI shows promise in clinical decision support by offering novel screening tools that can help in the earlier identification of the disease, improve clinical workflows, and patient prognosis. New pre-processing strategies and advanced model architectures have played a critical role in these improvements.Researchers have enhanced the accuracy and predictive performance of traditional methods by integrating clinical data with imaging data through advanced multi-factorial AI techniques. These innovations, paired with standardized development and validation processes, promise to personalize medicine and enhance patient care in osteoporosis management.

AB  - Precision medicine based on personalized genomics provides promising strategies to enhance the efficacy of molecular-targeted therapies. However, the clinical effectiveness of drugs has been severely limited due to genetic variations that lead to drug resistance. Predicting the impact of missense mutations on clinical drug response is an essential way to reduce the cost of clinical trials and understand genetic diseases. Here, we present Emden, a novel method integrating graph and transformer representations that predicts the effect of missense mutations on drug response through binary classification with interpretability. Emden utilized protein sequences-based features and drug structures as inputs for rapid prediction, employing competitive representation learning and demonstrating strong generalization capabilities and robustness. Our study showed promising potential for clinical drug guidance and deep insight into computer-assisted precision medicine. Emden is freely available as a web server at https://www.psymukb.net/Emden.

AB  - Cox Proportional Hazards (CPH) analysis is the standard for survival analysis in oncology. Recently, several machine learning (ML) techniques have been adapted for this task. Although they have shown to yield results at least as good as classical methods, they are often disregarded because of their lack of transparency and little to no explainability, which are key for their adoption in clinical settings. In this paper, we used data from the Netherlands Cancer Registry of 36,658 non-metastatic breast cancer patients to compare the performance of CPH with ML techniques (Random Survival Forests, Survival Support Vector Machines, and Extreme Gradient Boosting [XGB]) in predicting survival using the c -index. We demonstrated that in our dataset, ML-based models can perform at least as good as the classical CPH regression ( c-index similar to 0.63), and in the case of XGB even better ( c-index similar to 0.73). Furthermore, we used Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) values to explain the models' predictions. We concluded that the difference in performance can be attributed to XGB's ability to model nonlinearities and complex interactions. We also investigated the impact of specific features on the models' predictions as well as their corresponding insights. Lastly, we showed that explainable ML can generate explicit knowledge of how models make their predictions, which is crucial in increasing the trust and adoption of innovative ML techniques in oncology and healthcare overall.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Early detection and effective risk assessment are crucial for implementing preventive measures and improving patient outcomes for CVDs. This work presents a novel approach to CVD risk assessment using fundus images, leveraging the inherent connection between retinal microvascular changes and systemic vascular health. This study aims to develop a predictive model for the early detection of CVDs by evaluating retinal vascular parameters. This methodology integrates both handcrafted features derived through mathematical computation and retinal vascular patterns extracted by artificial intelligence (AI) models. By combining these approaches, we seek to enhance the accuracy and reliability of CVD risk prediction in individuals. The methodology integrates state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms and AI techniques in a multi-stage architecture to extract relevant features from retinal fundus images. These features encompass a range of vascular parameters, including vessel caliber, tortuosity, and branching patterns. Additionally, a deep learning (DL)-based binary classification model is incorporated to enhance predictive accuracy. A dataset comprising fundus images and comprehensive metadata from the clinical trials conducted is utilized for training and validation. The proposed approach demonstrates promising results in the early prediction of CVD risk factors. The interpretability of the approach is enhanced through visualization techniques that highlight the regions of interest within the fundus images that are contributing to the risk predictions. Furthermore, the validation conducted in the clinical trials and the performance analysis of the proposed approach shows the potential to provide early and accurate predictions. The proposed system not only aids in risk stratification but also serves as a valuable tool for identifying vascular abnormalities that may precede overt cardiovascular events. The approach has achieved an accuracy of 85% and the findings of this study underscore the feasibility and efficacy of leveraging fundus images for cardiovascular risk assessment. As a non-invasive and cost-effective modality, fundus image analysis presents a scalable solution for population-wide screening programs. This research contributes to the evolving landscape of precision medicine by providing an innovative tool for proactive cardiovascular health management. Future work will focus on refining the solution's robustness, exploring additional risk factors, and validating its performance in additional and diverse clinical settings.

AB  - Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a serious condition affecting diabetes people caused by hemorrhage in the light-sensitive retinal area. DR sufferers should receive urgent therapy to avoid vision loss. The intelligent medical diagnosis system for DR is evolving as a result of the inclusion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology. The current AI-driven DR diagnosis techniques are hampered by numerous serious challenges, which undermine their performance. Model performance is generally degraded by low contrast, inhomogeneous lighting, and noise, rendering accurate results hard to achieve. As a result, the proposed study has created an Adaptive Gabor Filter (AGF) based on the Chaotic Map to improve filtering performance. The multi-folded features like Local Binary Patterns (LBP), Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF), and Texture Energy Measurement (TEM) are extracted and fed into classification phase. The classification phase has the Attention layer, the dense block of DenseNet, and Optimized Gated Recurrent Unit (OGRU) based on a Self-Adaptive Northern Goshawk Optimization (SANGO) algorithm for enhancing classification performance. The system was evaluated using three datasets: DiaRetDB1, APTOS 2019, and EyePacs, which demonstrated its robustness and reliability. Furthermore, the Grad Cam in the suggested technique assures the effective implementation of segmentation and classification performance. Performance is demonstrated by the use of Intersection over Union (IoU), Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Measure, Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), and other metrics. In addition, the five-fold categorization is used to analyse the outcome performance. The suggested model achieved an accuracy of 99.01% on the DiaRetDB1 dataset, 98.98% on the APTOS 2019 dataset, and 99.12% on the EyePacs dataset.

AB  - Background and Objective: Tinnitus is a neuropathological condition that results in mild buzzing or ringing of the ears without an external sound source. Current tinnitus diagnostic methods often rely on subjective assessment and require intricate medical examinations. This study aimed to propose an interpretable tinnitus diagnostic framework using auditory late response (ALR) and electroencephalogram (EEG), inspired by the gap-prepulse inhibition (GPI) paradigm. Methods: We collected spontaneous EEG and ALR data from 44 patients with tinnitus and 47 hearing lossmatched controls using specialized hardware to capture responses to sound stimuli with embedded gaps. In this cohort study of tinnitus and control groups, we examined EEG spectral and ALR features of N-P complexes, comparing the responses to gap durations of 50 and 20 ms alongside no-gap conditions. To this end, we developed an interpretable tinnitus diagnostic model using ALR and EEG metrics, boosting machine learning architecture, and explainable feature attribution approaches. Results: Our proposed model achieved 90 % accuracy in identifying tinnitus, with an area under the performance curve of 0.89. The explainable artificial intelligence approaches have revealed gap-embedded ALR features such as the GPI ratio of N1-P2 and EEG spectral ratio, which can serve as diagnostic metrics for tinnitus. Our method successfully provides personalized prediction explanations for tinnitus diagnosis using gap-embedded auditory and neurological features. Conclusions: Deficits in GPI alongside activity in the EEG alpha-beta ratio offer a promising screening tool for assessing tinnitus risk, aligning with current clinical insights from hearing research.

AB  - Fragmentation of healthcare systems through limited cross-speciality communication and intermittent, intervention-based care, without insight into follow-up and compliance, results in poor patient experiences and potentially contributes to suboptimal outcomes. Data-driven tools and novel technologies have the capability to address these shortcomings, but insights from all stakeholders in the care continuum remain lacking. A structured online questionnaire was given to respondents (n = 1432) in nine global geographies to investigate attitudes to the use of data and novel technologies in the management of vascular disease. Patients with coronary or peripheral artery disease (n = 961), physicians responsible for their care (n = 345), and administrators/healthcare leaders with responsibility for commissioning/procuring cardiovascular services (n = 126) were included. Narrative themes arising from the survey included patients' desire for more personalized healthcare, shared decision-making, and improved communication. Patients, administrators, and physicians perceived and experienced deficiencies in continuity of care, and all acknowledged the potential for data-driven techniques and novel technologies to address some of these shortcomings. Further, physicians and administrators saw the 'upstream' segment of the care journey-before diagnosis, at point of diagnosis, and when determining treatment-as key to enabling tangible improvements in patient experience and outcomes. Finally, despite acceptance that data sharing is critical to the success of such interventions, there remains persistent issues related to trust and transparency. The current fragmented care continuum could be improved and streamlined through the adoption of advanced data analytics and novel technologies, including diagnostic and monitoring techniques. Such an approach could enable the refocusing of healthcare from intermittent contacts and intervention-only focus to a more holistic patient view.

AB  - Background: Informed consent is fundamental to ethical medical practice, ensuring that patients understand the procedures they undergo, the associated risks, and available alternatives. The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare, particularly in diagnostics, introduces complexities that traditional informed consent forms do not adequately address. AI technologies, such as image analysis and decision-support systems, offer significant benefits but also raise ethical, legal, and practical concerns regarding patient information and autonomy. Main body: The integration of AI in healthcare diagnostics necessitates a re-evaluation of current informed consent practices to ensure that patients are fully aware of AI's role, capabilities, and limitations in their care. Existing standards, such as those in the UK's National Health Service and the US, highlight the need for transparency and patient understanding but often fall short when applied to AI. The "black box" phenomenon, where the inner workings of AI systems are not transparent, poses a significant challenge. This lack of transparency can lead to over-reliance or distrust in AI tools by clinicians and patients alike. Additionally, the current informed consent process often fails to provide detailed explanations about AI algorithms, the data they use, and inherent biases. There is also a notable gap in the training and education of healthcare professionals on AI technologies, which impacts their ability to communicate effectively with patients. Ethical and legal considerations, including data privacy and algorithmic fairness, are frequently inadequately addressed in consent forms. Furthermore, integrating AI into clinical workflows presents practical challenges that require careful planning and robust support systems. Conclusion: This review proposes strategies for redesigning informed consent forms. These include using plain language, visual aids, and personalised information to improve patient understanding and trust. Implementing continuous monitoring and feedback mechanisms can ensure the ongoing effectiveness of these forms. Future research should focus on developing comprehensive regulatory frameworks and enhancing communication techniques to convey complex AI concepts to patients. By improving informed consent practices, we can uphold ethical standards, foster patient trust, and support the responsible integration of AI in healthcare, ultimately benefiting both patients and healthcare providers.

AB  - In dental school clinics, students are increasingly using Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools like ChatGPT during patient care. This chairside, or point of care, use raises ethical concerns, particularly around supervision, patient safety, and training quality. This paper argues that GenAI can be ethically used in dental education if implemented with transparency, structured oversight, and robust ethics training. Using a utilitarian framework, the paper explores how GenAI can maximize benefits, such as consistency and efficiency, while minimizing harm when used appropriately. It emphasizes that faculty must guide students in GenAI use, and that patients should have the opportunity to provide informed consent when GenAI influences care. Responsibly incorporating GenAI in dental school clinics should prepare students to become competent, ethical clinicians in a technology-integrated healthcare system.

AB  - Identifying the relationship between imaging features and genetic variation (a term coined"imaging genomics") offers valuable insight into the pathogenesis of cancer, as well as cognitive and psychiatric disorders. However, how to integrate-omics and imaging data in a biologically meaningful approach to both provide pathobiological underpinning and achieve clinical applications remain challenging. In this review, we aim to discuss the difficulties in combining different sources of data and explaining the genotype-phenotype association, and we attempt to discuss the potential applications of imaging genomics in several (patho)physiological questions to better understand human physiology and disease. Future efforts on deciphering the genotype-phenotype landscapes by interpretable imaging genomics analyses are needed to provide new insights into molecular biology and molecular medicine.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly driven advancement in the healthcare field by enabling the integration of highly advanced algorithms to improve diagnostics, patient surveillance, and treatment planning. Nonetheless, dependence on sensitive health data and automated decision-making exposes such systems to escalating risks of privacy breaches and is under rigorous regulatory oversight. In particular, the EU AI Act classifies AI uses pertaining to healthcare as "high-risk", thus requiring the application of strict provisions related to transparency, safety, and privacy. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the diverse privacy attacks that can target machine learning (ML)-based healthcare systems, including data-centric and model-centric attacks. We then propose a novel privacy-preserving architecture that integrates federated learning with secure computation protocols to minimally expose data while ensuring strong model performance. We outline an ongoing monitoring mechanism compliant with EU AI Act specifications and GDPR standards to further improve trust and compliance. We further elaborate on an independent adaptive algorithm that automatically tunes the level of cryptographic protection based on contextual factors like risk severity, computational capacity, and regulatory environment. This research aims to serve as a blueprint for designing trustworthy, high-risk AI systems in healthcare under emerging regulations by providing an in-depth review of ML-specific privacy threats and proposing a holistic technical solution.

However, Decision Tree and Random Forest methods proved to be the best, both due to their maximum achieved values of accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity, and due to result interpretability.ConclusionIt has been established that machine learning methods are capable of identifying potential issues before they become critical, thus playing a crucial role in predicting the performance of infusion pumps, potentially enhancing the safety, reliability, and efficiency of healthcare delivery. Further research is needed to explore the potential application of machine learning algorithms in various healthcare domains and to address practical issues related to the implementation of these algorithms in real clinical settings.

TI  - Federated unsupervised random forest for privacy-preserving patient stratification
T2  - BIOINFORMATICS
LA  - English
AB  - Motivation In the realm of precision medicine, effective patient stratification and disease subtyping demand innovative methodologies tailored for multi-omics data. Clustering techniques applied to multi-omics data have become instrumental in identifying distinct subgroups of patients, enabling a finer-grained understanding of disease variability. Meanwhile, clinical datasets are often small and must be aggregated from multiple hospitals. Online data sharing, however, is seen as a significant challenge due to privacy concerns, potentially impeding big data's role in medical advancements using machine learning. This work establishes a powerful framework for advancing precision medicine through unsupervised random forest-based clustering in combination with federated computing.Results We introduce a novel multi-omics clustering approach utilizing unsupervised random forests. The unsupervised nature of the random forest enables the determination of cluster-specific feature importance, unraveling key molecular contributors to distinct patient groups. Our methodology is designed for federated execution, a crucial aspect in the medical domain where privacy concerns are paramount. We have validated our approach on machine learning benchmark datasets as well as on cancer data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Our method is competitive with the state-of-the-art in terms of disease subtyping, but at the same time substantially improves the cluster interpretability. Experiments indicate that local clustering performance can be improved through federated computing.Availability and implementation The proposed methods are available as an R-package (https://github.com/pievos101/uRF)

AB  - Introduction Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are increasingly being developed and deployed to support clinical decision-making, care delivery and patient monitoring in healthcare. However, the adoption of AI-driven solutions by nurses, who comprise the largest segment of the healthcare workforce and are central to patient care, has been limited to date. Understanding nurses' perceptions of barriers and facilitators to AI adoption is critical for successful integration of AI in nursing practice. This systematic review aims to identify, appraise and synthesise qualitative evidence on nurses' perceived barriers and facilitators to adopting AI-driven solutions in their clinical practice.Methods and analysis We will conduct systematic searches across eight electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, CINAHL, MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, PsycINFO and Scopus) from inception to January 2025, supplemented by hand-searching reference lists and grey literature. Primary qualitative studies and qualitative components of mixed-methods studies exploring licensed/registered nurses' perceptions of AI adoption in clinical settings will be included. Two independent reviewers will screen studies, extract data using standardised forms and assess methodological quality using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist. We will employ meta-ethnography to synthesise the qualitative evidence, involving systematic comparison and translation of concepts across studies to develop overarching themes and a theoretical framework. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research (GRADE-CERQual) approach will be used to assess confidence in review findings. The protocol follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines and the Enhancing Transparency in Reporting the Synthesis of Qualitative Research (ENTREQ) statement.Ethics and dissemination No ethical approval is required as this systematic review will synthesise data from published studies only. The findings will provide valuable insights to inform the development, implementation and evaluation of nurse-oriented strategies for AI integration in healthcare delivery. Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publication, conference presentations and stakeholder engagement activities.PROSPERO registration number CRD42024602808.

AB  - Background: Hand fracture management requires precise diagnostic accuracy and complex decision-making. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) suggest that large language models (LLMs) may assist or even rival traditional clinical approaches. This study evaluates the effectiveness of ChatGPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, and Gemini 1.5 in diagnosing and recommending treatment strategies for hand fractures compared to experienced surgeons. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 58 anonymized hand fracture cases was conducted. Clinical details, including fracture site, displacement, and soft-tissue involvement, were provided to the AI models, which generated management plans. Their recommendations were compared to actual surgeon decisions, assessing accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Results: ChatGPT-4o demonstrated the highest accuracy (98.28%) and recall (91.74%), effectively identifying most correct interventions but occasionally proposing extraneous options (precision 58.48%). DeepSeek-V3 showed moderate accuracy (63.79%), with balanced precision (61.17%) and recall (57.89%), sometimes omitting correct treatments. Gemini 1.5 performed poorly (accuracy 18.97%), with low precision and recall, indicating substantial limitations in clinical decision support. Conclusions: AI models can enhance clinical workflows, particularly in radiographic interpretation and triage, but their limitations highlight the irreplaceable role of human expertise in complex hand trauma management. ChatGPT-4o demonstrated promising accuracy but requires refinement. Ethical concerns regarding AI-driven medical decisions, including bias and transparency, must be addressed before widespread clinical implementation.

AB  - Introduction: The emergence and application of generative artificial intelligence/large language models (hereafter GenAI LLMs) have the potential for significant impact on the healthcare industry. However, there is currently a lack of systematic research on GenAI LLMs in healthcare based on reliable data. This article aims to conduct an exploratory study of the application of GenAI LLMs (i.e., ChatGPT) in healthcare from the perspective of digital media (i.e., online news), including the application scenarios, potential opportunities, and challenges. Methods: This research used thematic qualitative text analysis in five steps: firstly, developing main topical categories based on relevant articles; secondly, encoding the search keywords using these categories; thirdly, conducting searches for news articles via Google ; fourthly, encoding the subcategories using the elaborate category system; and finally, conducting category-based analysis and presenting the results. Natural language processing techniques, including the TermRaider and AntConc tool, were applied in the aforementioned steps to assist in text qualitative analysis. Additionally, this study built a framework, using for analyzing the above three topics, from the perspective of five different stakeholders, including healthcare demanders and providers. Results: This study summarizes 26 applications (e.g., provide medical advice, provide diagnosis and triage recommendations, provide mental health support, etc.), 21 opportunities (e.g., make healthcare more accessible, reduce healthcare costs, improve patients care, etc.), and 17 challenges (e.g., generate inaccurate/misleading/wrong answers, raise privacy concerns, lack of transparency, etc.), and analyzes the reasons for the formation of these key items and the links between the three research topics. Conclusions: The application of GenAI LLMs in healthcare is primarily focused on transforming the way healthcare demanders access medical services (i.e., making it more intelligent, refined, and humane) and optimizing the processes through which healthcare providers offer medical services (i.e., simplifying, ensuring timeliness, and reducing errors). As the application becomes more widespread and deepens, GenAI LLMs is expected to have a revolutionary impact on traditional healthcare service models, but it also inevitably raises ethical and security concerns. Furthermore, GenAI LLMs applied in healthcare is still in the initial stage, which can be accelerated from a specific healthcare field (e.g., mental health) or a specific mechanism (e.g., GenAI LLMs' economic benefits allocation mechanism applied to healthcare) with empirical or clinical research.

AB  - Developing machine learning (ML) methods for healthcare predictive modeling requires absolute explainability and transparency to build trust and accountability. Graphical models (GM) are key tools for this but face challenges like small sample sizes, mixed variables, and latent confounders. This paper presents a novel learning framework addressing these challenges by integrating latent variables using fast causal inference (FCI), accommodating mixed variables with predictive permutation conditional independence tests (PPCIT), and employing a systematic graphical embedding approach leveraging expert knowledge. This method ensures a transparent model structure and an explainable feature selection and modeling approach, achieving competitive prediction performance. For real-world validation, data of hospital-acquired pressure injuries (HAPI) among individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) were used, where the approach achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.941 and an AUC of 0.983, outperforming most benchmarks. The PPCIT method also demonstrated superior accuracy and scalability over other benchmarks in causal discovery validation on synthetic datasets that closely resemble our real dataset. This holistic framework effectively addresses the challenges of mixed variables and explainable predictive modeling for disease onset, which is crucial for enabling transparency and interpretability in ML-based healthcare.

AB  - Asthma puts a tremendous overhead on healthcare. To enable effective preventive care to improve outcomes in managing asthma, we recently created two machine learning models, one using University of Washington Medicine data and the other using Intermountain Healthcare data, to predict asthma hospital visits in the next 12 months in asthma patients. As is common in machine learning, neither model supplies explanations for its predictions. To tackle this interpretability issue of black-box models, we developed an automated method to produce rule-style explanations for any machine learning model's predictions made on imbalanced tabular data and to recommend customized interventions without lowering the prediction accuracy. Our method exhibited good performance in explaining our Intermountain Healthcare model's predictions. Yet, it stays unknown how well our method generalizes to academic healthcare systems, whose patient composition differs from that of Intermountain Healthcare. This study evaluates our automated explaining method's generalizability to the academic healthcare system University of Washington Medicine on predicting asthma hospital visits. We did a secondary analysis on 82,888 University of Washington Medicine data instances of asthmatic adults between 2011 and 2018, using our method to explain our University of Washington Medicine model's predictions and to recommend customized interventions. Our results showed that for predicting asthma hospital visits, our automated explaining method had satisfactory generalizability to University of Washington Medicine. In particular, our method explained the predictions for 87.6% of the asthma patients whom our University of Washington Medicine model accurately predicted to experience asthma hospital visits in the next 12 months.

AB  - Healthcare organizations have realized that Artificial intelligence (AI) can provide a competitive edge through personalized patient experiences, improved patient outcomes, early diagnosis, augmented clinician capabilities, enhanced operational efficiencies, or improved medical service accessibility. However, deploying AI-driven tools in the healthcare ecosystem could be challenging. This paper categorizes AI applications in healthcare and comprehensively examines the challenges associated with deploying AI in medical practices at scale. As AI continues to make strides in healthcare, its integration presents various challenges, including production timelines, trust generation, privacy concerns, algorithmic biases, and data scarcity. The paper highlights that flawed business models and wrong workflows in healthcare practices cannot be rectified merely by deploying AI-driven tools. Healthcare organizations should re-evaluate root problems such as misaligned financial incentives (e.g., fee-for-service models), dysfunctional medical workflows (e.g., high rates of patient readmissions), poor care coordination between different providers, fragmented electronic health records systems, and inadequate patient education and engagement models in tandem with AI adoption. This study also explores the need for a cultural shift in viewing AI not as a threat but as an enabler that can enhance healthcare delivery and create new employment opportunities while emphasizing the importance of addressing underlying operational issues. The necessity of investments beyond finance is discussed, emphasizing the importance of human capital, continuous learning, and a supportive environment for AI integration. The paper also highlights the crucial role of clear regulations in building trust, ensuring safety, and guiding the ethical use of AI, calling for coherent frameworks addressing transparency, model accuracy, data quality control, liability, and ethics. Furthermore, this paper underscores the importance of advancing AI literacy within academia to prepare future healthcare professionals for an AI-driven landscape. Through careful navigation and proactive measures addressing these challenges, the healthcare community can harness AI's transformative power responsibly and effectively, revolutionizing healthcare delivery and patient care. The paper concludes with a vision and strategic suggestions for the future of healthcare with AI, emphasizing thoughtful, responsible, and innovative engagement as the pathway to realizing its full potential to unlock immense benefits for healthcare organizations, physicians, nurses, and patients while proactively mitigating risks.

AB  - Understanding the relationship between the genome of a cell and its phenotype is a central problem in precision medicine. Nonetheless, genotype-to-phenotype prediction comes with great challenges for machine learning algorithms that limit their use in this setting. The high dimensionality of the data tends to hinder generalization and challenges the scalability of most learning algorithms. Additionally, most algorithms produce models that are complex and difficult to interpret. We alleviate these limitations by proposing strong performance guarantees, based on sample compression theory, for rule-based learning algorithms that produce highly interpretable models. We show that these guarantees can be leveraged to accelerate learning and improve model interpretability. Our approach is validated through an application to the genomic prediction of antimicrobial resistance, an important public health concern. Highly accurate models were obtained for 12 species and 56 antibiotics, and their interpretation revealed known resistance mechanisms, as well as some potentially new ones. An open-source disk-based implementation that is both memory and computationally efficient is provided with this work. The implementation is turnkey, requires no prior knowledge of machine learning, and is complemented by comprehensive tutorials.

AB  - PurposeThis study aimed to develop and assess the performance of an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven decision support system, XRAInet, in accurately identifying pediatric patients with pleural effusion or pneumothorax and determining whether tube thoracostomy intervention is warranted.MethodsIn this diagnostic accuracy study, we retrospectively analyzed a data set containing 510 X-ray images from 170 pediatric patients admitted between 2005 and 2022. Patients were categorized into two groups: Tube (requiring tube thoracostomy) and Conservative (managed conservatively). XRAInet, a deep learning-based algorithm, was trained using this data set. We evaluated its performance using various metrics, including mean Average Precision (mAP), recall, precision, and F1 score.ResultsXRAInet, achieved a mAP score of 0.918. This result underscores its ability to accurately identify and localize regions necessitating tube thoracostomy for pediatric patients with pneumothorax and pleural effusion. In an independent testing data set, the model exhibited a sensitivity of 64.00% and specificity of 96.15%.ConclusionIn conclusion, XRAInet presents a promising solution for improving the detection and decision-making process for cases of pneumothorax and pleural effusion in pediatric patients using X-ray images. These findings contribute to the expanding field of AI-driven medical imaging, with potential applications for enhancing patient outcomes. Future research endeavors should explore hybrid models, enhance interpretability, address data quality issues, and align with regulatory requirements to ensure the safe and effective deployment of XRAInet in healthcare settings.

AB  - The Metaverse is an online universe that combines virtual reality and augmented reality, linked together via a network.It has generated novel experiences that are fully engaging and transpire in real time, facilitating interpersonal communication and dialogue. Virtual environments with 3D space and avatars can boost patient-facing platforms, operational utilisation, digital education, diagnostics, and treatment choices in medicine and ophthalmology. Globally, there is an increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, with an estimated 25 percent of individuals presently contending with multiple chronic health issues. The management of chronic diseases is currently being rethought in light of the development of technology known together as "Smart Healthcare." A prime example is state-of-the-art wearable technology that incentivizes people to embrace healthier lifestyles through the monitoring of physiological indicators and metabolic processes. With better data organisation and analysis, chronic disease patients may benefit from improved health, privacy, and quality of life. Through the examination of physiological data acquired from wearable devices on a patient, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the capability to generate informed recommendations pertaining to the diagnosis and treatment of illness. These recommendations can be provided by AI. The adoption of blockchain technology (BC) has the potential to significantly advance healthcare in a variety of ways, including decentralised data sharing, user privacy, user empowerment, and dependability in data administration. The potential impact of Wearable Technologies (WT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Blockchain Technology (BC) on Chronic Disease Management (CDM) could be a transition in emphasis from the hospital to the patient. This article provides a patient-centered technical framework for controlling chronic diseases using artificial intelligence, blockchain, and wearable technologies. Our proposed architecture depends on Metaverse environment. In order to participate in the Metaverse, both patients and physicians need to sign up on the Blockchain network. After entering, customers will be accompanied by avatars throughout the experience. A comprehensive record of all information gathered during doctor-patient consultations, including text, videos, images, audio, and clinical data, will be compiled, uploaded to the blockchain, and stored in perpetuity. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) algorithms examine these particulars in order to diagnose and forecast the progression of diseases. We conclude with a discussion of the constraints of this novel paradigm and recommendations for future research.

KW  - ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE
AB  - The computational pathology has been demonstrated to effectively uncover tumor-related genomic alterations and transcriptomic patterns. Although proteomics has indeed shown great potential in the field of precision medicine, few studies have focused on the computational prediction of protein levels from pathology images. In this paper, we assume that deep learning-based pathological features imply the protein levels of tumor biomarkers that are indicative of prognosis and drug response. For this purpose, we propose wsi2rppa, a weakly supervised contrastive learning framework to infer the protein levels of tumor biomarkers from whole slide images (WSIs) in breast cancer. We first conducted contrastive learning-based pre-training on tessellated tiles to extract pathological features, which are then aggregated by attention pooling and adapted to downstream tasks. We conducted extensive evaluation experiments on the TCGA-BRCA cohort (1978 WSIs of 1093 patients with protein levels of 223 biomarkers) and the CPTAC-BRCA cohort (642 WSIs of 134 patients). The results showed that our method achieved state-of-the-art performance in tumor diagnostic tasks, and also performed well in predicting clinically relevant protein levels and drug response. To show the model interpretability, we spatially visualized the WSIs colored the tiles by their attention scores, and found that the regions with high scores were highly consistent with the tumor and necrotic regions annotated by a 10-year experienced pathologist. Moreover, spatial transcriptomic data further verified that the heatmap generated by attention scores agrees greatly with the spatial expression landscape of two typical tumor biomarker genes. In predicting the response to drug trastuzumab treatment, our method achieved a 0.79 AUC value which is much higher than the previous study reported 0.68. These findings showed the remarkable potential of computational pathology in the prediction of clinically relevant protein levels, drug response, and clinical outcomes.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare operations. Nevertheless, particularly in the context of preventive care, little is known about how laypeople perceive and accept AI and change their behavior accordingly. Grounded in a solid theoretical framework of trust, this study bridges this gap by exploring individuals' acceptance of AI-based preventive health interventions and following health behavior change, which is critical for preventive care providers' operational and business performance. Through a randomized field experiment with 15,000 users of a mobile health app complemented by a survey, we first show that the use and disclosure of AI in preventive health interventions improve their effectiveness. However, individuals are less likely to accept and achieve the health behavior change suggested by AI than when they receive similar interventions from health experts. We also observe that the effectiveness of AI-based interventions can be improved by combining them with human expert opinions, increasing their algorithmic transparency, or emphasizing their genuine care and warmth. These results collectively suggest that, different from conventional technologies, AI's deficient affective trust, rather than comparable cognitive trust, play a decisive role in the acceptance of AI-based preventive health interventions. This study sheds light on the literature on the role of new-age information technologies in behavioral operations management, consumer marketing, and healthcare as well as the role of trust in technology acceptance. Valuable practical implications for more effective management of AI for preventive care operations and promotion of consumers' health behavior are also provided.

AB  - Background Clinical risk prediction models (CRPMs) use patient characteristics to estimate the probability of having or developing a particular disease and/or outcome. While CRPMs are gaining in popularity, they have yet to be widely adopted in clinical practice. The lack of explainability and interpretability has limited their utility. Explainability is the extent of which a model's prediction process can be described. Interpretability is the degree to which a user can understand the predictions made by a model. Methods The study aimed to demonstrate utility of patient similarity analytics in developing an explainable and interpretable CRPM. Data was extracted from the electronic medical records of patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension and dyslipidaemia in a Singapore public primary care clinic. We used modified K-nearest neighbour which incorporated expert input, to develop a patient similarity model on this real-world training dataset (n = 7,041) and validated it on a testing dataset (n = 3,018). The results were compared using logistic regression, random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) models from the same dataset. The patient similarity model was then implemented in a prototype system to demonstrate the identification, explainability and interpretability of similar patients and the prediction process. Results The patient similarity model (AUROC = 0.718) was comparable to the logistic regression (AUROC = 0.695), RF (AUROC = 0.764) and SVM models (AUROC = 0.766). We packaged the patient similarity model in a prototype web application. A proof of concept demonstrated how the application provided both quantitative and qualitative information, in the form of patient narratives. This information was used to better inform and influence clinical decision-making, such as getting a patient to agree to start insulin therapy. Conclusions Patient similarity analytics is a feasible approach to develop an explainable and interpretable CRPM. While the approach is generalizable, it can be used to develop locally relevant information, based on the database it searches. Ultimately, such an approach can generate a more informative CRPMs which can be deployed as part of clinical decision support tools to better facilitate shared decision-making in clinical practice.

AB  - In wearable smart systems, continuous monitoring and accurate classification of dif-ferent sleep- related conditions are critical for enhancing sleep quality and preventing sleep- related chronic conditions. However, the requirements for device-skin coupling quality in electrophysiological sleep monitoring systems hinder the comfort and reli-ability of night wearing. Here, we report a washable, skin- compatible smart garment sleep monitoring system that captures local skin strain signals under weak device-skin coupling conditions without positioning or skin preparation requirements. A printed textile- based strain sensor array responds to strain from 0.1 to 10% with a gauge factor as high as 100 and shows independence to extrinsic motion artifacts via strain- isolating printed pattern design. Through reversible starching treatment, ink penetration depth during direct printing on garments is controlled to achieve batch- to- batch performance variation <10%. Coupled with deep learning, explainable AI, and transfer learning data processing, the smart garment is capable of classifying six sleep states with an accuracy of 98.6%, maintaining excellent explainability (classification with low bias) and generalization (95% accuracy on new users with few- shot learning less than 15 samples per class) in practical applications, paving the way for next- generation daily sleep healthcare management.

AB  - Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) occurs more frequently in cardiovascular patients than in the general population, significantly affecting morbidity and mortality. However, existing predictive models often lack sufficient accuracy and interpretability. We developed an interpretable and practical machine learning model to predict the risk of GIB in cardiology inpatients. This retrospective study analyzed electronic health records of 10,706 patients admitted to the Department of Cardiology at the Second Hospital of Lanzhou University from October 8, 2019, to October 30, 2024. Variables with > 30% missing data were excluded, leaving 35 potential predictors. The dataset was randomly split into a training cohort (80%, n = 9,356) and a test cohort (20%, n = 2,340). GIB occurred in 110 patients (1.03%). Ten variables were identified as the strongest predictors: hemoglobin (importance score: 0.16), creatinine (0.12), D-dimer (0.10), NT-proBNP (0.06), glucose (0.06), white blood cell count (0.06), body weight (0.06), serum albumin (0.04), urea (0.04), and age (0.04). Among seven machine learning classifiers, XGBoost performed best, with an AUC of 0.995 in the validation cohort. In the validation set, the model achieved an accuracy of 0.975, sensitivity of 0.769, and specificity of 0.996. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis confirmed hemoglobin, creatinine, and D-dimer as the top contributors to GIB risk. The model demonstrated excellent calibration (Brier score = 0.016), and decision curve analysis supported its clinical utility across various risk thresholds. The XGBoost model offers high accuracy and interpretability in predicting GIB risk among cardiology inpatients. It holds promise for clinical decision support by enabling early risk identification and personalized prevention strategies.

AB  - Although Germany continues to struggle with the digital transformation of healthcare, there is reason for optimism. The political will to improve healthcare with digital technologies has been underpinned by numerous legal initiatives since 2018. In addition, there is growing acceptance among healthcare providers and the population. The latter has clearly been driven by the corona pandemic, which underscored the need for more digitized care.Digitalization in healthcare has three key drivers: the rapid technological development in data processing, the ever-improving understanding of the biological basis of human life, and growing patient sovereignty coupled with a growing desire for transparency. Prerequisites for digital medicine are data interoperability and the establishment of a networking (telematics) infrastructure (TI). The status of the most important digital TI applications affecting German healthcare are described: the electronic patient record (ePA) as its core as well as electronic prescriptions, medication plans, and communication tools such as Communication in Medicine (KIM) and TI Messenger (TIM). In addition, various telemedical offerings are discussed as well as the introduction of digital health applications (DiGA) into the statutory healthcare system, which Germany has pioneered. Furthermore, the use of medical data as the basis for artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms is discussed. While helpful and capable of improving diagnostics as well as medical therapy, such AI tools will not replace doctors and nurses.

AB  - The integration of artificial intelligence in nursing practice presents significant ethical challenges that require a comprehensive assessment framework. This study aimed to develop and validate a scale to measure nurses' ethical awareness regarding the use of artificial intelligence in clinical settings. A two-phase methodological approach was employed, involving literature review and interviews for item generation, followed by psychometric evaluation. Data were collected using hand-delivered questionnaires from a convenience sample of 650 nurses. After excluding outliers, 646 responses were randomly split for exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. An initial pool of 36 items was refined to 21 items across six dimensions: data privacy and confidentiality, consent and autonomy, transparency and accountability, bias and equity, safety and professional integrity, and education and sustainability. Exploratory factor analysis identified a six-factor structure explaining 71.5% of the variance, which was confirmed by confirmatory factor analysis with strong model fit indices. The scale demonstrated excellent reliability (Cronbach's alpha = 0.90) and satisfactory validity. These findings indicate the scale is a reliable and valid tool to assess nurses' ethical awareness in the use of artificial intelligence.

AB  - The number of studies on deep learning for medical diagnosis is expanding, and these systems are often claimed to outperform clinicians. However, only a few systems have shown medical efficacy. From this perspective, we examine a wide range of deep learning algorithms for the assessment of glioblastoma - a common brain tumor in older adults that is lethal. Surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation are the standard treatments for glioblastoma patients. The methylation status of the MGMT promoter, a specific genetic sequence found in the tumor, affects chemotherapy's effectiveness. MGMT promoter methylation improves chemotherapy response and survival in several cancers. MGMT promoter methylation is determined by a tumor tissue biopsy, which is then genetically tested. This lengthy and invasive procedure increases the risk of infection and other complications. Thus, researchers have used deep learning models to examine the tumor from brain MRI scans to determine the MGMT promoter's methylation state. We employ deep learning models and one of the largest public MRI datasets of 585 participants to predict the methylation status of the MGMT promoter in glioblastoma tumors using MRI scans. We test these models using Grad-CAM, occlusion sensitivity, feature visualizations, and training loss landscapes. Our results show no correlation between these two, indicating that external cohort data should be used to verify these models' performance to assure the accuracy and reliability of deep learning systems in cancer diagnosis.

AB  - BackgroundAdvances in artificial intelligence and machine learning have facilitated the creation of mortality prediction models which are increasingly used to assess quality of care and inform clinical practice. One open question is whether a hospital should utilize a mortality model trained from a diverse nationwide dataset or use a model developed primarily from their local hospital data. ObjectiveTo compare performance of a single-hospital, 30-day all-cause mortality model against an established national benchmark on the task of mortality prediction. Design/ParticipantsWe developed a single-hospital mortality prediction model using 9975 consecutive inpatient admissions at the Department of Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Healthcare System from July 26, 2018, to September 30, 2021, and compared performance against an established national model with similar features. Main MeasuresBoth the single-hospital model and the national model placed each patient in one of five prediction bins: < 2.5%, 2.5-5%, 5-10%, 10-30%, and >= 30% risks of 30-day mortality. Evaluation metrics included receiver operator characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and balanced accuracy. Final comparisons were made between the single-hospital model trained on the full training set and the national model for both metrics and prediction overlap. Key ResultsWith sufficiently large training sets of 2720 or greater inpatient admissions, there was no statistically significant difference between the performances of the national model (ROC AUC 0.89, 95%CI [0.858, 0.919]) and single-hospital model (ROC AUC 0.878, 95%CI [0.84, 0.912]). For the 89 mortality events in the test set, the single-hospital model agreed with the national model risk assessment or an adjacent risk assessment in 92.1% of the encounters. ConclusionsA single-hospital inpatient mortality prediction model can achieve performance comparable to a national model when evaluated on a single-hospital population, given sufficient sample size.

AB  - Objectives: The adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is rapidly expanding, transforming areas such as diagnostics, drug discovery, and patient monitoring. Despite these advances, public perceptions of AI in healthcare, particularly in Canada, remain underexplored. This study investigates the relationship between Canadians' knowledge, comfort, and trust in AI, focusing on key sociodemographic factors like age, gender, education, and income. Study design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: Using data from the 2021 Canadian Digital Health Survey of 12,052 respondents, we employed ordinal logistic and multivariate polynomial regression analyses to uncover trends and disparities. Results: Findings reveal that women and older adults consistently report lower levels of knowledge and comfort with AI, with middle-aged women expressing the most significant discomfort. Comfort levels are closely tied to concerns over data privacy, especially regarding the use of identifiable personal health data. Healthcare professionals exhibited heightened discomfort with AI, indicating potential issues with trust in AI's reliability and ethical governance. Conclusions: Our results underscore that increasing knowledge alone does not necessarily lead to greater comfort with AI in healthcare. Addressing public concerns through robust data governance, transparency, and inclusive AI design is essential to fostering trust and successful integration of AI in healthcare systems.

AB  - Causal inference has recently gained notable attention across various fields like biology, healthcare, and environmental science, especially within explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) systems, for uncovering the causal relationships among multiple variables and outcomes. Yet, it has not been fully recognized and deployed in the manufacturing systems. In this paper, we introduce a scalable, and flexible Bayesian federated learning framework, xFBCI, designed to explore causality through treatment effect estimation in distributed manufacturing systems. By leveraging federated Bayesian learning, we efficiently estimate posterior of local parameters to derive the propensity score for each client without accessing local private data. These scores are then used to estimate the treatment effect using propensity score matching (PSM). Through simulations on various datasets and real-world Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printing data and smart manufacturing maintenance data, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms standard Bayesian causal inference methods and several state-of-the-art federated learning benchmarks.

AB  - With the increasing complexity and frequency of cyber attacks, organizations recognize the need for a proactive and targeted approach to safeguard their digital assets and operations. Every industry faces a distinct array of threats shaped by factors such as its industrial objective, geographic footprint, workforce size, revenue, partnerships, and the extent of its digital assets. This results in a wide heterogeneity in threat landscapes, which necessitates tailored threat intelligence sources. While some security practitioners may gravitate towards extensive sources, relying solely on volume-based solutions often leads to "alert fatigue". For this reason, organization-specific threat intelligence has acquired a growing importance in cybersecurity defense. This work presents a complete and novel framework called OSTIS (Organization-Specific Threat Intelligence System) for generating and managing organization-specific Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) data. Our approach identifies reliable security blogs from which we gather CTI data through a custom and focused Web Crawler. Relevant content from such sources is, then, identified and extracted using automated deep-learning models. Moreover, our AI-driven solution maps CTI data to specific domain scenarios, such as education, finance, government, healthcare, industrial control systems, and IoT. To validate and gain insights from the trained models, we also include an explainable AI (XAI, for short) task carried out by leveraging the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) tool. This allows us to interpret the prediction process and discern influential content from data. The last step of our framework consists of the generation of an Organization Specific Threat Intelligence Knowledge Graph (OSTIKG), empowering organizations to identify and visualize attack patterns and incidents, promptly. To create this graph, we develop and adapt several techniques to extract diverse entities, including malware groups, campaigns, attack types, malware types, software tools, and so forth, and to identify relationships among them. Finally, through an extensive experimental campaign, we certify the validity and performance of all the components of our framework, which shows a 0.84 F1-score in the identification of relevant content, a 0.93 F1-score for the domain classification, and a 0.95 and 0.89 F1-score in the identification of entities and relations to build our OSTIKG graph.

AB  - The article examines the foundational principles of biomedical ethics and their relevance to the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and biotechnological progress. It then analyzes the potential impact of the National Institutes of Health's (NIH or the Agency) proposed 2024 reorganization reforms, as presented by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce (E&C), and advocates for the inclusion of provisions that would enable the Agency to develop and deploy "safe, secure, and trustworthy" AI within the biotechnology sector. Thus, the article proposes two key integrative reforms to address these concerns: (1) enhancing research collaborations among healthcare systems, academic institutions, and the private sector through AI-driven platforms, and (2) establishing an NIH office to oversee AI-based health initiatives. These reforms would require legislative amendments, including updates to the Patent and Trademark Law Amendments Act of 1980 (Bayh-Dole Act or Bayh Dole) and the 21st Century Cures Act of 2016 (Cures Act), while adhering to biomedical ethics. Such amendments would ensure (1) ethical standards in collaborative research and development (R&D) among institutions and (2) effective health initiative design and implementation. In the same light, this article advocates for an updated legislative framework to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) that regulates the role of such integrative efforts and balances the transformative potential of AI in biotechnology. In all, these regulatory steps ensure that innovation benefits society while safeguarding individual rights such as personal data and privacy and mitigating algorithmic bias.

AB  - DNA sequencing with the quantum tunneling technique heralds a paradigm shift in genetic analysis, promising rapid and accurate identification for diverging applications ranging from personalized medicine to security issues. However, the widespread distribution of molecular conductance, conduction orbital alignment for resonant transport, and decoding crisscrossing conductance signals of isomorphic nucleotides have been persistent experimental hurdles for swift and precise identification. Herein, we have reported a machine learning (ML)-driven quantum tunneling study with solid-state model nanogap to determine nucleotides at single-base resolution. The optimized ML basecaller has demonstrated a high predictive basecalling accuracy of all four nucleotides from seven distinct data pools, each containing complex transmission readouts of their different dynamic conformations. ML classification of quaternary, ternary, and binary nucleotide combinations is also performed with high precision, sensitivity, and F1 score. ML explainability unravels the evidence of how extracted normalized features within overlapped nucleotide signals contribute to classification improvement. Moreover, electronic fingerprints, conductance sensitivity, and current readout analysis of nucleotides have promised practical applicability with significant sensitivity and distinguishability. Through this ML approach, our study pushes the boundaries of quantum sequencing by highlighting the effectiveness of single nucleotide basecalling with promising implications for advancing genomics and molecular diagnostics.

AB  - The utilization of large language models (LLMs) for Healthcare has generated both excitement and concern due to their ability to effectively respond to free-text queries with certain professional knowledge. This survey outlines the capabilities of the currently developed Healthcare LLMs and explicates their development process, to provide an overview of the development road map from traditional Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) to LLMs. Specifically, we first explore the potential of LLMs to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of various Healthcare applications highlighting both the strengths and limitations. Secondly, we conduct a comparison between the previous PLMs and the latest LLMs, and summarize related Healthcare training data, learning methods, and usage. Finally, the unique concerns associated with deploying LLMs are investigated, particularly regarding fairness, accountability, transparency, and ethics. Besides, we support researchers by compiling a collection of open-source resources1. Summarily, we contend that a significant paradigm shift is underway, transitioning from PLMs to LLMs. This shift encompasses a move from discriminative AI approaches to generative AI approaches, as well as a move from model-centered methodologies to datacentered methodologies. We determine that the biggest obstacle of using LLMs in Healthcare are fairness, accountability, transparency and ethics.

AB  - The aim of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is to design intelligent systems that can explain their predictions or recommendations to humans. Such systems are particularly desirable for therapeutic decision support, because physicians need to understand rcommendations to have confidence in their application and to adapt them if required, e.g. in case of patient contraindication. We propose here an explainable and visual approach for decision support in antibiotic treatment, based on an ontology. There were three steps to our method. We first generated a tabular dataset from the ontology, containing features defined on various domains and n-ary features. A preference model was then learned from patient profiles, antibiotic features and expert recommendations found in clinical practice guidelines. This model made the implicit rationale of the expert explicit, including the way in which missing data was treated. We then visualized the preference model and its application to all antibiotics available on the market for a given clinical situation, using rainbow boxes, a recently developed technique for set visualization. The resulting preference model had an error rate of 3.5% on the learning data, and 5.2% on test data (10-fold validation). These findings suggest that our system can help physicians to prescribe antibiotics correctly, even for clinical situations not present in the guidelines (e.g. due to allergies or contraindications for the recommended treatment).

AB  - Healthcare fraud detection algorithms are mostly based on applying machine learning methods to payer-claims data transactions to detect fraudulent activities. However, claim transactions are often analyzed in isolation, disregarding the interconnections that naturally exist in the claims generated from a single unit such as the patient, payer, or provider. Fraud detection frameworks have untapped potential to aid downstream processes such as investigations and audits through transparent and interpretable machine learning models. In this study, we show how fraud detection frameworks can benefit from use of a graphical network model called Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) which exploits the relational structure of attributes in a transaction and has better interpretability properties than many competing machine learning methods. BBN model performance is found to be comparable to commonly utilized baseline models such as logistic regression and random forest after validation with a real-life insurance claims dataset. In particular, the F1 score of fraud class for the best performing BBN was 0.15. The proposed BBN model is also considered to be interpretable to auditors and investigators based on common sense qualitative evaluation.

AB  - In recent years, machine learning methods have been rapidly adopted in the medical domain. However, current state-of-the-art medical mining methods usually produce opaque, black-box models. To address the lack of model transparency, substantial attention has been given to developing interpretable machine learning models. In the medical domain, counterfactuals can provide example-based explanations for predictions, and show practitioners the modifications required to change a prediction from an undesired to a desired state. In this paper, we propose a counterfactual solution MedSeqCF for preventing the mortality of three cohorts of ICU patients, by representing their electronic health records as medical event sequences, and generating counterfactuals by adopting and employing a text style-transfer technique. We propose three model augmentations for MedSeqCF to integrate additional medical knowledge for generating more trustworthy counterfactuals. Experimental results on the MIMIC-III dataset strongly suggest that augmented style-transfer methods can be effectively adapted for the problem of counterfactual explanations in healthcare applications and can further improve the model performance in terms of validity, BLEU-4, local outlier factor, and edit distance. In addition, our qualitative analysis of the results by consultation with medical experts suggests that our style-transfer solutions can generate clinically relevant and actionable counterfactual explanations.

AB  - Healthcare recommendations and insurance have recently been one of the most emerging research areas in health informatics. The fraud in health insurance is becoming increasingly common day by day. To handle healthcare insurance fraud, there is an urgent need for an intelligent system that cannot only identify and monitor doctors' and hospitals' behavior regarding the health services they provide to patients but can also recommend doctors and hospitals to insured employees based on the quality of services they provided previously. This system creates patient and doctor profiles separately, based on their rating. The proposed system combines singular value decomposition (SVD), K-nearest neighbors based collaborative filtering (KNN-based CF), item-based collaborative filtering (Item-based CF), content-based filtering using term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), and K-means clustering and probability distributions to recommend doctors and insurance plans. The system measures similarity scores between patients and doctors using cosine similarity, which helps to determine similarity scores and refine the recommendations. This study also uses blockchain technology to automate insurance claims reimbursement. The results are validated using real data from the employees of a local hospital. The system provides recommendations with a root mean square error (RMSE) value of 0.478 and a mean absolute error (MAE) value of 0.0422. The insurance plans developed using the proposed system have reduced the overall expenditure of the local hospital, with a reduction in total expenses. Blockchain technology further helps prevent healthcare fraud. In the proposed system, a healthcare insurance claims reimbursement system is built using smart contract technology on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring security & transparency and lowering the number of healthcare frauds. The system includes roles for the insurance company, healthcare provider, and patients. It also provides a platform for claim submission, approval, or refusal. In Pakistan, no such system existed before recommending doctors from different hospitals based on their professional conduct or the good health services they provide.

AB  - Patient satisfaction is a key performance indicator of patient-centered care and hospital reimbursement. To discover the major factors that affect patient experiences is considered as an effective way to formulate corrective actions. A patient during his/her healthcare journey interacts with multiple health professionals across different service units. The health-related data generated at each step of the journey is a valuable resource for extracting actionable insights. In particular, self-reported satisfaction survey and the associated patient electronic health records play an important role in the hospital-patient interaction analysis. In this paper, we propose an interpretable machine learning framework to formulate the patient satisfaction problem as a supervised learning task and utilize a mixed-integer programming model to identify the most influential factors. The proposed framework transforms heterogeneous data into human-understandable features and integrates feature transformation, variable selection, and coefficient learning into the optimization process. Therefore, it can achieve desirable model performance while maintaining excellent model interpretability, which paves the way for successful real-world applications.

AB  - Featured Application A new algorithm that uses self-organizing maps and entropy calculus to generate a tree structure based on XAI software principles. Data classification is an automatic or semi-automatic process that, utilizing artificial intelligence algorithms, learns the variable and class relationships of a dataset for use a posteriori in situations where the class result is unknown. For many years, work on this topic has been aimed at increasing the hit rates of algorithms. However, when the problem is restricted to applications in healthcare, besides the concern with performance, it is also necessary to design algorithms whose results are understandable by the specialists responsible for making the decisions. Among the problems in the field of medicine, a current focus is related to COVID-19: AI algorithms may contribute to early diagnosis. Among the available COVID-19 data, the blood test is a typical procedure performed when the patient seeks the hospital, and its use in the diagnosis allows reducing the need for other diagnostic tests that can impact the detection time and add to costs. In this work, we propose using self-organizing map (SOM) to discover attributes in blood test examinations that are relevant for COVID-19 diagnosis. We applied SOM and an entropy calculation in the definition of a hierarchical, semi-supervised and explainable model named TESSOM (tree-based entropy-structured self-organizing maps), in which the main feature is enhancing the investigation of groups of cases with high levels of class overlap, as far as the diagnostic outcome is concerned. Framing the TESSOM algorithm in the context of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) makes it possible to explain the results to an expert in a simplified way. It is demonstrated in the paper that the use of the TESSOM algorithm to identify attributes of blood tests can help with the identification of COVID-19 cases. It providing a performance increase in 1.489% in multiple scenarios when analyzing 2207 cases from three hospitals in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. This work is a starting point for researchers to identify relevant attributes of blood tests for COVID-19 and to support the diagnosis of other diseases.

AB  - The study aimed to develop and validate a sepsis prediction model using structured electronic medical records (sEMR) and machine learning (ML) methods in emergency triage. The goal was to enhance early sepsis screening by integrating comprehensive triage information beyond vital signs. This retrospective cohort study utilized data from the MIMIC-IV database. Two models were developed: Model 1 based on vital signs alone, and Model 2 incorporating vital signs, demographic characteristics, medical history, and chief complaints. Eight ML algorithms were employed, and model performance was evaluated using metrics such as AUC, F1 Score, and calibration curves. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) methods were used to enhance model interpretability. The study included 189,617 patients, with 5.95% diagnosed with sepsis. Model 2 consistently outperformed Model 1 across most algorithms. In Model 2, Gradient Boosting achieved the highest AUC of 0.83, followed by Extra Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (all 0.82). The SHAP method provided more comprehensible explanations for the Gradient Boosting algorithm. Modeling with comprehensive triage information using sEMR and ML methods was more effective in predicting sepsis at triage compared to using vital signs alone. Interpretable ML enhanced model transparency and provided sepsis prediction probabilities, offering a feasible approach for early sepsis screening and aiding healthcare professionals in making informed decisions during the triage process.

AB  - Background and objective: The value of implementing artificial intelligence (AI) on ultrasound screening for thyroid cancer has been acknowledged, with numerous early studies confirming AI might help physi-cians acquire more accurate diagnoses. However, the black box nature of AI's decision-making process makes it difficult for users to grasp the foundation of AI's predictions. Furthermore, explainability is not only related to AI performance, but also responsibility and risk in medical diagnosis. In this paper, we offer Explainer, an intrinsically explainable framework that can categorize images and create heatmaps highlighting the regions on which its prediction is based. Methods: A dataset of 19341 thyroid ultrasound images with pathological results and physician -annotated TI-RADS features is used to train and test the robustness of the proposed framework. Then we conducted a benign-malignant classification study to determine whether physicians perform better with the assistance of an explainer than they do alone or with Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM). Results: Reader studies show that the Explainer can achieve a more accurate diagnosis while explaining heatmaps, and that physicians' performances are improved when assisted by the Explainer. Case study results confirm that the Explainer is capable of locating more reasonable and feature-related regions than the Grad-CAM. Conclusions: The Explainer offers physicians a tool to understand the basis of AI predictions and evaluate their reliability, which has the potential to unbox the "black box" of medical imaging AI.

AB  - Background Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into healthcare has raised significant ethical concerns. In pharmacy practice, AI offers promising advances but also poses ethical challenges. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in countries from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region on 501 pharmacy professionals. A 12-item online questionnaire assessed ethical concerns related to the adoption of AI in pharmacy practice. Demographic factors associated with ethical concerns were analyzed via SPSS v.27 software using appropriate statistical tests. Results Participants expressed concerns about patient data privacy (58.9%), cybersecurity threats (58.9%), potential job displacement (62.9%), and lack of legal regulation (67.0%). Tech-savviness and basic AI understanding were correlated with higher concern scores (p < 0.001). Ethical implications include the need for informed consent, beneficence, justice, and transparency in the use of AI. Conclusion The findings emphasize the importance of ethical guidelines, education, and patient autonomy in adopting AI. Collaboration, data privacy, and equitable access are crucial to the responsible use of AI in pharmacy practice.

KW  - SIGNATURE
AB  - Motivation Classification of samples using biomedical omics data is a widely used method in biomedical research. However, these datasets often possess challenging characteristics, including high dimensionality, limited sample sizes, and inherent biases across diverse sources. These factors limit the performance of traditional machine learning models, particularly when applied to independent datasets.Results To address these challenges, we propose a novel classifier, Deep Centroid, which combines the stability of the nearest centroid classifier and the strong fitting ability of the deep cascade strategy. Deep Centroid is an ensemble learning method with a multi-layer cascade structure, consisting of feature scanning and cascade learning stages that can dynamically adjust the training scale. We apply Deep Centroid to three precision medicine applications-cancer early diagnosis, cancer prognosis, and drug sensitivity prediction-using cell-free DNA fragmentations, gene expression profiles, and DNA methylation data. Experimental results demonstrate that Deep Centroid outperforms six traditional machine learning models in all three applications, showcasing its potential in biological omics data classification. Furthermore, functional annotations reveal that the features scanned by the model exhibit biological significance, indicating its interpretability from a biological perspective. Our findings underscore the promising application of Deep Centroid in the classification of biomedical omics data, particularly in the field of precision medicine.Availability and implementation Deep Centroid is available at both github (github.com/xiexiexiekuan/DeepCentroid) and Figshare (https://figshare.com/articles/software/Deep_Centroid_A_General_Deep_Cascade_Classifier_for_Biomedical_Omics_Data_Classification/24993516).

AB  - Photoacoustic (PA) imaging has the potential to revolutionize functional medical imaging in healthcare due to the valuable information on tissue physiology contained in multispectral photoacoustic measurements. Clinical translation of the technology requires conversion of the high-dimensional acquired data into clinically relevant and interpretable information. In this work, we present a deep learning-based approach to semantic segmentation of multispectral photoacoustic images to facilitate image interpretability. Manually annotated photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging data are used as reference and enable the training of a deep learning-based segmentation algorithm in a supervised manner. Based on a validation study with experimentally acquired data from 16 healthy human volunteers, we show that automatic tissue segmentation can be used to create powerful analyses and visualizations of multispectral photoacoustic images. Due to the intuitive representation of high-dimensional information, such a preprocessing algorithm could be a valuable means to facilitate the clinical translation of photoacoustic imaging.

AB  - Simple Summary Early detection of melanoma and differentiation from benign nevi can be challenging even for the most experienced dermatologists. To improve melanoma detection, artificial intelligence algorithms incorporating dermoscopy have been developed, but lack transparency and therefore have limited training value for healthcare providers. To address this, an automated approach utilizing imaging biomarker cues (IBCs), logical features extracted from images that mimic expert dermatologists' dermoscopic pattern recognition skills, was developed. This study excluded deep learning approaches to which IBCs are complementary or alternative. Ten participants assessed 78 dermoscopic images (39 melanomas and 39 nevi) first without IBCs and then with IBCs. Using IBCs significantly improved diagnostic accuracy: sensitivity increased significantly from 73.69% to 81.57% (p = 0.0051) and specificity increased from 60.50% to 67.25% (p = 0.059). These results indicate that incorporating IBCs can significantly enhance melanoma diagnosis, with potential implications for improved screening practices. Further research is needed to confirm these findings across a variety of healthcare providers.Abstract Incorporation of dermoscopy and artificial intelligence (AI) is improving healthcare professionals' ability to diagnose melanoma earlier, but these algorithms often suffer from a "black box" issue, where decision-making processes are not transparent, limiting their utility for training healthcare providers. To address this, an automated approach for generating melanoma imaging biomarker cues (IBCs), which mimics the screening cues used by expert dermoscopists, was developed. This study created a one-minute learning environment where dermatologists adopted a sensory cue integration algorithm to combine a single IBC with a risk score built on many IBCs, then immediately tested their performance in differentiating melanoma from benign nevi. Ten participants evaluated 78 dermoscopic images, comprised of 39 melanomas and 39 nevi, first without IBCs and then with IBCs. Participants classified each image as melanoma or nevus in both experimental conditions, enabling direct comparative analysis through paired data. With IBCs, average sensitivity improved significantly from 73.69% to 81.57% (p = 0.0051), and the average specificity improved from 60.50% to 67.25% (p = 0.059) for the diagnosis of melanoma. The index of discriminability (d ') increased significantly by 0.47 (p = 0.002). Therefore, the incorporation of IBCs can significantly improve physicians' sensitivity in melanoma diagnosis. While more research is needed to validate this approach across other healthcare providers, its use may positively impact melanoma screening practices.

AB  - Background: Accurate diagnosis of acute appendicitis in children remains challenging due to variable presentations and limitations of existing clinical scoring systems. While machine learning (ML) offers a promising approach to enhance diagnostic precision, most prior studies have been limited by small sample sizes, single-center data, or a lack of external validation. Methods: This prospective, multicenter study included 8586 pediatric patients to develop a machine learning-based diagnostic model using routinely available clinical and hematological parameters. A separate, prospectively collected external validation cohort of 3000 patients was used to assess model performance. The Random Forest algorithm was selected based on its superior performance during model comparison. Diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, Area Under Curve (AUC), and calibration metrics were evaluated and compared with traditional scoring systems such as Pediatric Appendicitis Score (PAS), Alvarado, and Appendicitis Inflammatory Response Score (AIRS). Results: The ML model outperformed traditional clinical scores in both development and validation cohorts. In the external validation set, the Random Forest model achieved an AUC of 0.996, accuracy of 0.992, sensitivity of 0.998, and specificity of 0.993. Feature-importance analysis identified white blood cell count, red blood cell count, and mean platelet volume as key predictors. Conclusions: This large, prospectively validated study demonstrates that a machine learning-based scoring system using commonly accessible data can significantly improve the diagnosis of pediatric appendicitis. The model offers high accuracy and clinical interpretability and has the potential to reduce diagnostic delays and unnecessary imaging.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the adherence of large language model (LLM)-based healthcare research to the Minimum Reporting Items for Clear Evaluation of Accuracy Reports of Large Language Models in Healthcare (MI-CLEAR-LLM) checklist, a framework designed to enhance the transparency and reproducibility of studies on the accuracy of LLMs for medical applications. Materials and Methods: A systematic PubMed search was conducted to identify articles on LLM performance published in high-ranking clinical medicine journals (the top 10% in each of the 59 specialties according to the 2023 Journal Impact Factor) from November 30, 2022, through June 25, 2024. Data on the six MI-CLEAR-LLM checklist items: 1) identification and specification of the LLM used, 2) stochasticity handling, 3) prompt wording and syntax, 4) prompt structuring, 5) prompt testing and optimization, and 6) independence of the test data-were independently extracted by two reviewers, and adherence was calculated for each item. Results: Of 159 studies, 100% (159/159) reported the name of the LLM, 96.9% (154/159) reported the version, and 91.8% documented access to web-based information, and 50.9% (81/159) provided the date of the query attempts. Clear documentation regarding stochasticity management was provided in 15.1% (24/159) of the studies. Regarding prompt details, 49.1% (78/159) provided exact prompt wording and syntax but only 34.0% (54/159) documented prompt-structuring practices. While 46.5% (74/159) of the studies detailed prompt testing, only 15.7% (25/159) explained the rationale for specific word choices. Test data independence was reported for only 13.2% (21/159) of the studies, and 56.6% (43/76) provided URLs for internet-sourced test data. Conclusion: Although basic LLM identification details were relatively well reported, other key aspects, including stochasticity, prompts, and test data, were frequently underreported. Enhancing adherence to the MI-CLEAR-LLM checklist will allow LLM research to achieve greater transparency and will foster more credible and reliable future studies.

AB  - Objective: The development of machine learning (ML) algorithms to address a variety of issues faced in clinical practice has increased rapidly. However, questions have arisen regarding biases in their development that can affect their applicability in specific populations. We sought to evaluate whether studies developing ML models from electronic health record (EHR) data report sufficient demographic data on the study populations to demonstrate representativeness and reproducibility.
   Materials and Methods: We searched PubMed for articles applying ML models to improve clinical decision-making using EHR data. We limited our search to papers published between 2015 and 2019.
   Results: Across the 164 studies reviewed, demographic variables were inconsistently reported and/or included as model inputs. Race/ethnicity was not reported in 64%; gender and age were not reported in 24% and 21% of studies, respectively. Socioeconomic status of the population was not reported in 92% of studies. Studies that mentioned these variables often did not report if they were included as model inputs. Few models (12%) were validated using external populations. Few studies (17%) open-sourced their code. Populations in the ML studies include higher proportions of White and Black yet fewer Hispanic subjects compared to the general US population.
   Discussion: The demographic characteristics of study populations are poorly reported in the ML literature based on EHR data. Demographic representativeness in training data and model transparency is necessary to ensure that ML models are deployed in an equitable and reproducible manner. Wider adoption of reporting guidelines is warranted to improve representativeness and reproducibility.

AB  - Background The need for transparency and interpretability is a fundamental theme to be addressed by Artificial Intelligence (AI) research, especially in high-risk applications such as healthcare. In this work, we propose Fuzzy Sets in Probability Trees (FPT), a novel method that combines probabilistic trees and fuzzy logic.This approach is fully interpretable, providing clinicians with a tool generate and verify the entire clinical decision process. Methods FPT extends the existing framework of Probabilistic Decision Trees by incorporating the uncertainty in the data, allowing fora flexible description of vague variables. Thus, FPTs enable the incorporation of domain knowledge in the form of fuzzy membership functions within the framework of probabilistic trees. Furthermore, FPTs can represent circumstances or explanations that cannot be represented with other techniques (e.g., Bayesian networks), paving the way to a novel form of interpretable AI that allows clinicians to generate, control and verify the entire diagnosis procedure; one of the strengths of our methodology is the capability to decrease the frequency of misdiagnoses by providing an estimate of uncertainties and counterfactuals. Results We applied FPTto two real medical scenarios: classifying malignant thyroid nodules, and predicting the risk of progression in chronic kidney disease patients. Our results show that FPTs can provide interpretable support to clinicians. We also show that FPT and its predictions can assist clinical practice in an intuitive manner, with the use of a user-friendly interface specifically designed for this purpose. Conclusion The integration of probabilistic trees and fuzzy reasoning preserves the nuances that are generally lost in (probabilistic) decision trees due to the adoption of crisp thresholds, leading to hybrid trees that provide an AI system better aligned with human reasoning processes and that can effectively support clinicians in the diagnosis decision process.

AB  - Background Rates of childhood mental health problems are increasing in the UK. Early identification of childhood mental health problems is challenging but critical to children's future psychosocial development. This is particularly important for children with social care contact because earlier identification can facilitate earlier intervention. Clinical prediction tools could improve these early intervention efforts.Aims Characterise a novel cohort consisting of children in social care and develop effective machine learning models for prediction of childhood mental health problems.Method We used linked, de-identified data from the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage Databank to create a cohort of 26 820 children in Wales, UK, receiving social care services. Integrating health, social care and education data, we developed several machine learning models aimed at predicting childhood mental health problems. We assessed the performance, interpretability and fairness of these models.Results Risk factors strongly associated with childhood mental health problems included age, substance misuse and being a looked after child. The best-performing model, a gradient boosting classifier, achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.75 (95% CI 0.73-0.78). Assessments of algorithmic fairness showed potential biases within these models.Conclusions Machine learning performance on this prediction task was promising. Predictive performance in social care settings can be bolstered by linking diverse routinely collected data-sets, making available a range of heterogenous risk factors relating to clinical, social and environmental exposures.

AB  - Predicting blastocyst formation poses significant challenges in reproductive medicine and critically influences clinical decision-making regarding extended embryo culture. While previous research has primarily focused on determining whether an IVF cycle can produce at least one blastocyst, less attention has been given to quantifying blastocyst yields. This study aims to develop and validate such a quantitative predictive tool for IVF cycles. We employed three machine learning models-SVM, LightGBM, and XGBoost-which demonstrated comparable performance and outperformed traditional linear regression models (R2: 0.673-0.676 vs. 0.587, Mean absolute error: 0.793-0.809 vs. 0.943). Ultimately, LightGBM emerged as the optimal model, due to utilizing fewer features (8 vs. 10-11 in SVM/XGBoost) and offering superior interpretability. We then stratified predictions and actual yields into three categories (0, 1-2, and >= 3 blastocysts) to evaluate the model's discriminative performance. In this multi-classification task, LightGBM demonstrated robust accuracy (0.675-0.71) with fair-to-moderate agreement (kappa coefficients: 0.365-0.5) across both the overall cohort and poor-prognosis subgroups. Feature importance analysis identified three critical predictors: the number of extended culture embryos, the mean cell number on Day 3, and the proportion of 8-cell embryos. By leveraging the potential of machine learning, this research provides clinicians with valuable insights for making individualized decisions regarding extended embryo culture.

AB  - Introduction Recent advances in artificial intelligence have created opportunities for medical anomaly detection through multimodal learning frameworks. However, traditional systems struggle to capture the complex temporal and semantic relationships in clinical data, limiting generalization and interpretability in real-world settings.Methods To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that integrates symbolic representations, a graph-based neural model (PathoGraph), and a knowledge-guided refinement strategy. The approach leverages structured clinical records, temporally evolving symptom graphs, and medical ontologies to build semantically interpretable latent spaces. Our method enhances model robustness under sparse supervision and distributional shifts.Results Extensive experiments across electronic health records and diagnostic datasets show that our model outperforms existing baselines in detecting rare comorbidity patterns and abnormal treatment responses.Discussion Additionally, it improves interpretability and trustworthiness, which are critical for clinical deployment. By aligning domain knowledge with multimodal AI, our work contributes a generalizable and explainable solution to healthcare anomaly detection.

AB  - BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Numerous factors have been associated with the survival outcomes in patients with spinal cord gliomas (SCG). Recognizing these specific determinants is crucial, yet it is also vital to establish a reliable and precise prognostic model for estimating individual survival outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study are twofold: first, to create an array of interpretable machine learning (ML) models developed for predicting survival outcomes among SCG patients; and second, to integrate these models into an easily navigable online calculator to showcase their prospective clinical applicability. STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective, population-based cohort study aiming to predict the outcomes of interest, which were binary categorical variables, in SCG patients with ML models. PATIENT SAMPLE: The National Cancer Database (NCDB) was utilized to identify adults aged 18 years or older who were diagnosed with histologically confirmed SCGs between 2010 and 2019. OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcomes of interest were survival outcomes at three specific time points postdiagnosis: 1, 3, and 5 years. These outcomes were formed by combining the "Vital Status" and "Last Contact or Death (Months from Diagnosis)" variables. Model performance was evaluated visually and numerically. The visual evaluation utilized receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, precision-recall curves (PRCs), and calibration curves. The numerical evaluation involved metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, area under the PRC (AUPRC), area under the ROC curve (AUROC), and Brier Score. METHODS: We employed five ML algorithms - TabPFN, CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Random Forest - along with the Optuna library for hyperparameter optimization. The models that yielded the highest AUROC values were chosen for integration into the online calculator. To enhance the explicability of our models, we utilized SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) for assessing the relative significance of predictor variables and incorporated partial dependence plots (PDPs) to delineate the influence of singular variables on the predictions made by the top performing models. RESULTS: For the 1-year survival analysis, 4,913 patients [5.6% with 1-year mortality]; for the 3year survival analysis, 4,027 patients (11.5% with 3-year mortality]; and for the 5-year survival analysis, 2,854 patients (20.4% with 5-year mortality) were included. The top models achieved AUROCs of 0.938 for 1-year mortality (TabPFN), 0.907 for 3-year mortality (LightGBM), and 0.902 for 5-year mortality (Random Forest). Global SHAP analyses across survival outcomes at different time points identified histology, tumor grade, age, surgery, radiotherapy, and tumor size as the most significant predictor variables for the top -performing models. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates ML techniques can develop highly accurate prognostic models for SCG patients with excellent discriminatory ability. The interactive online calculator provides a tool for assessment by physicians (https://huggingface.co/spaces/MSHS-NeurosurgeryResearch/NCDB-SCG). Local interpretability informs prediction influences for a given individual. External validation across diverse datasets could further substantiate potential utility and generalizability. This robust, interpretable methodology aligns with the goals of precision medicine, establishing a foundation for continued research leveraging ML's predictive power to enhance patient counseling.

AB  - Early detection of malignant thyroid nodules is crucial for effective treatment, but traditional diagnostic methods face challenges such as variability in expert opinions and limited integration of advanced imaging techniques. This prospective cohort study investigates a novel multimodal approach, integrating traditional methods with advanced machine learning techniques. We studied 181 patients who underwent fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy, each contributing one nodule, resulting in a total of 181 nodules for our analysis. Data collection included sex, age, and ultrasound imaging, which incorporated elastography. Features extracted from these images included Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TIRADS) scores, elastography parameters, and radiomic features. The pathological results based on the FNA biopsy, provided by the pathologists, served as our gold standard for nodule classification. Our methodology, termed ELTIRADS, combines these features with interpretable machine learning techniques. Performance evaluation showed that a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier using TIRADS, elastography data, and radiomic features achieved high accuracy (0.92), with sensitivity (0.89), specificity (0.94), precision (0.89), and F1 score (0.89). To enhance interpretability, we used hierarchical clustering, shapley additive explanations (SHAP), and partial dependence plots (PDP). This combined approach holds promise for enhancing the accuracy of thyroid nodule malignancy detection, thereby contributing to advancements in personalized and precision medicine in the field of thyroid cancer research.

AB  - The healthcare industry seeks to integrate AI into clinical applications, yet understanding AI decision making remains a challenge for healthcare practitioners as these systems often function as black boxes. Our work benchmarks the Pattern Discovery and Disentanglement (PDD) system's unsupervised learning algorithm, which provides interpretable outputs and clustering results from clinical notes to aid decision making. Using the MIMIC-IV dataset, we process free-text clinical notes and ICD-9 codes with Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency and Topic Modeling. The PDD algorithm discretizes numerical features into event-based features, discovers association patterns from a disentangled statistical feature value association space, and clusters clinical records. The output is an interpretable knowledge base linking knowledge, patterns, and data to support decision making. Despite being unsupervised, PDD demonstrated performance comparable to supervised deep learning models, validating its clustering ability and knowledge representation. We benchmark interpretability techniques-Feature Permutation, Gradient SHAP, and Integrated Gradients-on the best-performing models (in terms of F1, ROC AUC, balanced accuracy, etc.), evaluating these based on sufficiency, comprehensiveness, and sensitivity metrics. Our findings highlight the limitations of feature importance ranking and post hoc analysis for clinical diagnosis. Meanwhile, PDD's global interpretability effectively compensates for these issues, helping healthcare practitioners understand the decision-making process and providing suggestive clusters of diseases to assist their diagnosis.

AB  - PurposeAs of March 2023, the number of patients with COVID-19 worldwide is declining, but the early diagnosis of patients requiring inpatient treatment and the appropriate allocation of limited healthcare resources remain unresolved issues. In this study we constructed a deep-learning (DL) model to predict the need for oxygen supplementation using clinical information and chest CT images of patients with COVID-19.Materials and methodsWe retrospectively enrolled 738 patients with COVID-19 for whom clinical information (patient background, clinical symptoms, and blood test findings) was available and chest CT imaging was performed. The initial data set was divided into 591 training and 147 evaluation data. We developed a DL model that predicted oxygen supplementation by integrating clinical information and CT images. The model was validated at two other facilities (n = 191 and n = 230). In addition, the importance of clinical information for prediction was assessed.ResultsThe proposed DL model showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 89.9% for predicting oxygen supplementation. Validation from the two other facilities showed an AUC > 80%. With respect to interpretation of the model, the contribution of dyspnea and the lactate dehydrogenase level was higher in the model.ConclusionsThe DL model integrating clinical information and chest CT images had high predictive accuracy. DL-based prediction of disease severity might be helpful in the clinical management of patients with COVID-19.

AB  - The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into healthcare marks a paradigmatic shift, raising not only technical and organizational challenges but also profound ethical questions. This theoretical-reflective paper explores the ethical dimensions of AI from a nursing perspective, focusing on the role of nurse leaders as ethical agents in the digital transformation of care. Drawing on philosophical and ethical frameworks, such as Heidegger's notion of humans as "sensors of machines" and the concept of algorethics, the article argues that AI should not replace the relational, interpretive, and moral dimensions of care, but rather support them, provided its implementation is guided by ethical vigilance. The World Health Organization's principles-autonomy, beneficence, transparency, accountability, justice, and sustainability-serve as the ethical foundation for AI in healthcare, highlighting the need to preserve human dignity and prevent discrimination. Yet algorithmic opacity, automation bias, and data-driven inequities demand renewed attention to responsibility, explainability, and the preservation of human agency. Nurse leaders are called to act along three ethical pillars: fostering transparency in algorithmic processes, ensuring shared responsibility for AI-supported decisions, and sustaining human relationships as the core of care. By reclaiming relational time (kairos) and resisting the delegation of moral judgment to machines, nurses safeguard the human face of care. In doing so, they embody a leadership rooted in presence, justice, and ethical discernment. Ultimately, this paper calls for a proactive governance of AI that anticipates its impacts and ensures its alignment with the telos of nursing: to care for persons with competence, conscience, and compassion.

AB  - In recent years, data-driven, deep-learning-based models have shown great promise in medical risk prediction. By utilizing the large-scale Electronic Health Record data found in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States, we have developed an automated, personalized risk prediction model to support the clinical decision-making process for localized prostate cancer patients. This method combines the representative power of deep learning and the analytical interpretability of parametric regression models and can implement both time-dependent and static input data. To collect a comprehensive evaluation of model performances, we calculate time-dependent C-statistics C-td over 2-, 5-, and 10-year time horizons using either a composite outcome or prostate cancer mortality as the target event. The composite outcome combines the Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) test, metastasis, and prostate cancer mortality. Our longitudinal model Recurrent Deep Survival Machine (RDSM) achieved C-td 0.85 (0.83), 0.80 (0.83), and 0.76 (0.81), while the cross-sectional model Deep Survival Machine (DSM) attained C-td 0.85 (0.82), 0.80 (0.82), and 0.76 (0.79) for the 2-, 5-, and 10-year composite (mortality) outcomes, respectively. In addition to estimating the survival probability, our method can quantify the uncertainty associated with the prediction. The uncertainty scores show a consistent correlation with the prediction accuracy. We find PSA and prostate cancer stage information are the most important indicators in risk prediction. Our work demonstrates the utility of the data-driven machine learning model in prostate cancer risk prediction, which can play a critical role in the clinical decision system.

AB  - Understanding the reasons behind the decisions of complex intelligent systems is crucial in many domains, especially in healthcare. Local explanation models analyse a decision on a single instance, by using the responses of the system to the points in its neighbourhood to build a surrogate model. This work makes a comparative analysis of the local explanations provided by two rule-based explanation methods on RETIPROGRAM, a system based on a fuzzy random forest that analyses the health record of a diabetic person to assess his/her degree of risk of developing diabetic retinopathy. The analysed explanation methods are C-LORE-F (a variant of LORE that builds a decision tree) and DRSA (a method based on rough sets that builds a set of rules). The explored methods gave good results in several metrics, although there is room for improvement in the generation of counterfactual examples.

AB  - BackgroundTuberculosis spondylitis (TS), commonly known as Pott's disease, is a severe type of skeletal tuberculosis that typically requires surgical treatment. However, this treatment option has led to an increase in healthcare costs due to prolonged hospital stays (PLOS). Therefore, identifying risk factors associated with extended PLOS is necessary. In this research, we intended to develop an interpretable machine learning model that could predict extended PLOS, which can provide valuable insights for treatments and a web-based application was implemented.MethodsWe obtained patient data from the spine surgery department at our hospital. Extended postoperative length of stay (PLOS) refers to a hospitalization duration equal to or exceeding the 75th percentile following spine surgery. To identify relevant variables, we employed several approaches, such as the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), recursive feature elimination (RFE) based on support vector machine classification (SVC), correlation analysis, and permutation importance value. Several models using implemented and some of them are ensembled using soft voting techniques. Models were constructed using grid search with nested cross-validation. The performance of each algorithm was assessed through various metrics, including the AUC value (area under the curve of receiver operating characteristics) and the Brier Score. Model interpretation involved utilizing methods such as Shapley additive explanations (SHAP), the Gini Impurity Index, permutation importance, and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME). Furthermore, to facilitate the practical application of the model, a web-based interface was developed and deployed.ResultsThe study included a cohort of 580 patients and 11 features include (CRP, transfusions, infusion volume, blood loss, X-ray bone bridge, X-ray osteophyte, CT-vertebral destruction, CT-paravertebral abscess, MRI-paravertebral abscess, MRI-epidural abscess, postoperative drainage) were selected. Most of the classifiers showed better performance, where the XGBoost model has a higher AUC value (0.86) and lower Brier Score (0.126). The XGBoost model was chosen as the optimal model. The results obtained from the calibration and decision curve analysis (DCA) plots demonstrate that XGBoost has achieved promising performance. After conducting tenfold cross-validation, the XGBoost model demonstrated a mean AUC of 0.85 +/- 0.09. SHAP and LIME were used to display the variables' contributions to the predicted value. The stacked bar plots indicated that infusion volume was the primary contributor, as determined by Gini, permutation importance (PFI), and the LIME algorithm.ConclusionsOur methods not only effectively predicted extended PLOS but also identified risk factors that can be utilized for future treatments. The XGBoost model developed in this study is easily accessible through the deployed web application and can aid in clinical research.

AB  - This paper presents a computational framework that combines supervised machine learning and multi-objective optimization to support data-driven decision-making for resource allocation in public healthcare systems. The study uses real-world data from 51 public hospitals across Southern and Northern Italy, ensuring a representative sample of diverse healthcare structures. It analyzes the interplay between hospital admission volumes, adherence to quality standards, operational efficiency, and energy costs. The framework integrates several predictive models-including Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Logistic Regression-developed in Python using the scikit-learn library. Model performance was optimized using calibration techniques, while interpretability was enhanced through SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), which identified the most influential clinical areas affecting both efficiency and energy expenditure. Feature importance results were used in a dual-objective linear optimization function to determine the optimal distribution of hospital admissions across nosological areas, balancing scale efficiency and energy cost reduction. Additionally, a multi-objective genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) was applied to optimize quality standard adherence levels, generating trade-off solutions along a Pareto frontier. The proposed approach offers a transparent, explainable, and scalable tool for healthcare administrators, providing actionable insights for strategic resource allocation. By integrating interpretable machine learning with computational optimization, the model contributes to building sustainable and high-performing hospital systems aligned with both operational and environmental objectives.

AB  - Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are essential tools in assessing treatment response, informing clinical decision making, driving healthcare policy, and providing important prognostic data regarding patient health status change. These tools become essential in orthopaedic disciplines, such as pediatrics and sports medicine, given the diversity of patient populations and procedures. However, the creation and routine administration of standard PROMs alone do not suffice to appropriately facilitate the aforementioned functions. Indeed, both the interpretation and optimal application of PROMs are essential to provide to achieve greatest clinical benefit. Contemporary developments and technologies surrounding PROMs may help augment this benefit, including the application of artificial intelligence, novel PROM structure with improved interpretability and validity, and PROM delivery methods that provide increased access to patients resulting in greater compliance and data acquisition yields. Despite these exciting innovations, several challenges remain in this realm that must be addressed to continue to advance the clinical usefulness and subsequent benefit of PROMs. This review will highlight the opportunities and challenges surrounding contemporary PROM use in the orthopaedic subspecialties of pediatrics and sports medicine.

AB  - The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare has the potential to revolutionize the global healthcare sector and medicine in general. However, integrating AI technologies in healthcare requires access to large amounts of personal health-related data (HRD), which raises concerns regarding confidential personal information considering unregulated and not transparent data ownership. Setting up the patient's welfare as an unquestionable principle, this commentary explores the various ethical aspects of using HRD in AI applications, focusing on informed consent, data ownership, data sharing, financial considerations, accountability, and ethical standards. Three models of potential collaboration between AI-specializing firms and healthcare providers are evaluated: the commercial model, the equitable profit-sharing model, and the public-funded non-profit model. Each model has its advantages and challenges, necessitating a careful balance between ethical considerations, financial implications, and technological advancements. Policymakers and healthcare regulators are urged to establish transparent legislation to safeguard patient privacy, ensure informed consent, and promote the responsible use of HRD in AI applications. This commentary emphasizes the importance of addressing ethical issues to protect basic patient rights, foster responsible collaborations, and ensure the ethical use of health-related data in AI-based healthcare applications. While the coexistence of regulated AI and healthcare professionals is inevitable for validating the cost-effectiveness of AI use in healthcare economics, the transparency of HRD sources is deemed of utmost importance in the best interest of the patient.

AB  - Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a new type of tomography that has experienced rapid development and potential in recent years. It is playing an increasingly important role in retinopathy diagnoses. At present, due to the uneven distributions of medical resources in various regions, the uneven proficiency levels of doctors in grassroots and remote areas, and the development needs of rare disease diagnosis and precision medicine, artificial intelligence technology based on deep learning can provide fast, accurate, and effective solutions for the recognition and diagnosis of retinal OCT images. To prevent vision damage and blindness caused by the delayed discovery of retinopathy, a fusion network (FN)-based retinal OCT classification algorithm (FN-OCT) is proposed in this paper to improve upon the adaptability and accuracy of traditional classification algorithms. The InceptionV3, Inception-ResNet, and Xception deep learning algorithms are used as base classifiers, a convolutional block attention mechanism (CBAM) is added after each base classifier, and three different fusion strategies are used to merge the prediction results of the base classifiers to output the final prediction results (choroidal neovascularization (CNV), diabetic macular oedema (DME), drusen, normal). The results show that in a classification problem involving the UCSD common retinal OCT dataset (108,312 OCT images from 4,686 patients), compared with that of the InceptionV3 network model, the prediction accuracy of FN-OCT is improved by 5.3% (accuracy = 98.7%, area under the curve (AUC) = 99.1%). The predictive accuracy and AUC achieved on an external dataset for the classification of retinal OCT diseases are 92 and 94.5%, respectively, and gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) is used as a visualization tool to verify the effectiveness of the proposed FNs. This finding indicates that the developed fusion algorithm can significantly improve the performance of classifiers while providing a powerful tool and theoretical support for assisting with the diagnosis of retinal OCT.

AB  - Facial emotion recognition has become increasingly important in healthcare, where understanding delicate cues like pain, discomfort, or unconsciousness can support more timely and responsive care. Yet, recognizing facial expressions in real-world settings remains challenging due to varying lighting, facial occlusions, and hardware limitations in clinical environments. To address this, we propose TriViT-Lite, a lightweight yet powerful model that blends three complementary components: MobileNet, for capturing fine-grained local features efficiently; Vision Transformers (ViT), for modeling global facial patterns; and handcrafted texture descriptors, such as Local Binary Patterns (LBP) and Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG), for added robustness. These multi-scale features are brought together through a texture-aware cross-attention fusion mechanism that helps the model focus on the most relevant facial regions dynamically. TriViT-Lite is evaluated on both benchmark datasets (FER2013, AffectNet) and a custom healthcare-oriented dataset covering seven critical emotional states, including pain and unconsciousness. It achieves a competitive accuracy of 91.8% on FER2013 and of 87.5% on the custom dataset while maintaining real-time performance (similar to 15 FPS) on resource-constrained edge devices. Our results show that TriViT-Lite offers a practical and accurate solution for real-time emotion recognition, particularly in healthcare settings. It strikes a balance between performance, interpretability, and efficiency, making it a strong candidate for machine-learning-driven pattern recognition in patient-monitoring applications.

AB  - Background In this work, we developed many machine learning classifiers to assist in diagnosing respiratory changes associated with sarcoidosis, based on results from the Forced Oscillation Technique (FOT), a non-invasive method used to assess pulmonary mechanics. In addition to accurate results, there is a particular interest in their interpretability and explainability, so we used Genetic Programming since the classification is made with intelligible expressions and we also evaluate the feature importance in different experiments to find the more discriminative features. Methodology/principal findings We used genetic programming in its traditional tree form and a grammar-based form. To check if interpretable results are competitive, we compared their performance to K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, AdaBoost, Random Forest, LightGBM, XGBoost, Decision Trees and Logistic Regressor. We also performed experiments with fuzzy features and tested a feature selection technique to bring even more interpretability. The data used to feed the classifiers come from the FOT exams in 72 individuals, of which 25 were healthy, and 47 were diagnosed with sarcoidosis. Among the latter, 24 showed normal conditions by spirometry, and 23 showed respiratory changes. The results achieved high accuracy (AUC > 0.90) in two analyses performed (controls vs. individuals with sarcoidosis and normal spirometry and controls vs. individuals with sarcoidosis and altered spirometry). Genetic Programming and Grammatical Evolution were particularly beneficial because they provide intelligible expressions to make the classification. The observation of which features were selected most frequently also brought explainability to the study of sarcoidosis. Conclusions The proposed system may provide decision support for clinicians when they are struggling to give a confirmed clinical diagnosis. Clinicians may reference the prediction results and make better decisions, improving the productivity of pulmonary function services by AI-assisted workflow.

AB  - Recently, machine learning has revolutionized medical diagnosis and prediction, rivaling human experts in accuracy. However, the limited interpretability poses challenges in meeting stringent medical decision standards. To facilitate interpretable predictive inference, this article proposes a small samples-oriented intrinsically explainable machine learning model, an Optimal Variational Bayesian Logistic Regression (OVBLR) model with a salient feature estimation strategy (OVBLR-SFE). OVBLR-SFE sequentially learns from limited labeled samples, mining disease-related risk factors to provide intrinsic interpretability to its predictive inference automatically. The model achieves this by reasonably approximating the posterior probability through the proposed OVBLR model to estimate the feature weight and influential effect on model outputs to facilitate salient feature selection. The effectiveness and superiority of OVBLR-SFE are demonstrated through extensive experiments on four benchmark medical datasets from the UCI repository, including the Bone Marrow Transplant: Children Data Set, Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original) Data Set, SPECT Heart Data Set, and Heart Disease Data Set, as well as a real-world case of intensive care unit readmission prediction. Experimental results reveal that the OVBLR-SFE can achieve high accuracies of 92.02%, 97.21%, 86.71%, and 84.47%, respectively, with an average classification accuracy of 90.10% stably on the four UCI datasets. Especially, OVBLR-SFE can accurately infer significant features that align with that obtained by the post-hoc interpretation approaches: SHAP and AcME, demonstrating remarkable interpretability. In the real application, the proposed method achieved a readmission prediction accuracy of 88.11% in predicting the readmission probabilities of liver transplantation patients. Notably, the inferred salient features, such as total Intensive Care Unit length of stay (ICUTime), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide(NTproBNP), Operating time of surgery(OperationTime_h), and intraoperative red blood cell transfusion (RBCT), emerges as crucial in readmission prediction, aligning with the assessments of clinical experts.

AB  - Anatomy educators are often at the forefront of adopting innovative and advanced technologies for teaching, such as artificial intelligence (AI). While AI offers potential new opportunities for anatomical education, hard lessons learned from the deployment of AI tools in other domains (e.g., criminal justice, healthcare, and finance) suggest that these opportunities are likely to be tempered by disadvantages for at least some learners and within certain educational contexts. From the perspectives of an anatomy educator, public health researcher, medical ethicist, and an educational technology expert, this article examines five tensions between the promises and the perils of integrating AI into anatomy education. These tensions highlight the ways in which AI is currently ill-suited for incorporating the uncertainties intrinsic to anatomy education in the areas of (1) human variations, (2) healthcare practice, (3) diversity and social justice, (4) student support, and (5) student learning. Practical recommendations for a considered approach to working alongside AI in the contemporary (and future) anatomy education learning environment are provided, including enhanced transparency about how AI is integrated, AI developer diversity, inclusion of uncertainty and anatomical variations within deployed AI, provisions made for educator awareness of AI benefits and limitations, building in curricular "AI-free" time, and engaging AI to extend human capacities. These recommendations serve as a guiding framework for how the clinical anatomy discipline, and anatomy educators, can work alongside AI, and develop a more nuanced and considered approach to the role of AI in healthcare education.

AB  - Various aspects of artificial intelligence (AI) have become of significant interest to academia and industry in recent times. To satisfy these academic and industrial interests, it is necessary to comprehensively investigate trends in AI-related changes of diverse areas. In this study, we identified and predicted emerging convergences with the help of AI-associated research abstracts collected from the SCOPUS database. The bidirectional encoder representations obtained via the transformers-based topic discovery technique were subsequently deployed to identify emerging topics related to AI. The topics discovered concern edge computing, biomedical algorithms, predictive defect maintenance, medical applications, fake news detection with block chain, explainable AI and COVID-19 applications. Their convergences were further analyzed based on the shortest path between topics to predict emerging convergences. Our findings indicated emerging AI convergences towards healthcare, manufacturing, legal applications, and marketing. These findings are expected to have policy implications for facilitating the convergences in diverse industries. Potentially, this study could contribute to the exploitation and adoption of AI-enabled convergences from a practical perspective.

AB  - Here the authors present a deep learning framework for dementia diagnosis, which can identify persons with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, and dementia due to other etiologies.
   Worldwide, there are nearly 10 million new cases of dementia annually, of which Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common. New measures are needed to improve the diagnosis of individuals with cognitive impairment due to various etiologies. Here, we report a deep learning framework that accomplishes multiple diagnostic steps in successive fashion to identify persons with normal cognition (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), AD, and non-AD dementias (nADD). We demonstrate a range of models capable of accepting flexible combinations of routinely collected clinical information, including demographics, medical history, neuropsychological testing, neuroimaging, and functional assessments. We then show that these frameworks compare favorably with the diagnostic accuracy of practicing neurologists and neuroradiologists. Lastly, we apply interpretability methods in computer vision to show that disease-specific patterns detected by our models track distinct patterns of degenerative changes throughout the brain and correspond closely with the presence of neuropathological lesions on autopsy. Our work demonstrates methodologies for validating computational predictions with established standards of medical diagnosis.

AB  - The widespread popularity of Machine Learning (ML) models in healthcare solutions has increased the demand for their interpretability and accountability. In this paper, we propose the Physiologically-Informed Gaussian Process (PhGP) classification model, an interpretable machine learning model founded on the Bayesian nature of Gaussian Processes (GPs). Specifically, we inject problem-specific domain knowledge of inherent physiological mechanisms underlying the psycho-physiological states as a prior distribution over the GP latent space. Thus, to estimate the hyper-parameters in PhGP, we rely on the information from raw physiological signals as well as the designed prior function encoding the physiologically-inspired modelling assumptions. Alongside this new model, we present novel interpretability metrics that highlight the most informative input regions that contribute to the GP prediction. We evaluate the ability of PhGP to provide an accurate and interpretable classification on three different datasets, including electrodermal activity (EDA) signals collected during emotional, painful, and stressful tasks. Our results demonstrate that, for all three tasks, recognition performance is improved by using the PhGP model compared to competitive methods. Moreover, PhGP is able to provide physiological sound interpretations over its predictions.

T2  - AI MAGAZINE
LA  - English

KW  - RISK
AB  - Machine learning decision support tools have become popular in a range of social domains including healthcare, criminal justice, and child welfare. But the design of these tools often fails to consider the potentially complex interactions that happen between the tools and humans. This lack of human-centered design is one reason that so few tools are actually deployed, and even if they are, struggle to achieve impact. In this article we present the example of the Allegheny Family Screening Tool, a machine learning model used since 2016 to support hotline screening of child maltreatment referrals. We describe aspects of human-centered design that contributed to the successful deployment of this tool, including agency leadership and ownership, transparency by design, ethical oversight, community engagement, and social license. Finally, we identify potential next-steps to encourage greater integration of human-centered design into the development and implementation of machine learning decision support tools.

AB  - The application of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology in the healthcare sector can significantly enhance the efficiency of China's healthcare services. However, risks persist in terms of accuracy, transparency, data privacy, ethics, and bias. These risks are manifested in three key areas: first, the potential erosion of human agency; second, issues of fairness and justice; and third, questions of liability and responsibility. This study reviews and analyzes the legal and regulatory frameworks established in China for the application of generative AI in healthcare, as well as relevant academic literature. Our research findings indicate that while China is actively constructing an ethical and legal governance framework in this field, the regulatory system remains inadequate and faces numerous challenges. These challenges include lagging regulatory rules; an unclear legal status of AI in laws such as the Civil Code; immature standards and regulatory schemes for medical AI training data; and the lack of a coordinated regulatory mechanism among different government departments. In response, this study attempts to establish a governance framework for generative AI in the medical field in China from both legal and ethical perspectives, yielding relevant research findings. Given the latest developments in generative AI in China, it is necessary to address the challenges of its application in the medical field from both ethical and legal perspectives. This includes enhancing algorithm transparency, standardizing medical data management, and promoting AI legislation. As AI technology continues to evolve, more diverse technical models will emerge in the future. This study also proposes that to address potential risks associated with medical AI, efforts should be made to establish a global AI ethics review committee to promote the formation of internationally unified ethical and legal review mechanisms.

AB  - ProblemSepsis, a life-threatening condition, accounts for the deaths of millions of people worldwide. Accurate prediction of sepsis outcomes is crucial for effective treatment and management. Previous studies have utilized machine learning for prognosis, but have limitations in feature sets and model interpretability.AimThis study aims to develop a machine learning model that enhances prediction accuracy for sepsis outcomes using a reduced set of features, thereby addressing the limitations of previous studies and enhancing model interpretability.MethodsThis study analyzes intensive care patient outcomes using the MIMIC-IV database, focusing on adult sepsis cases. Employing the latest data extraction tools, such as Google BigQuery, and following stringent selection criteria, we selected 38 features in this study. This selection is also informed by a comprehensive literature review and clinical expertise. Data preprocessing included handling missing values, regrouping categorical variables, and using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance the data. We evaluated several machine learning models: Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest. The Sequential Halving and Classification (SHAC) algorithm was used for hyperparameter tuning, and both train-test split and cross-validation methodologies were employed for performance and computational efficiency.ResultsThe Random Forest model was the most effective, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.94 with a confidence interval of +/- 0.01. This significantly outperformed other models and set a new benchmark in the literature. The model also provided detailed insights into the importance of various clinical features, with the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and average urine output being highly predictive. SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) analysis further enhanced the model's interpretability, offering a clearer understanding of feature impacts.ConclusionThis study demonstrates significant improvements in predicting sepsis outcomes using a Random Forest model, supported by advanced machine learning techniques and thorough data preprocessing. Our approach provided detailed insights into the key clinical features impacting sepsis mortality, making the model both highly accurate and interpretable. By enhancing the model's practical utility in clinical settings, we offer a valuable tool for healthcare professionals to make data-driven decisions, ultimately aiming to minimize sepsis-induced fatalities.

AB  - Early and accurate detection of Heart Disease (HD) is critical for improving patient outcomes, as HD remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Timely and precise prediction can aid in preventive interventions, reducing fatal risks associated with misdiagnosis. Machine learning (ML) models have gained significant attention in healthcare for their ability to assist professionals in diagnosing diseases with high accuracy. This study utilizes 918 instances from publicly available UCI and Kaggle datasets to develop and compare the performance of various ML models, including Adaptive Boosting (AB), Na & iuml;ve Bayes (NB), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Bagging, and Logistic Regression (LR). Before model training, data preprocessing techniques such as handling missing values, outlier detection using Isolation Forest, and feature scaling were applied to improve model performance. The evaluation was conducted using performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Among the tested models, XGB demonstrated the highest predictive performance, achieving an accuracy of 94.34% and an F1-score of 95.19%, surpassing other models and previous studies in HD prediction. LR closely followed with an accuracy of 93.08% and an F1-score of 93.99%, indicating competitive performance. In contrast, NB exhibited the lowest performance, with an accuracy of 88.05% and an F1-score of 89.02%, highlighting its limitations in handling complex patterns within the dataset. Although ML models show superior performance as compared to previous studies, some limitations exist, including the use of publicly available datasets, which may not fully capture real-world clinical variations, and the lack of feature selection techniques, which could impact model interpretability and robustness. Despite these limitations, the findings highlight the potential of ML-based frameworks for accurate and efficient HD detection, demonstrating their value as decision-support tools in clinical settings.

AB  - Background: Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) is a common complication following Type A aortic dissection (TAAD) surgery, significantly impacting prognosis and increasing mortality risk. This study developed and validated a predictive model based on machine learning (ML) algorithms to enable early and precise assessment of postoperative GIB risk in TAAD patients. Methods: Medical records of patients who underwent TAAD surgery at Shanxi Bethune Hospital from January 2019 to September 2024 were retrospectively collected. Predictors were screened using LASSO regression, and four ML algorithms-Random Forest (RF), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Decision Tree (DT)-were employed to construct models for predicting postoperative GIB risk. The dataset was divided into training and validation sets in a 7:3 ratio. Predictive performance was evaluated and compared using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and DeLong tests. Calibration curves and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to assess model calibration and clinical utility. The SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) algorithm was applied for interpretability analysis. This study adhered to the "Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis + Artificial Intelligence (TRIPOD+AI) guidelines." Results: A total of 525 TAAD patients were included, with 63 (12%) developing GIB. Nine predictors were selected via LASSO regression for model construction. The RF model outperformed the SVM, KNN, and DT models in predicting postoperative GIB, with areas under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.933, 0.892, 0.902, and 0.768, respectively, showing statistically significant differences (DeLong test, P < 0.05). Calibration curves and DCA further confirmed the RF model's excellent calibration and clinical utility. SHAP analysis identified the three most influential clinical features on the RF model's output: duration of mechanical ventilation (MV), Time to aortic occlusion, and red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. Conclusion: The machine learning-based predictive model effectively assesses postoperative GIB risk in TAAD patients, aiding healthcare providers in early identification of risk factors and implementation of targeted preventive strategies.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has markedly exacerbated the complexities surrounding the diagnosis and prognosis of diverse severe pneumonia types, posing extraordinary challenges to healthcare systems worldwide. While previous AI-based approaches primarily targeted COVID-19 severe pneumonia and sought to enhance machine learning accuracy, they often neglected critical aspects such as distinguishing diagnostic and prognostic features among COVID-19 infectious, non-COVID infectious, and non-infectious severe pneumonia, as well as the explainability and fairness of user-centric AI assist decisions. This study es the need for robust, fair, and reliable diagnosis and prognosis of severe pneumonia within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper introduces a user-centric framework that first employs a GaussianCopula-based data augmentation method to enhance fairness by addressing small imbalanced sample sets. Following this, the framework introduces an explainable AI system designed to classify three types of severe pneumonia using demographic and physiological indicators, offering transparent decision-making processes and an understandable analysis of prognosis risk factors. Our fair system utilizes transparent models exclusively, which enables healthcare practitioners to access intelligent and reliable medical services such as pre-diagnosis and prognosis analysis (the likelihood of death) of severe pneumonia. The results show the data augmentation method efficiently reduces data bias and enhances fairness, reaching 70.70% distribution similarity. Our transparent model based severe pneumonia classification module achieves 98.88% F1-scores on a real-world dataset. The transparent mechanism reveals that the four most significant features for classifying severe pneumonia types are 'Interleukin_6', 'Albumin', 'D_Dimer', and 'CD4_absolute_count'. Meanwhile, the explainable statistical analysis identifies critical mortality risk factors for each pneumonia category: 'Blood platelet' and 'Creatinine' for COVID-19 severe pneumonia, 'Hemameba', 'Interleukin-6', and 'Uric Acid' for non-COVID-19 infectious severe pneumonia, and 'Hemameba', 'BNP', 'Cholesterol', and 'PT' for non-infectious severe pneumonia. Our study highlights the potential of transparent machine learning algorithms for accurate diagnosis and Cox proportional regression for transparent risk trend prediction. These analytical tools and medical results can facilitate early and appropriate management of pneumonia patients for doctors, potentially revolutionizing diagnostic processes and patient care strategies to improve clinical outcomes.

AB  - Objective This study assesses the application of interpretable machine learning modeling using electronic medical record data for the prediction of conversion to neurological disease.Methods A retrospective dataset of Cleveland Clinic patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, or Parkinson's disease, and matched controls based on age, sex, race, and ethnicity was compiled. Individualized risk prediction models were created using eXtreme Gradient Boosting for each neurological disease at four timepoints in patient history. The prediction models were assessed for transparency and fairness.Results At timepoints 0-months, 12-months, 24-months, and 60-months prior to diagnosis, Alzheimer's disease models achieved the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve on a holdout test dataset of 0.794, 0.742, 0.709, and 0.645; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis of 0.883, 0.710, 0.658, and 0.620; multiple sclerosis of 0.922, 0.877, 0.849, and 0.781; and Parkinson's disease of 0.809, 0.738, 0.700, and 0.651, respectively.Conclusions The results demonstrate that electronic medical records contain latent information that can be used for risk stratification for neurological disorders. In particular, patient-reported outcomes, sleep assessments, falls data, additional disease diagnoses, and longitudinal changes in patient health, such as weight change, are important predictors.

AB  - A solid-state nanopore combined with the quantum transport method has garnered substantial attention and intrigue for DNA sequencing due to its potential for providing rapid and accurate sequencing results, which could have numerous applications in disease diagnosis and personalized medicine. However, the intricate and multifaceted nature of the experimental protocol poses a formidable challenge in attaining precise single nucleotide analysis. Here, we report a machine learning (ML) framework combined with the quantum transport method to accelerate high-throughput single nucleotide recognition with C3N nanopores. The optimized eXtreme Gradient Boosting Regression (XGBR) algorithm has predicted the fingerprint transmission of each unknown nucleotide and their rotation dynamics with root mean square error scores as low as 0.07. Interpretability of ML black box models with the game theory-based SHapley Additive exPlanation method has provided a quasi-explanation for the model working principle and the complex relationship between electrode-nucleotide coupling and transmission. Moreover, a comprehensive ML classification of nucleotides based on binary, ternary, and quaternary combinations shows maximum accuracy and F1 scores of 100%. The results suggest that ML in tandem with a nanopore device can potentially alleviate the experimental hurdles associated with quantum tunneling and facilitate fast and high-precision DNA sequencing.

AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a primary global health concern, and identifying the molecular pathways, genetic subtypes, and mutations associated with CRC is crucial for precision medicine. However, traditional measurement techniques such as gene sequencing are costly and time-consuming, while most deep learning methods proposed for this task lack interpretability. This study offers a new approach to enhance the stateof-the-art deep learning methods for molecular pathways and key mutation prediction by incorporating cell network information. We build cell graphs with nuclei as nodes and nuclei connections as edges of the network and leverage Social Network Analysis (SNA) measures to extract abstract, perceivable, and interpretable features that explicitly describe the cell network characteristics in an image. Our approach does not rely on precise nuclei segmentation or feature extraction, is computationally efficient, and is easily scalable. In this study, we utilize the TCGA-CRC-DX dataset, comprising 499 patients and 502 diagnostic slides from primary colorectal tumours, sourced from 36 distinct medical centres in the United States. By incorporating the SNA features alongside deep features in two multiple instance learning frameworks, we demonstrate improved performance for chromosomal instability (CIN), hypermutated tumour (HM), TP53 gene, BRAF gene, and Microsatellite instability (MSI) status prediction tasks (2.4%-4% and 7-8.8% improvement in AUROC and AUPRC on average). Additionally, our method achieves outstanding performance on MSI prediction in an external PAIP dataset (99% AUROC and 98% AUPRC), demonstrating its generalizability. Our findings highlight the discrimination power of SNA features and how they can be beneficial to deep learning models' performance and provide insights into the correlation of cell network profiles with molecular pathways and key mutations

AB  - There is a growing concern about typically opaque decision-making with high-performance machine learning algorithms. Providing an explanation of the reasoning process in domain-specific terms can be crucial for adoption in risk-sensitive domains such as healthcare. We argue that machine learning algorithms should be interpretable by design and that the language in which these interpretations are expressed should be domain- and task-dependent. Consequently, we base our model's prediction on a family of user-defined and task-specific binary functions of the data, each having a clear interpretation to the end-user. We then minimize the expected number of queries needed for accurate prediction on any given input. As the solution is generally intractable, following prior work, we choose the queries sequentially based on information gain. However, in contrast to previous work, we need not assume the queries are conditionally independent. Instead, we leverage a stochastic generative model (VAE) and an MCMC algorithm (Unadjusted Langevin) to select the most informative query about the input based on previous query-answers. This enables the online determination of a query chain of whatever depth is required to resolve prediction ambiguities. Finally, experiments on vision and NLP tasks demonstrate the efficacy of our approach and its superiority over post-hoc explanations.

AB  - Multimodal data integration has emerged as a transformative approach in the health care sector, systematically combining complementary biological and clinical data sources such as genomics, medical imaging, electronic health records, and wearable device outputs. This approach provides a multidimensional perspective of patient health that enhances the diagnosis, treatment, and management of various medical conditions. This viewpoint presents an overview of the current state of multimodal integration in health care, spanning clinical applications, current challenges, and future directions. We focus primarily on its applications across different disease domains, particularly in oncology and ophthalmology. Other diseases are briefly discussed due to the few available literature. In oncology, the integration of multimodal data enables more precise tumor characterization and personalized treatment plans. Multimodal fusion demonstrates accurate prediction of anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 therapy response (area under the curve=0.91). In ophthalmology, multimodal integration through the combination of genetic and imaging data facilitates the early diagnosis of retinal diseases. However, substantial challenges remain regarding data standardization, model deployment, and model interpretability. We also highlight the future directions of multimodal integration, including its expanded disease applications, such as neurological and otolaryngological diseases, and the trend toward large-scale multimodal models, which enhance accuracy. Overall, the innovative potential of multimodal integration is expected to further revolutionize the health care industry, providing more comprehensive and personalized solutions for disease management.

AB  - Purpose: Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a bacterial infection of ascitic fluid that develops naturally, without being triggered by any surgical conditions or procedures, and is a common complication of cirrhosis. With a potential mortality rate of 40 %, accurate diagnosis and prompt initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy are crucial for optimizing patient outcomes and preventing life-threatening complications. This study aimed to expand the use of computational models to improve the diagnostic accuracy of SBP in cirrhotic patients by incorporating a broader range of data, including clinical variables and laboratory values. Patients and methods: We employed 5 machine learning classification methods - Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Random Forest, utilizing a variety of demographic, clinical, and laboratory features and biomarkers. Results: Ascitic fluid markers, including white blood cell (WBC) count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), total protein, and polymorphonuclear cells (PMN), significantly differentiated between SBP and non-SBP patients. The Random Forest model demonstrated the highest overall accuracy at 86 %, while the Naive Bayes model achieved the highest sensitivity at 72 %. Utilizing 10 key features instead of the full feature set improved model performance, notably enhancing specificity and accuracy. Conclusion: Our analysis highlights the potential of machine learning to enhance the accuracy of SBP diagnosis in cirrhotic patients. Integrating these models into clinical workflows could substantially improve patient outcomes. To achieve this, ongoing multidisciplinary research is crucial. Ensuring model interpretability, continuous monitoring, and rigorous validation will be essential for the successful implementation of real-time clinical decision support systems.

AB  - Heart attacks are a leading cause of mortality worldwide, necessitating the development of accurate predictive models to enhance early detection and intervention strategies. This study addresses the significant problem of class imbalance in medical datasets, specifically focusing on heart attack prediction using the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset. To tackle this challenge, advanced machine learning (ML) methods are proposed to involve a refined dataset of 399,875 instances, with 47 significant features maintained through rigorous data cleaning and preparation. Balanced accuracy and macro-recall were chosen as primary metrics to ensure fair performance evaluation across classes in the imbalanced dataset. Our proposed system entails a detailed evaluation of various algorithms known for their effectiveness in managing class imbalance. The LGBM Classifier, XGB Classifier, and Logistic Regression (LR) are optimized using recursive feature elimination and hyperparameter tuning with Optuna. The results of this study are encapsulated in an ensemble model that significantly enhances predictive accuracy. The final model achieved 80.75% balanced accuracy and 79.97% recall for critical heart attack cases (class 1), along with an AUC score of 88.9%, indicating superior class distinction capability. Additionally, the application of SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis provided valuable insights into the contribution of each feature to heart attack likelihood, thus improving model transparency. This study's successful integration of complex ML techniques with interpretability analyses like SHAP marks a substantial advance in early detection and intervention strategies in healthcare. It demonstrates the potential of sophisticated ML approaches for early heart attack detection and prevention, highlighting their value in improving outcomes for patients with chronic diseases. These findings suggest promising pathways for employing advanced analytical tools in healthcare to enhance patient care.

AB  - In recent years, generative artificial intelligence (such as ChatGPT) has significantly transformed the scientific domain. This shift has raised concerns about how scientific journals should adapt to these new technologies and the ethical implications they pose for the scientific craft. This study addresses these concerns by examining how top-ranked journals across eight disciplines (communication, economics, education, ethics, healthcare, linguistics, sociology, and political science) are adapting their author guidelines in response to the use of artificial intelligence in research. The content analysis reveals that 73.8% of journals mention the use of AI for drafting sections of articles, while references to its use in literature reviews are notably absent. Additionally, 61.3% of the journals mandate transparency regarding AI usage in research, but only 12% address privacy and data protection issues. There are notable differences across disciplines in their acceptance and regulation of AI: communication and sociology show greater openness to AI use, while economics remains more conservative. These findings suggest a growing acceptance of AI in certain stages of the research process, while also highlighting significant caution in its application to critical areas such as literature reviews.

AB  - Accurate cancer prognosis is essential for personalized clinical management, guiding treatment strategies and predicting patient survival. Conventional methods, which depend on the subjective evaluation of histopathological features, exhibit significant inter-observer variability and limited predictive power. To overcome these limitations, we developed cross-attention transformer-based multimodal fusion network (CATfusion), a deep learning framework that integrates multimodal histology-genomic data for comprehensive cancer survival prediction. By employing self-supervised learning strategy with TabAE for feature extraction and utilizing cross-attention mechanisms to fuse diverse data types, including mRNA-seq, miRNA-seq, copy number variation, DNA methylation variation, mutation data, and histopathological images. By successfully integrating this multi-tiered patient information, CATfusion has become an advanced survival prediction model to utilize the most diverse data types across various cancer types. CATfusion's architecture, which includes a bidirectional multimodal attention mechanism and self-attention block, is adept at synchronizing the learning and integration of representations from various modalities. CATfusion achieves superior predictive performance over traditional and unimodal models, as demonstrated by enhanced C-index and survival area under the curve scores. The model's high accuracy in stratifying patients into distinct risk groups is a boon for personalized medicine, enabling tailored treatment plans. Moreover, CATfusion's interpretability, enabled by attention-based visualization, offers insights into the biological underpinnings of cancer prognosis, underscoring its potential as a transformative tool in oncology.

AB  - Univariate time series forecasting is pivotal in domains such as climate modeling, finance, and healthcare, where both short-term precision and long-term reliability are essential. This study introduces AUNET (Attention-based Unified Network)-a novel extension of the N-BEATS model-integrating multi-head self-attention to capture both short-term fluctuations and long-term dependencies while reducing architectural redundancy and enhancing interpretability. Empirical evaluations on the (baseline dataset for this research) CIMIS weather dataset show that AUNET achieves a 0.3580 MAE, 0.4632 RMSE, 0.68% MAPE, and an R-2 of 0.9988, outperforming baseline models including N-BEATS and attention-augmented variants by margins exceeding 87% in MAE and RMSE. AUNET's generalization capabilities are further validated on diverse domains: in finance it attains an R-2 of 0.9990, and in healthcare, it outperforms baselines in RMSE and R-2 despite inherent volatility. Statistical assessments confirm the significance and robustness of these improvements. Moreover, AUNET demonstrates reduced training time, lower FLOPs, and higher convergence stability. Its attention-guided modular architecture not only enhances predictive accuracy but also promotes transparency, making AUNET a compelling candidate for deployment in high-stakes, real-world forecasting tasks across varied domains.

AB  - Smart healthcare applications cannot be separated from healthcare data analysis and the interactive interpretability between data and model. A human-in-the-loop active learning approach is introduced to reduce the cost of healthcare data labelling by evaluating the information quality of unlabelled medical data and then screening the high informative samples. Specifically, focused on the extracted feature tensor of medical images, a new evaluation metric was proposed, called local feature information distance. Then, the whole feature information distance between two images can be obtained by seeking optimal matching of local feature information correlation based on the feature spatial traversal. Further, the feature information distance entropy (FIDE) method was proposed from the perspective of feature spatial distribution, which outperformed other related works. Many comparison and ablation experiments were carried out; the results showed that the proposed method can well distinguish the information quality of the unlabelled samples even facing different datasets. The stability, robustness, and generalisation of the proposed method were verified. Thus, this study provides some inspirations for healthcare data analysis and efficient management, such as eliminating redundancy and selective annotation.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare operations. Nevertheless, particularly in the context of preventive care, little is known about how laypeople perceive and accept AI and change their behavior accordingly. Grounded in a solid theoretical framework of trust, this study bridges this gap by exploring individuals' acceptance of AI-based preventive health interventions and following health behavior change, which is critical for preventive care providers' operational and business performance. Through a randomized field experiment with 15,000 users of a mobile health app complemented by a survey, we first show that the use and disclosure of AI in preventive health interventions improve their effectiveness. However, individuals are less likely to accept and achieve the health behavior change suggested by AI than when they receive similar interventions from health experts. We also observe that the effectiveness of AI-based interventions can be improved by combining them with human expert opinions, increasing their algorithmic transparency, or emphasizing their genuine care and warmth. These results collectively suggest that, different from conventional technologies, AI's deficient affective trust, rather than comparable cognitive trust, play a decisive role in the acceptance of AI-based preventive health interventions. This study sheds light on the literature on the role of new-age information technologies in behavioral operations management, consumer marketing, and healthcare as well as the role of trust in technology acceptance. Valuable practical implications for more effective management of AI for preventive care operations and promotion of consumers' health behavior are also provided.

AB  - Heart disease is a widespread health problem that poses a significant global challenge. It includes a variety of heart-related conditions such as heart failure, coronary artery disease, and ventricular fibrillation all of which contribute to a significant global morbidity and mortality burden. Poor diet, physical inactivity, smoking, and underlying health conditions such as hypertension and diabetes. To mitigate the impact of this multifaceted problem, comprehensive preventive strategies, early detection through regular medical check-ups, and effective management are required. To promote heart-healthy habits and reduce the prevalence of this widespread health concern, not only individual awareness and behavioral changes are required, but also systemic efforts in healthcare policy, education, and accessible medical services. This study presents a novel coronary artery disease Forecast Model that seamlessly combines the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in response to the growing global burden of cardiovascular the approach uses advanced techniques, specifically TabNet in conjunction with catBoost, to improve the accuracy and efficiency of heart disease prediction. The IoMT is an important component because it enables seamless gathering of information from a wide range of healthcare devices, like wearables as well as sensors. diseases (CVDs). The approach uses advanced techniques, specifically TabNet in conjunction with catBoost, to improve the accuracy and efficiency of heart disease prediction. The IoMT is an important component because it enables seamless gathering of information from a wide range of healthcare devices, like wearable's as well as sensors. Proposed model employs Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) to collect a wide range of physiological data from connected medical devices, such as continuous heart rate monitoring, electrocardiograms (ECG), and blood pressure readings. TabNet and catBoost Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms are critical in processing and interpreting the complex data obtained through IoMT. TabNet, which is well-known for its ability to efficiently handle tabular data, is used for feature selection and extraction. CatBoost, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm, on the other hand, contributes to the model's predictive accuracy by handling categorical features and mitigating overfitting. The combination of these cutting-edge techniques improves precision as well as interpretability, allowing for a more detailed understanding of the factors influencing predictive outcomes. A large dataset with a variety of patient profiles, risk factors, and medical histories is used in the model's training regimen. By fine-tuning this diverse dataset, the model's adaptability to different demographic and clinical scenarios is improved, paving the way for personalized heart disease risk assessments. Furthermore, the proposed model supports immediate processing, allowing for rapid predictions based on streaming IoMT data. Finally, Heart Disease Prediction Model represents a paradigm shift in predictive healthcare by combining the strengths of IoMT and advanced computer vision techniques. The research envisions the implementation of this integrated model as a transformative tool in healthcare. By combining the real-time data acquisition capabilities of IoMT with the predictive prowess of TabNet and catBoost, the model aims to provide timely and accurate predictions of heart disease risks.
   This innovative approach holds great promise for ushering in a new era of personalized and effective preventive care strategies, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes in cardiovascular health.

AB  - This study contributes to the Health 4.0 paradigm by enhancing the precision of cell nuclei detection in histopathological images, a critical step in digital pathology. The presented approach is characterized by the combination of deep learning with traditional analytic classifiers. Traditional methods in histopathology rely heavily on manual inspection by expert histopathologists. While deep learning has revolutionized this process by offering rapid and accurate detections, its black-box nature often results in a lack of interpretability. This can be a significant hindrance in clinical settings where understanding the rationale behind predictions is crucial for decision-making and quality assurance. Our research addresses this gap by employing the YOLOv5 framework for initial nuclei detection, followed by an analysis phase where poorly performing cases are isolated and retrained to enhance model robustness. Furthermore, we introduce a logistic regression classifier that uses a combination of color and textural features to discriminate between satisfactorily and unsatisfactorily analyzed images. This dual approach not only improves detection accuracy but also provides insights into model performance variations, fostering a layer of interpretability absent in most deep learning applications. By integrating these advanced analytical techniques, our work aligns with the Health 4.0 initiative's goals of leveraging digital innovations to elevate healthcare quality. This study paves the way for more transparent, efficient, and reliable digital pathology practices, underscoring the potential of smart technologies in enhancing diagnostic processes within the Health 4.0 framework.

AB  - Background: Healthcare data volume is increasingly expanding, presenting both challenges and opportunities. Traditional statistical methods applied in epidemiology, such as logistic regression (LR), albeit widely used, holds limited ability to handle the complexity and high dimensionality of modern datasets. In contrast, machine learning (ML) methods can model complex, non-linear relationships and are less constrained by parametric assumptions, ideal for uncovering hidden patterns. Methods: In this study, we aim to introduce ML applications for epidemiologic research and explore three predictive models: LR as a traditional modeling approach, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) as ML approaches. We demonstrate how ML approaches, particularly XGBoost, can benefit epidemiologic research through a real-world case study. We present common steps: data preprocessing, model creation and evaluation processes. Additionally, we address the "black box" nature of ML models and present post hoc explanation tools to enhance interpretability. Results: We examined the case of near-centenarianism (reaching age of 95 years or older) prediction using midlife predictors (i.e., demographic, clinical, lifestyle, occupational and dietary variables) in a cohort of approximately 10,000 middle-aged working men recruited in 1963 and followed until death or until 2019. Models were fitted and calibrated on a training set, showing good predictive performances on a separate test set. XGboost, LASSO regression, and LR achieved ROC-AUC values of 0.72 (95 % CI: 0.66-0.75), 0.71 (95 % CI: 0.67-0.74) and 0.69 (95 % CI: 0.66-0.73), respectively. Explainability analysis identified key predictors for longevity, including systolic blood pressure, smoking status, and a history of myocardial infarction; consistent with prior studies. Conclusions: In conclusion, our findings highlight the potential of ML to enhance epidemiological studies by handling complex interactions and high-dimensional data, suggesting a complementary approach to traditional methods.

AB  - There is mounting global interest in the revolutionary potential of AI tools. However, its use in healthcare carries certain risks. Some argue that opaque ('black box') AI systems in particular undermine patients' informed consent. While interpretable models offer an alternative, this approach may be impossible with generative AI and large language models (LLMs). Thus, we propose that AI tools should be evaluated for clinical use based on their implementation risk, rather than interpretability. We introduce a practical decision algorithm for the clinical implementation of black-box AI by evaluating its risk of implementation. Applied to the case of an LLM for surgical informed consent, we assess a system's implementation risk by evaluating: (1) technical robustness, (2) implementation feasibility and (3) analysis of harms and benefits. Accordingly, the system is categorised as minimal-risk (standard use), moderate-risk (innovative use) or high-risk (experimental use). Recommendations for implementation are proportional to risk, requiring more oversight for higher-risk categories. The algorithm also considers the system's cost-effectiveness and patients' informed consent.

AB  - Introduction: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) and peripheral artery disease (PAD) are two vascular diseases with a significant risk of major adverse cardiovascular events and mortality. A challenge in current disease management is the unpredictable disease progression in individual patients. The VASCUL-AID-RETRO study aims to develop trustworthy multimodal predictive artificial intelligence (AI) models for multiple tasks including risk stratification of disease progression and cardiovascular events in patients with AAA and PAD.Methods: The VASCUL-AID-RETRO study will collect data from 5000 AAA and 6000 PAD patients across multiple European centers of the VASCUL-AID consortium using electronic health records from 2015 to 2024. This retrospectively-collected data will be enriched with additional data from existing biobanks and registries. Multimodal data, including clinical records, radiological imaging, proteomics, and genomics, will be collected to develop AI models predicting disease progression and cardiovascular risks. This will be done while integrating the international ethics guidelines and legal standards for trustworthy AI, to ensure a socially-responsible data integration and analysis.Proposed Analyses: A consensus-based variable list of clinical parameters and core outcome set for both diseases will be developed through meetings with key opinion leaders. Blood, plasma, and tissue samples from existing biobanks will be analyzed for proteomic and genomic variations. AI models will be trained on segmented AAA and PAD artery geometries for estimation of hemodynamic parameters to quantify disease progression. Initially, risk prediction models will be developed for each modality separately, and subsequently, all data will be combined to be used as input to multimodal prediction models. During all processes, data security, data quality, and ethical guidelines and legal standards will be carefully considered. As a next step, the developed models will be further adjusted with prospective data and internally validated in a prospective cohort (VASCUL-AID-PRO study).Conclusion: The VASCUL-AID-RETRO study will utilize advanced AI techniques and integrate clinical, imaging, and multi-omics data to predict AAA and PAD progression and cardiovascular events.Clinical Trial Registration: The VASCUL-AID-RETRO study is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov under the identification number NCT06206369.Clinical Impact The VASCUL-AID-RETRO study aims to improve clinical practice of vascular surgery by developing artificial intelligence-driven multimodal predictive models for patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms or peripheral artery disease, enhancing personalized medicine. By integrating comprehensive data sets including clinical, imaging, and multi-omics data, these models have the potential to provide accurate risk stratification for disease progression and cardiovascular events. An innovation lies in the extensive European data set in combination with multimodal analyses approaches, which enables the development of advanced models to facilitate better understanding of disease mechanisms and progression. For clinicians, this means that more precise, individualized treatment plans can be established, ultimately aiming to improve patient outcomes.

AB  - Given the limited capacity to accurately determine the necessity for intubation in intensive care unit settings, this study aimed to develop and externally validate an interpretable machine learning model capable of predicting the need for intubation among ICU patients. Seven widely used machine learning (ML) algorithms were employed to construct the prediction models. Adult patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database who stayed in the ICU for longer than 24 h were included in the development and internal validation. The model was subsequently externally validated using the eICU-CRD database. In addition, the SHapley Additive exPlanations method was employed to interpret the influence of individual parameters on the predictions made by the model. A total of 11,988 patients were included in the final cohort for this study. The CatBoost model demonstrated the best performance (AUC: 0.881). In the external validation set, the efficacy of our model was also confirmed (AUC: 0.750), which suggests robust generalization capabilities. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), body mass index (BMI), arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), respiratory rate (RR) and length of stay (LOS) before ICU were the top 5 features of the CatBoost model with the greatest impact. We developed an externally validated CatBoost model that accurately predicts the need for intubation in ICU patients within 24 to 96 h of admission, facilitating clinical decision-making and has the potential to improve patient outcomes. The prediction model utilizes readily obtainable monitoring parameters and integrates the SHAP method to enhance interpretability, providing clinicians with clear insights into the factors influencing predictions.

TI  - Deep representation learning identifies associations between physical activity and sleep patterns during pregnancy and prematurity
T2  - NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE
LA  - English
AB  - Preterm birth (PTB) is the leading cause of infant mortality globally. Research has focused on developing predictive models for PTB without prioritizing cost-effective interventions. Physical activity and sleep present unique opportunities for interventions in low- and middle-income populations (LMICs). However, objective measurement of physical activity and sleep remains challenging and self-reported metrics suffer from low-resolution and accuracy. In this study, we use physical activity data collected using a wearable device comprising over 181,944 h of data across N = 1083 patients. Using a new state-of-the art deep learning time-series classification architecture, we develop a 'clock' of healthy dynamics during pregnancy by using gestational age (GA) as a surrogate for progression of pregnancy. We also develop novel interpretability algorithms that integrate unsupervised clustering, model error analysis, feature attribution, and automated actigraphy analysis, allowing for model interpretation with respect to sleep, activity, and clinical variables. Our model performs significantly better than 7 other machine learning and AI methods for modeling the progression of pregnancy. We found that deviations from a normal 'clock' of physical activity and sleep changes during pregnancy are strongly associated with pregnancy outcomes. When our model underestimates GA, there are 0.52 fewer preterm births than expected (P = 1.01e - 67, permutation test) and when our model overestimates GA, there are 1.44 times (P = 2.82e - 39, permutation test) more preterm births than expected. Model error is negatively correlated with interdaily stability (P = 0.043, Spearman's), indicating that our model assigns a more advanced GA when an individual's daily rhythms are less precise. Supporting this, our model attributes higher importance to sleep periods in predicting higher-than-actual GA, relative to lower-than-actual GA (P = 1.01e - 21, Mann-Whitney U). Combining prediction and interpretability allows us to signal when activity behaviors alter the likelihood of preterm birth and advocates for the development of clinical decision support through passive monitoring and exercise habit and sleep recommendations, which can be easily implemented in LMICs.

T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING
LA  - English
AB  - Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into data-driven decision-making offers advantages like increased performance, reduced costs and improved organisational efficiency; however, there are associated risks. The study employs a PRISMA protocol to systematically review academic articles from Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science databases to determine whether the risks AI pose are worth the rewards they offer. Literature trends reveal a growing interest in AI-driven decision-making, with significant research gaps in African contexts. The study indicates that AI is highly utilized for decision-making to foster competitiveness in manufacturing, finance, healthcare, education, and transport. Identified risks include bias, discrimination, privacy issues, and cybersecurity threats. It is highlighted that businesses need to address concerns about privacy, fairness, and transparency. Policymakers must develop ethical and legal standards besides regular monitoring and auditing of AI uses to mitigate risks.

AB  - Clinical limitations due to poverty significantly impact the lives and health of many individuals globally. Nevertheless, this challenge can be addressed with modern technologies, particularly through robotics and artificial intelligence. This study aims to address these challenges using advanced technologies in robotic surgery and artificial intelligence, proposing a method to fully automate endometriosis robotic surgery with a focus on interpretability, accuracy, and reliability. A methodology for fully automatic endometriosis surgery is introduced. Given the complexity of endometriosis lesions detection, they are categorized by their anatomical location to improve system interpretability. Then, three ensemble U-Net frameworks are designed to detect and localize common types of endometriosis lesions intraoperatively. A cross-training approach is employed, exploring U-Net models with diverse neural architectures-such as ResNet50, ResNet101, VGG19, InceptionV3, MobileNet, and EfficientNetB7-to develop U-Net ensemble models for precise endometriosis lesions segmentation. A novel image augmentation technique is also introduced, enhancing the segmentation models' accuracy and reliability. Furthermore, two U-Net models are developed to localize the ovaries and uterus, mitigating unexpected noise and bolstering the method's accuracy and reliability. The image segmentation models, assessed using the Intersection over Union (IoU) metric, achieved outstanding results: 97.57% for ovarian, 96.35% for uterine, and 92.58% for peritoneal endometriosis. This study proposes a fully automatic method for some common types of endometriosis surgery, including ovarian endometriomas and superficial endometriosis. This method is centered around three ensemble U-Net frameworks and a noise reduction technique using two additional U-Nets for localizing the ovaries and uterus. This approach has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of robotic surgeries, potentially reducing healthcare costs and improving outcomes for patients worldwide.

AB  - Dysarthria, a motor speech disorder commonly associated with neurological conditions such as cerebral palsy and ALS, poses significant challenges for early diagnosis and intervention. Traditional diagnostic methods often rely on subjective assessments, leading to delays in effective treatment. Recent advances in machine learning and deep learning offer promising avenues for automated dysarthria detection, enabling faster and more reliable assessments. However, these approaches often face challenges in handling diverse languages and operating efficiently on resource-constrained devices. In this study, we leverage the TORGO database with cerebral palsy, ALS, or control subjects, along with a Russian-voice dataset, to explore automated dysarthria classification. We evaluate the performance of machine learning models, including Random Forest Classifier and XGBClassifier, in comparison with state-of-the-art deep learning architectures such as CNN-LSTM. Building upon these findings, we suggest an enhanced WaveNet-based model specifically optimized to capture the temporal characteristics of audio signals across large and diverse datasets. To address real-world challenges, we introduce a Real-Time Adaptation Framework, enabling efficient and accurate dysarthria detection even on resource-constrained devices. Additionally, explainability enhancements using SHAP values and Grad-CAM techniques are integrated, providing insights into the model's decision-making process and improving its reliability for clinical applications. The suggested WaveNet-based model demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving precision, recall, and Fscore values of 0.92040, 0.91979, and 0.91965, respectively, alongside a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.89320, outperforming other models. These results highlight the potential of our approach for rapid and reliable dysarthria detection, particularly in multilingual and resource-limited settings. By combining explainability and real-time capabilities, our solution is well-positioned to support healthcare professionals in timely and accurate diagnosis, ultimately enhancing patient care and outcomes.

While research has mainly explored the usability and limitations of state-of-the-art machine translation tools in the detection and diagnosis of physical diseases and conditions, there is a persistent lack of evidence-based studies on the applicability of machine translation tools in the delivery of mental healthcare services for vulnerable populations. Our study developed Bayesian machine learning algorithms using relevance vector machine to support frontline health workers and medical professionals to make better informed decisions between risks and convenience of using online translation tools when delivering mental healthcare services to Spanish-speaking minority populations living in English-speaking countries. Major strengths of the machine learning classifier that we developed include scalability, interpretability, and adaptability of the classifier for diverse mental healthcare settings. In this paper, we report on the process of the Bayesian machine learning classifier development through automatic feature optimisation and the interpretation of the classifier-enabled assessment of the suitability of original English mental health information for automatic online translation. We elaborate on the interpretation of the assessment results in clinical settings using statistical tools such as positive likelihood ratios and negative likelihood ratios.

AB  - The integration of artificial intelligence in medical image classification has significantly advanced disease detection. However, traditional deep learning models face persistent challenges, including poor generalizability, high false-positive rates, and difficulties in distinguishing overlapping anatomical features, limiting their clinical utility. To address these limitations, this study proposes a hybrid framework combining Vision Transformers (ViT) and Perceiver IO, designed to enhance multi-disease classification accuracy. Vision Transformers leverage self-attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies in medical images, while Perceiver IO optimizes feature extraction for computational efficiency and precision. The framework is evaluated across three critical clinical domains: neurological disorders, including Stroke (tested on the Brain Stroke Prediction CT Scan Image Dataset) and Alzheimer's (analyzed via the Best Alzheimer MRI Dataset); skin diseases, covering Tinea (trained on the Skin Diseases Dataset) and Melanoma (augmented with dermoscopic images from the HAM10000/HAM10k dataset); and lung diseases, focusing on Lung Cancer (using the Lung Cancer Image Dataset) and Pneumonia (evaluated with the Pneumonia Dataset containing bacterial, viral, and normal X-ray cases). For neurological disorders, the model achieved 0.99 accuracy, 0.99 precision, 1.00 recall, 0.99 F1-score, demonstrating robust detection of structural brain abnormalities. In skin disease classification, it attained 0.95 accuracy, 0.93 precision, 0.97 recall, 0.95 F1-score, highlighting its ability to differentiate fine-grained textural patterns in lesions. For lung diseases, the framework achieved 0.98 accuracy, 0.97 precision, 1.00 recall, 0.98 F1score, confirming its efficacy in identifying respiratory conditions. To bridge research and clinical practice, an AIpowered chatbot was developed for real-time analysis, enabling users to upload MRI, X-ray, or skin images for automated diagnosis with confidence scores and interpretable insights. This work represents the first application of ViT and Perceiver IO for these disease categories, outperforming conventional architectures in accuracy, computational efficiency, and clinical interpretability. The framework holds significant potential for early disease detection in healthcare settings, reducing diagnostic errors, and improving treatment outcomes for clinicians, radiologists, and patients. By addressing critical limitations of traditional models, such as overlapping feature confusion and false positives, this research advances the deployment of reliable AI tools in neurology, dermatology, and pulmonology.

KW  - DIAGNOSIS
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses significant challenges to healthcare systems across the globe. Early and accurate AD diagnosis is crucial for effective management and treatment. Recent advances in neuroimaging and genomics provide an opportunity for developing multi-modality-based AD diagnosis models using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. However, the data complexities cause challenges in developing interpretable AI-based AD identification models. In this study, the author built a comprehensive AD diagnostic model using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and gene expression data. MobileNet V3 and EfficientNet B7 model was employed to extract AD features from gene expression data. The author introduced a hybrid TWIN-Performer-based feature extraction model to derive features from MRI. The attention-based feature fusion was used to fuse the crucial features. An ensemble learning-based classification model integrating CatBoost, XGBoost, and extremely randomized tree (ERT) was developed to identify cognitively normal (CN) and AD features. The proposed model was validated on diverse datasets. It achieved a superior performance on MRI and gene expression datasets. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) scores were consistently above 0.85, indicating excellent model performance. The use of Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values improved the model's interpretability, leading to earlier interventions and personalized treatment strategies.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Multidrug Resistance has been identified by the World Health Organization a major global health threat. It leads to severe social and economic consequences, including extended hospital stays, increased healthcare costs, and higher mortality rates. In response to this challenge, this study proposes a novel interpretable Machine Learning (ML) approach for predicting MDR, developed with two primary objectives: accurate inference and enhanced explainability. Methods: For inference, the proposed method is based on patient-to-patient similarity representations to predict MDR outcomes. Each patient is modeled as a Multivariate Time Series (MTS), capturing both clinical progression and interactions with similar patients. To quantify these relationships, we employ MTS-based similarity metrics, including feature engineering using descriptive statistics, Dynamic Time Warping, and the Time Cluster Kernel. These methods are used as inputs for MDR classification through Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, with dimensionality reduction and kernel transformations applied to enhance model performance. For explainability, we employ graph-based methods to extract meaningful patterns from the data. Patient similarity networks are generated using the MTS-based similarity metrics mentioned above, while spectral clustering and t-SNE are applied to identify MDR-related subgroups, uncover clinically relevant patterns, and visualize high-risk clusters. These insights improve interpretability and support more informed decision-making in critical care settings. Results: We validate our architecture on real-world Electronic Health Records from the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) dataset at the University Hospital of Fuenlabrada, achieving a Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve of 81%. Our framework surpasses ML and deep learning models on the same dataset leveraging graph-based patient similarity. In addition, it offers a simple yet effective interpretability mechanism that facilitates the identification of key risk factors-such as prolonged antibiotic exposure, invasive procedures, co-infections, and extended ICU stays-and the discovery of clinically meaningful patient clusters. For transparency, all results and code are available at https://github.com/oscarescuderoarnanz/DM4MTS. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the effectiveness of patient similarity representations and graph-based methods for MDR prediction and interpretability. The approach enhances prediction, identifies key risk factors, and improves patient stratification, enabling early detection and targeted interventions, highlighting the potential of interpretable ML in critical care.

KW  - SELECTION
AB  - Machine learning methods can detect complex relationships between variables, but usually do not exploit domain knowledge. This is a limitation because in many scientific disciplines, such as systems biology, domain knowledge is available in the form of graphs or networks, and its use can improve model performance. We need network-based algorithms that are versatile and applicable in many research areas. In this work, we demonstrate subnetwork detection based on multi-modal node features using a novel Greedy Decision Forest (GDF) with inherent interpretability. The latter will be a crucial factor to retain experts and gain their trust in such algorithms. To demonstrate a concrete application example, we focus on bioinformatics, systems biology and particularly biomedicine, but the presented methodology is applicable in many other domains as well. Systems biology is a good example of a field in which statistical data-driven machine learning enables the analysis of large amounts of multi-modal biomedical data. This is important to reach the future goal of precision medicine, where the complexity of patients is modeled on a system level to best tailor medical decisions, health practices and therapies to the individual patient. Our proposed explainable approach can help to uncover disease-causing network modules from multi-omics data to better understand complex diseases such as cancer.

AB  - Because machine learning has been widely used in various domains, interpreting internal mechanisms and predictive results of models is crucial for further applications of complex machine learning models. However, the interpretability of complex machine learning models on biased data remains a difficult problem. When the important explanatory features of concerned data are highly influenced by contaminated distributions, particularly in risk-sensitive fields, such as self-driving vehicles and healthcare, it is crucial to provide a robust interpretation of complex models for users. The interpretation of complex models is often associated with analyzing model features by measuring feature importance. Therefore, this article proposes a novel method derived from high-dimensional model representation (HDMR) to measure feature importance. The proposed method can provide robust estimation when the input features follow contaminated distributions. Moreover, the method is model-agnostic, which can enhance its ability to compare different interpretations due to its generalizability. Experimental evaluations on artificial models and machine learning models show that the proposed method is more robust than the traditional method based on HDMR.

AB  - IntroductionUrinary incontinence (UI) is a common side effect of prostate cancer treatment, but in clinical practice, it is difficult to predict. Machine learning (ML) models have shown promising results in predicting outcomes, yet the lack of transparency in complex models known as "black-box" has made clinicians wary of relying on them in sensitive decisions. Therefore, finding a balance between accuracy and explainability is crucial for the implementation of ML models. The aim of this study was to employ three different ML classifiers to predict the probability of experiencing UI in men with localized prostate cancer 1-year and 2-year after treatment and compare their accuracy and explainability. MethodsWe used the ProZIB dataset from the Netherlands Comprehensive Cancer Organization (Integraal Kankercentrum Nederland; IKNL) which contained clinical, demographic, and PROM data of 964 patients from 65 Dutch hospitals. Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms were applied to predict (in)continence after prostate cancer treatment. ResultsAll models have been externally validated according to the TRIPOD Type 3 guidelines and their performance was assessed by accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC. While all three models demonstrated similar performance, LR showed slightly better accuracy than RF and SVM in predicting the risk of UI one year after prostate cancer treatment, achieving an accuracy of 0.75, a sensitivity of 0.82, and an AUC of 0.79. All models for the 2-year outcome performed poorly in the validation set, with an accuracy of 0.6 for LR, 0.65 for RF, and 0.54 for SVM. ConclusionThe outcomes of our study demonstrate the promise of using non-black box models, such as LR, to assist clinicians in recognizing high-risk patients and making informed treatment choices. The coefficients of the LR model show the importance of each feature in predicting results, and the generated nomogram provides an accessible illustration of how each feature impacts the predicted outcome. Additionally, the model's simplicity and interpretability make it a more appropriate option in scenarios where comprehending the model's predictions is essential.

AB  - This research aims to design and validate a machine learning model to predict the probability of urinary tract infections within 90 days post-urostomy in bladder cancer patients. Clinical and follow-up information from 317 patients who had urostomy procedures at the First Affiliated Hospital of Shanxi Medical University (May 2018-May 2024) were analyzed. The dataset were partitioned into training and testing sets, and feature selection was executed via the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator regression technique. Seven machine learning algorithms were employed: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, LightGBM, Random Forest, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine, and Multi-Layer Perceptron. Performance metrics for the model were assessed using multiple evaluation indicators, including AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, Positive Predictive Value, Negative Predictive Value, and F1 score. SHapley Additive exPlanations and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations algorithms were applied for model interpretability. UTIs occurred in 22.08% of patients within 90 days after urostomy. The predictive model pinpointed eight important clinical features. Among the developed models, the SVM model demonstrated the best overall performance with AUC (0.835), accuracy (0.825), precision (0.583), recall (0.778), and F1 score (0.667). This model, designed to assess UTIs risk after urostomy in bladder cancer patients, has been deployed online for healthcare professionals at: https://zqmodel.shinyapps.io/shinydashboard_model/.

AB  - Machine learning decision support tools have become popular in a range of social domains including healthcare, criminal justice, and child welfare. But the design of these tools often fails to consider the potentially complex interactions that happen between the tools and humans. This lack of human-centered design is one reason that so few tools are actually deployed, and even if they are, struggle to achieve impact. In this article we present the example of the Allegheny Family Screening Tool, a machine learning model used since 2016 to support hotline screening of child maltreatment referrals. We describe aspects of human-centered design that contributed to the successful deployment of this tool, including agency leadership and ownership, transparency by design, ethical oversight, community engagement, and social license. Finally, we identify potential next-steps to encourage greater integration of human-centered design into the development and implementation of machine learning decision support tools.

AB  - Objective This study investigated perspectives and experiences of artificial intelligence (AI) developers, clinicians and patients about the use of AI-based software in cardiac healthcare. Methods A qualitative study took place at two hospitals in England that had trialled AI-based software use in stress echocardiography, a scan that uses ultrasound to assess heart function. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with: patients (n = 9), clinicians (n = 16) and AI software developers (n = 5). Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results Potential benefits identified were increasing consistency and reliability through reducing human error, and greater efficiency. Concerns included over-reliance on the AI technology, and data security. Participants discussed the need for human input and empathy within healthcare, transparency about AI use, and issues around trusting AI. Participants considered AI's role as assisting diagnosis but not replacing clinician involvement. Clinicians and patients emphasised holistic diagnosis that involves more than the scan. Clinicians considered their diagnostic ability as superior and discrepancies were managed in line with clinicians' diagnoses rather than AI reports. The practicalities of using the AI software concerned image acquisition to meet AI processing requirements and workflow integration. Conclusions There was positivity towards AI use, but the AI software was considered an adjunct to clinicians rather than replacing their input. Clinicians' experiences were that their diagnostic ability remained superior to the AI, and acquiring images acceptable to AI was sometimes problematic. Despite hopes for increased efficiency through AI use, clinicians struggled to identify fit with clinical workflow to bring benefit.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) has great potential in diverse real-time mission-critical applications and one such application is telesurgery or robotic surgery. However, some issues like security, throughput, reliability, trust, and transparency are still challenging in an AI-enabled telesurgery system. Motivated from these challenges, in this paper, we propose a blockchain and AI-empowered telesurgery system towards 6G called BATS, which is a self-manageable, secure, transparent, and trustable system with massive Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (mURLLC). BATS uses AI algorithms such as eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to classify the disease with their criticality score ranging from 0 to 1. Moreover, BATS uses UAVs to transport light-weight healthcare items such as medicines and surgical tools in an emergent situation (during surgical procedures) to avoid road-traffic congestions. Results show that the proposed BATS scheme achieves better prediction accuracy, high throughput when the number of users increases, extremely low packet loss ratio, low storage cost, high mining profit, and low bandwidth consumption by the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) compared to the traditional HaBiTs and AaYusH schemes.

AB  - Healthcare organisations (HCOs) must prepare for large-scale implementation of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled tools that can demonstrably achieve one or more aims of better care, improved efficiency, enhanced professional and patient experience, and greater equity. Failure to do so may disadvantage patients, staff, and the organisation itself. We outline key strategies Australian HCOs should enact in maximising successful AI implementations: (1) establish transparent and accountable governance structures tasked to ensure responsible use of AI, including shifting organisational culture towards AI; (2) invest in delivering the human talent, technical infrastructure, and organisational change management that underpin a sustainable AI ecosystem; (3) gain staff and patient trust in using AI tools by virtue of their value to real world care and minimal threats to patient safety and privacy, existence of reliable governance, provision of appropriate training and opportunity for user co-design, transparency in AI tool use and consent, and retention of user agency in responding to AI generated advice; (4) establish risk assessment and mitigation processes that delineate unacceptable, high, medium, and low risk AI tools, based on task criticality and rigour of performance evaluations, and monitor and respond to any adverse impacts on patient outcomes; and (5) determine when and how liability for patient harm associated with a specific AI tool rests with, or is shared between, staff, developers, and the deploying HCO itself. In realising the benefits of AI, HCOs must build the necessary AI infrastructure, literacy, and cultural adaptation with foresighted planning and procurement of resources.

AB  - Breast cancer is a significant global health problem, and HER2-positive breast cancer accounts for a substantial proportion of cases. The combination of Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab monoclonal antibodies with chemotherapy has demonstrated effectiveness in achieving pathologic complete response (pCR) among HER2-positive breast cancer patients. This study aims to develop an interpretable machine learning model to predict pCR in patients undergoing this neoadjuvant treatment. Previous studies have explored predictors of pCR and utilized statistical techniques, but no prior research has applied machine learning to this specific treatment. This work proposes a rule-based interpretable method based on Dempster-Shafer theory. The model is trained using a dataset of 390 patients, with 57% achieving pCR. The performance of the model is compared with other classification algorithms, demonstrating its moderate but promising results. This work highlights the importance of combining accuracy and interpretability in healthcare applications, providing insights into the factors influencing treatment response in HER2-positive breast cancer patients.

AB  - Objectives Osteoarthritis (OA) patient stratification is an important challenge to design tailored treatments and drive drug development. Biochemical markers reflecting joint tissue turnover were measured in the IMI-APPROACH cohort at baseline and analysed using a machine learning approach in order to study OA-dominant phenotypes driven by the endotype-related clusters and discover the driving features and their disease-context meaning.
   Method Data quality assessment was performed to design appropriate data preprocessing techniques. The k-means clustering algorithm was used to find dominant subgroups of patients based on the biochemical markers data. Classification models were trained to predict cluster membership, and Explainable AI techniques were used to interpret these to reveal the driving factors behind each cluster and identify phenotypes. Statistical analysis was performed to compare differences between clusters with respect to other markers in the IMI-APPROACH cohort and the longitudinal disease progression.
   Results Three dominant endotypes were found, associated with three phenotypes: C1) low tissue turnover (low repair and articular cartilage/subchondral bone turnover), C2) structural damage (high bone formation/resorption, cartilage degradation) and C3) systemic inflammation (joint tissue degradation, inflammation, cartilage degradation). The method achieved consistent results in the FNIH/OAI cohort. C1 had the highest proportion of non-progressors. C2 was mostly linked to longitudinal structural progression, and C3 was linked to sustained or progressive pain.
   Conclusions This work supports the existence of differential phenotypes in OA. The biomarker approach could potentially drive stratification for OA clinical trials and contribute to precision medicine strategies for OA progression in the future.

AB  - Objective The complexity and rapid pace of development of algorithmic technologies pose challenges for their regulation and oversight in healthcare settings. We sought to improve our institution's approach to evaluation and governance of algorithmic technologies used in clinical care and operations by creating an Implementation Guide that standardizes evaluation criteria so that local oversight is performed in an objective fashion.Materials and Methods Building on a framework that applies key ethical and quality principles (clinical value and safety, fairness and equity, usability and adoption, transparency and accountability, and regulatory compliance), we created concrete guidelines for evaluating algorithmic technologies at our institution.Results An Implementation Guide articulates evaluation criteria used during review of algorithmic technologies and details what evidence supports the implementation of ethical and quality principles for trustworthy health AI. Application of the processes described in the Implementation Guide can lead to algorithms that are safer as well as more effective, fair, and equitable upon implementation, as illustrated through 4 examples of technologies at different phases of the algorithmic lifecycle that underwent evaluation at our academic medical center.Discussion By providing clear descriptions/definitions of evaluation criteria and embedding them within standardized processes, we streamlined oversight processes and educated communities using and developing algorithmic technologies within our institution.Conclusions We developed a scalable, adaptable framework for translating principles into evaluation criteria and specific requirements that support trustworthy implementation of algorithmic technologies in patient care and healthcare operations.

AB  - Background and Objective: Intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), also known as active parathyroid hormone, is an important indicator commonly for monitoring secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in patients undergoing hemodialysis. The aim of this study was to use machine learning (ML) models to predict monthly iPTH levels in patients undergoing hemodialysis. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study on patients undergoing regular hemodialysis. Patients' blood examinations data was collected from Taiwan Society of Nephrology - Kidney Dialysis, Transplantation (TSNKiDiT) registration system, and patients' medications data was collected from Pingtung Christian Hospital (PTCH), Taiwan. We used five different ML models to classify patients into three distinct categories based on their iPTH levels: iPTH < 150, iPTH >= 150 & iPTH < 600, and iPTH >= 600(pg/ml). Results: We ultimately included 1,351 patients in our study and processed the data in four different ways. These methods varied based on the duration of the data (either using data from just one month or continuously over three months) and the number of features used (either all 52 features or only 20 most important features identified by SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis). The XGBoost model, using data from a continuous three-month period and all available features, yielded the best Weighted AUROC (0.922). Conclusions: ML is highly effective in predicting iPTH levels in hemodialysis patients, notably accurate for those with iPTH over 600 pg/ml. This method enables early identification of high-risk patients, reducing reliance on retrospective blood test assessments. Future research should focus on advancing explainable AI methods to foster clinicians' trust, and developing adaptable ML frameworks that could seamlessly integrate with existing healthcare systems.

Despite its promising benefits in the current production landscape, Industry 5.0 faces critical challenges in scalability, workforce transition to collaborate with advanced technologies, high production costs, and privacy and security challenges in the post-quantum era. Thus, necessitates a shift towards more advanced Industrial paradigm that modernize and reinvent operations to synergize with high end sustainable and scalable machineries, products and processes. Industry 6.0 is defined as ubiquitous, hyper-customer driven, virtualized, and sustainable manufacturing, where focus is towards hyper-connected factories and dynamic supply chains. Industry 6.0 is expected to connect cross-vertical applications, and in this paper, we present a tutorial-based survey on the vision, technical landscape, and advancements which would drive the Industry 6.0. New concepts are introduced over Industry 5.0 processes to support industrial applications like supply-chain based productions, human-robotic industrial pipelines, green computing, and generative artificial intelligence (GAI) induction in control processes. We highlight the key enablers to support the 6.0 vision-automated digital twins, metaverseassisted virtual production, 6G, dew computing, GAI Cobots Networks (GOBOTs), Internet-of-Anything (IoX), quantum-assisted nano production, and other technologies. We highlight the reference architecture, Industry 6.0 vision, features, components, and the threats surrounding Industry 6.0, and solutions. We also present the sustainability aspects of Industry 6.0, and finally discuss future challenges and directions. The article is presented to assist researchers, industry practitioners, and allied stakeholders to design cost-effective, customized, and process driven Industrial operations.

KW  - MANAGEMENT
AB  - The response rate of cancer immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) varies among patients, making it challenging to pre-determine whether a particular patient will respond to immunotherapy. While gene mutation is critical to the treatment outcome, a framework capable of explicitly incorporating biology knowledge has yet to be established. Here we aim to propose and validate a mutation-based deep learning model for survival analysis on 1571 patients treated with ICI. Our model achieves an average concordance index of 0.59 +/- 0.13 across nine types of cancer, compared to the gold standard Cox-PH model (0.52 +/- 0.10). The "black box" nature of deep learning is a major concern in healthcare field. This model's interpretability, which results from incorporating the gene pathways and protein interaction (i.e., biology-aware) rather than relying on a 'black box' approach, helps patient stratification and provides insight into novel gene biomarkers, advancing our understanding of ICI treatment.

AB  - ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to develop a hybrid diagnostic framework integrating radiomic and deep features for accurate and reproducible detection and classification of wrist fractures using X-ray images.Materials and MethodsA total of 3,537 X-ray images, including 1,871 fracture and 1,666 non-fracture cases, were collected from three healthcare centers. Radiomic features were extracted using the PyRadiomics library, and deep features were derived from the bottleneck layer of an autoencoder. Both feature modalities underwent reliability assessment via Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) and cosine similarity. Feature selection methods, including ANOVA, Mutual Information (MI), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), were applied to optimize the feature set. Classifiers such as XGBoost, CatBoost, Random Forest, and a Voting Classifier were used to evaluate diagnostic performance. The dataset was divided into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets, and metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and AUC-ROC were used for evaluation.ResultsThe combined radiomic and deep feature approach consistently outperformed standalone methods. The Voting Classifier paired with MI achieved the highest performance, with a test accuracy of 95%, sensitivity of 94%, and AUC-ROC of 96%. The end-to-end model achieved competitive results with an accuracy of 93% and AUC-ROC of 94%. SHAP analysis and t-SNE visualizations confirmed the interpretability and robustness of the selected features.ConclusionsThis hybrid framework demonstrates the potential for integrating radiomic and deep features to enhance diagnostic performance for wrist and forearm fractures, providing a reliable and interpretable solution suitable for clinical applications.

AB  - BackgroundThe application of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is an area of immense interest. The high profile of 'AI in health' means that there are unusually strong drivers to accelerate the introduction and implementation of innovative AI interventions, which may not be supported by the available evidence, and for which the usual systems of appraisal may not yet be sufficient.Main textWe are beginning to see the emergence of randomised clinical trials evaluating AI interventions in real-world settings. It is imperative that these studies are conducted and reported to the highest standards to enable effective evaluation because they will potentially be a key part of the evidence that is used when deciding whether an AI intervention is sufficiently safe and effective to be approved and commissioned. Minimum reporting guidelines for clinical trial protocols and reports have been instrumental in improving the quality of clinical trials and promoting completeness and transparency of reporting for the evaluation of new health interventions. The current guidelines-SPIRIT and CONSORT-are suited to traditional health interventions but research has revealed that they do not adequately address potential sources of bias specific to AI systems. Examples of elements that require specific reporting include algorithm version and the procedure for acquiring input data. In response, the SPIRIT-AI and CONSORT-AI guidelines were developed by a multidisciplinary group of international experts using a consensus building methodological process. The extensions include a number of new items that should be reported in addition to the core items. Each item, where possible, was informed by challenges identified in existing studies of AI systems in health settings.ConclusionThe SPIRIT-AI and CONSORT-AI guidelines provide the first international standards for clinical trials of AI systems. The guidelines are designed to ensure complete and transparent reporting of clinical trial protocols and reports involving AI interventions and have the potential to improve the quality of these clinical trials through improvements in their design and delivery. Their use will help to efficiently identify the safest and most effective AI interventions and commission them with confidence for the benefit of patients and the public.

AB  - Objective To develop and validate an interpretable machine learning (ML)-based frailty risk prediction model that combines real-time health data with validated scale assessments for enhanced decision-making and targeted health management in integrated medical and older adult care institutions (IMOACIs) in central China.Design Mixed-methods, cross-sectional study.Setting 13 IMOACIs across seven cities in Hunan province, central China, from 8 to 16 July 2022.Participants Five healthcare experts and two data scientists participated in the requirements analysis stage. A total of 586 older adults were included in the assessment data collection stage, and 15 participants (10 healthcare professionals and five data scientists) were involved in the model evaluation stage.Methods A collaborative requirements analysis involving healthcare professionals and data scientists guided the design of an interpretable frailty risk prediction model. Five machine learning models were developed and evaluated: logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), random forest, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and a multimodel ensemble approach. Hyperparameter optimisation was performed using stratified fivefold cross-validation with grid search, incorporating class-weighted loss functions to address class imbalance and model-specific regularisation techniques to maximise performance while preventing overfitting. To enhance interpretability, the model incorporated Shapley Additive Explanations. The final model was integrated into a user-facing platform and validated using cross-sectional standardised assessment data collected from 13 IMOACIs. A mixed-methods evaluation approach combined quantitative performance metrics with qualitative user experience assessments.Results The dataset (n=586) was randomly split into training (n=468) and validation (n=118) sets (4:1 ratio). Among models, XGBoost demonstrated superior performance, achieving an accuracy of 0.89 and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.89 on the training set. On the validation set, the XGBoost model achieved a precision of 0.76, recall of 0.72, F1 score of 0.74, accuracy of 0.83 and AUC of 0.80, outperforming other models. User experience surveys yielded high mean ratings for satisfaction (4.20/5), perceived accuracy (4.20/5), interpretability (4.30/5) and application value (4.10/5). Qualitative analysis of user feedback identified six key themes: practical and application value, performance and data analysis, interpretability and comprehensibility, impact and integration into practice, limitations and areas for improvement, and future development and innovation prospects, highlighting the model's strong potential for practical implementation.Conclusions This novel, interpretable ML-based frailty risk prediction model can enhance decision-making in the care of older adults by providing transparent predictions and identifying crucial factors associated with frailty. It establishes a foundation for targeted management and broader ML applications in healthcare systems, such as IMOACIs, particularly in developing regions.

AB  - Background Sepsis is a major cause of mortality in intensive care units (ICUs) and continues to pose a significant global health challenge, with sepsis-related deaths contributing substantially to the overall burden on healthcare systems worldwide. The primary objective was to construct and evaluate a machine learning (ML) model for forecasting 28-day all-cause mortality among ICU sepsis patients.Methods Data for the study was sourced from the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) (version 2.0). The main outcome was 28-day all-cause mortality. Predictor selection for the final model was conducted using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis and the Boruta feature selection algorithm. Five machine learning algorithms including logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), support vector machine (SVM), and light gradient boosting machine (lightGBM) were employed to construct models using 10-fold cross-validation. Model performance was evaluated using AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, recall, and F1 score. Additionally, we performed an interpretability analysis on the model that showed the most stable performance.Results The final study cohort comprised 4564 patients, among whom 568 (12.4%) died within 28 days of ICU admission. The XGBoost algorithm demonstrated the most reliable performance, achieving an AUC of 0.821, balancing sensitivity (0.703) and specificity (0.798). The top three risk predictors of mortality included APACHE score, serum lactate levels, and AST.Conclusion ML models reliably predicted 28-day mortality in critically ill sepsis patients. Of the models evaluated, the XGBoost algorithm exhibited the most stable performance in identifying patients at elevated mortality risk. Model interpretability analysis identified crucial predictors, potentially informing clinical decisions for sepsis patients in the ICU.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) offers the potential to revolutionize healthcare, from improving diagnoses to patient safety. However, many healthcare practitioners are hesitant to adopt AI technolo-gies fully. To understand why, this research explored clinicians' views on AI, especially their level of trust, their concerns about potential risks, and how they believe AI might affect their day-to-day workload. We surveyed 265 healthcare professionals from various specialties in the U.S. The survey aimed to understand their perceptions and any concerns they might have about AI in their clinical practice. We further examined how these perceptions might align with three hypothetical approaches to integrating AI into healthcare: no integration, sequential (step-by-step) integration, and parallel (side-by-side with current practices) integration. The results reveal that clinicians who view AI as a workload reducer are more inclined to trust it and are more likely to use it in clinical decision making. However, those perceiving higher risks with AI are less inclined to adopt it in decision making. While the role of clinical experience was found to be statistically insignificant in influencing trust in AI and AI-driven decision making, further research might explore other potential moderating variables, such as technical aptitude, previous exposure to AI, or the specific medical specialty of the clinician. By evaluating three hypothetical scenarios of AI integration in healthcare, our study elucidates the potential pitfalls of sequential AI integration and the comparative advantages of parallel integration. In conclusion, this study underscores the necessity of strategic AI integration into healthcare. AI should be perceived as a supportive tool rather than an intrusive entity, augmenting the clinicians' skills and facilitating their workflow rather than disrupting it. As we move towards an increasingly digitized future in healthcare, comprehending the among AI technology, clinician perception, trust, and decision making is fundamental.

AB  - Drone-based systems supporting Search and Rescue (SAR) missions help expeditiously improve the possibility of discovering the missing victims. Nonetheless, the current drone-based systems have some limitations, such as the need for humans in control of large-scale drones, drone's energy inefficiency, repercussion of quality of service (QoS) from abnormalities events, shortages of automaticity and real-time interactions, deficiency of swift decisions from artificial intelligence-based SAR, and underestimation of security issues in SAR systems. Therefore, developing a more advanced drone-based system is necessary to overcome these limitations. However, it is challenging to achieve the target due to trade-off relationships of technologies and strict requirements of time-critical SAR. This paper studies the feasibility of an Internet-of-Drones (IoD) system using blockchain and artificial intelligence at the edge to overcome limitations and improve SAR QoS. An advanced IoD system architecture from drones to a back-end system and end-users terminals has been proposed. Furthermore, advanced edge services and artificial intelligence at the edge have been presented for automatically searching for missing persons. In addition, computation offloading approaches have been provided to improve the energy efficiency of drones and reduce system latency. Last but not least, public and private blockchain, including Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric, for providing secure and decentralized healthcare platform has been investigated and analyzed to enable real-time interaction between healthcare entities and improves healthcare services. The results show that the proposed system helps overcome the limitations and improve the SAR QoS. Besides, the proposed system satisfies the security requirements, including confidentiality, integrity, authentication, authorization, access control, privacy, trust, transparency, availability, automaticity, and tolerance.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI)-based multi-modal fusion algorithms are pivotal in emulating clinical practice by integrating data from diverse sources. However, most of the existing multi-modal models focus on designing new modal fusion methods, ignoring critical role of feature representation. Enhancing feature representativeness can address the noise caused by modal heterogeneity at the source, enabling high performance even with small datasets and simple architectures. Here, we introduce DeepOmix-FLEX (Fusion with Learning Enhanced feature representation for X-modal or FLEX in short), a multi-modal fusion model that integrates clinical data, proteomic data, metabolomic data, and pathology images across different scales and modalities, with a focus on advanced feature learning and representation. FLEX contains a Feature Encoding Trainer structure that can train feature encoding, thus achieving fusion of inter-feature and inter-modal. FLEX achieves a mean AUC of 0.887 for prediction of chronic kidney disease progression on an internal dataset, exceeding the mean AUC of 0.727 using conventional clinical variables. Following external validation and interpretability analyses, our model demonstrated favorable generalizability and validity, as well as the ability to exploit markers. In summary, FLEX highlights the potential of AI algorithms to integrate multi-modal data and optimize the allocation of healthcare resources through accurate prediction.

AB  - Medical training is a key element in maintaining and improving today's healthcare standards. Given the nature of medical work, students must master not only theory but also develop their hands-on abilities and skills in clinical practice. Medical simulators play an increasing role in supporting the active learning of these students due to their ability to present a large variety of tasks allowing students to train and experiment indefinitely without causing any patient harm. While the criticality of explainable AI systems has been extensively discussed in the literature, the medical training context presents unique user needs for explanations. In this paper, we explore the potential gap of current limitations within simulation-based training, and the role Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds in supporting the needs of medical students in training. Through contextual inquiries and interviews with clinicians in training (N = 9) and subsequent validation with medical experts (N = 4), we obtain an understanding of the shortcomings in current simulation-based training and offer recommendations for future AI-driven training. Our results stress the need for continuous and actionable feedback that resembles the interaction between clinical supervisor and resident in real-world training scenarios while adjusting training material to the residents' skills and prior performance.

AB  - As intelligent vehicles (IVs) continue to advance in fully connected environments, the collection of data from various sources in intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) has reached unprecedented levels. This paper aims to provide an integrative review of the processing and utilization of this vast data for optimizing smart mobility (SM) and extracting actionable insights to enhance planning and decision-making. While the data science (DS) frameworks have proven its effectiveness in sectors such as healthcare, tourism, social media, and the internet industries, there remains a lack of systematic research on DS in the context of SM (referred to as (DSM)-M-2) within the ITS field. In this paper, we examine the potential applications of DS in IV systems by exploring relevant literature in DS domains, including discussions on data uncertainty, deep learning-based interpretability, reinforcement learning, and the relationships within IV data. These applications include IV control systems, data analytics visualisation, parallel-driving IV systems, and other (DSM)-M-2 applications. Furthermore, the analysis of seminal and recent literature emphasizes the absence of widely recognized benchmarks, which poses challenges to the validation and demonstration of new studies in this evolving domain.

AB  - Background Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) is a widely used, device-based therapy for patients with left ventricle (LV) failure. Unfortunately, many patients do not benefit from CRT, so there is potential value in identifying this group of non-responders before CRT implementation. Past studies suggest that predicting CRT response will require diverse variables, including demographic, biomarker, and LV function data. Accordingly, the objective of this study was to integrate diverse variable types into a machine learning algorithm for predicting individual patient responses to CRT. Methods We built an ensemble classification algorithm using previously acquired data from the SMART-AV CRT clinical trial (n = 794 patients). We used five-fold stratified cross-validation on 80% of the patients (n = 635) to train the model with variables collected at 0 months (before initiating CRT), and the remaining 20% of the patients (n = 159) were used as a hold-out test set for model validation. To improve model interpretability, we quantified feature importance values using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis and used Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) to explain patient-specific predictions. Results Our classification algorithm incorporated 26 patient demographic and medical history variables, 12 biomarker variables, and 18 LV functional variables, which yielded correct prediction of CRT response in 71% of patients. Additional patient stratification to identify the subgroups with the highest or lowest likelihood of response showed 96% accuracy with 22 correct predictions out of 23 patients in the highest and lowest responder groups. Conclusion Computationally integrating general patient characteristics, comorbidities, therapy history, circulating biomarkers, and LV function data available before CRT intervention can improve the prediction of individual patient responses.

AB  - BackgroundApplying artificial intelligence (AI) to nursing practice has dramatically enhanced healthcare delivery in Arab countries. However, AI application also raises complex moral issues, including patient privacy, data security, responsibility, transparency, and equity in decision-making.AimA systematic analysis of the ethical issues surrounding the application of AI in nursing practice in Arab nations is carried out in this review, highlighting the most important ethical issues and recommending responsible AI integration.MethodsA comprehensive literature search was conducted across major databases. Following the initial identification of 150 articles, 120 were selected for full-text review based on the title and abstract screening. Subsequently, 50 pertinent studies were incorporated into this review.ResultsNumerous significant ethical concerns regarding AI application in decision-making processes were identified. The assessment also highlighted the possible effects of AI on the nurse-patient interaction and the critical role played by the ethics committees and regulatory frameworks in resolving these issues.ConclusionEthical frameworks must be established to guarantee AI integration into nursing practice, safeguard patients' welfare, and strengthen the trust between healthcare providers and patients.Clinical trialNo clinical Trial.
   AI application in nursing practice is an opportunity and a challenge for Arab countries. Artificial Intelligence is of much help for decision-making, monitoring, and automating tasks, raising several ethical concerns regarding privacy, accuracy, and bias. It is the responsibility of nurses to make AI use transparent and nondiscriminatory, communicate effectively with their patients, and respect their autonomy. Ongoing training is essential to navigate AI's impact on care. Ethical issues include protecting vulnerable groups, ensuring fairness, and maintaining empathy, especially in end-of-life care. Regulations and guidelines are vital to ensure AI respects cultural values and patients' rights, balancing technological advancements with compassionate, equitable care.

AB  - Background: This present work focused on predicting prognostic outcomes of inpatients developing acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD), and enhancing patient monitoring and treatment by using objective clinical indicators. Methods: The present retrospective study enrolled 322 AECOPD patients. Registry data downloaded based on the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Pay-for-Performance Program database from January 2012 to December 2018 were used to check whether the enrolled patients were eligible. Our primary and secondary outcomes were intensive care unit (ICU) admission and in-hospital mortality, respectively. The best feature subset was chosen by recursive feature elimination. Moreover, 7 machine learning (ML) models were trained for forecasting ICU admission among AECOPD patients, and the model with the most excellent performance was used. Results: According to our findings, a random forest (RF) model showed superb discrimination performance, and the values of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were 0.973 and 0.828 in training and test cohorts, separately. Additionally, according to decision curve analysis, the net benefit of the RF model was higher when differentiating patients with a high risk of ICU admission at a <0.55 threshold probability. Moreover, the ML-based prediction model was also constructed to predict in-hospital mortality, and it showed excellent calibration and discrimination capacities. Conclusion: The ML model was highly accurate in assessing the ICU admission and in-hospital mortality risk for AECOPD cases. Maintenance of model interpretability helped effectively provide accurate and lucid risk prediction of different individuals.

AB  - Machine learning started as an academic-oriented domain, but nowadays it is becoming more and more widespread across diverse domains, such as retail, healthcare, finance, and many more. This non-academic face of machine learning creates a new set of challenges. The usage of such complex methods by nonexpert users has increased the need for interpretable models. To this end, in this paper we propose an approach for extracting explanation rules from support vector machines. The core idea is based on using kernels with feature spaces composed by logical propositions. On top of that, a searching algorithm tries to retrieve the most relevant features/rules that can be used to explain the trained model. Experiments on both categorical and real-valued datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives This study examines the ethical and privacy challenges of integrating generative artificial intelligence (AI) into electronic health record (EHR) systems, focusing on Tanzania's healthcare context. It critically analyses the extent to which Tanzania's Policy Framework for Artificial Intelligence in the Health Sector (2022) addresses these challenges and proposes regulatory and practical safeguards for responsible generative AI deployment.Methods A systematic scoping review was conducted using PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Scopus and Google Scholar to identify relevant studies published between 2014 and 2024. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines informed the search and selection process. Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria and were thematically analysed to identify key ethical and privacy concerns of generative AI in healthcare. Moreover, a policy analysis of Tanzania's AI framework was conducted to assess its alignment with global best practices and regulatory preparedness.Results The review identified six key ethical and privacy challenges associated with generative AI in EHR systems: data privacy and security risks, algorithmic bias and fairness concerns, transparency and accountability issues, consent and autonomy challenges, human oversight gaps and risks of data re-identification. The policy analysis revealed that while Tanzania's AI framework aligns with national health priorities and promotes capacity building and ethical governance, it lacks generative AI-specific guidelines, regulatory clarity and resource mobilisation strategies necessary for healthcare settings.Conclusion Integrating generative AI into Tanzania's EHR systems presents transformative opportunities and significant ethical and privacy risks. Tanzania's policy framework should incorporate AI-specific ethical guidelines, operationalise regulatory mechanisms, foster stakeholder engagement through participatory co-design and strengthen infrastructural investments. These measures will promote ethical integrity, enhance patient trust and position Tanzania as a regional leader in responsible AI use in healthcare.

AB  - The development of reliable mortality risk stratification models is an active research area in computational healthcare. Mortality risk stratification provides a standard to assist physicians in evaluating a patient's condition or prognosis objectively. Particular interest lies in methods that are transparent to clinical interpretation and that retain predictive power once validated across diverse datasets they were not trained on. This study addresses the challenge of consolidating numerous ICD codes for predictive modeling of ICU mortality, employing a hybrid modeling approach that integrates mechanistic, clinical knowledge with mathematical and machine learning models . A tree-structured network connecting independent modules that carry clinical meaning is implemented for interpretability. Our training strategy utilizes graph-theoretic methods for data analysis, aiming to identify the functions of individual black-box modules within the tree-structured network by harnessing solutions from specific max-cut problems. The trained model is then validated on external datasets from different hospitals, demonstrating successful generalization capabilities, particularly in binary-feature datasets where label assessment involves extrapolation.

AB  - Nowadays, blockchain technology is one of the advanced technologies to ensure the security of users' sensitive or confidential data. Blockchain technology plays a vital role in various appli-cations like artificial intelligence, supply chain, cloud computing, the healthcare sector, and many more. It helps the healthcare domain to get benefitted from its many advanced features, such as confidentiality, decentralization, security, and privacy. Also, the Internet of Things (IoT) devices connect with the healthcare systems, and the healthcare sector application software further communicates with the IT industry. The blockchain-based IoT systems have significantly impacted the healthcare sector by enhancing security, privacy, transparency, and efficiency, providing better business opportunities. Moreover, traditional healthcare systems face severe security and privacy problems, such as phishing, masquerades, identity theft, and many others. Thus, a secure blockchain-based Proposed Application (PA) is designed to generate, maintain, and validate healthcare certificates. The PA acts as a communication medium between the backend blockchain network and application entities like hospitals, patients, doctors, and IoT devices to create and verify medical certificates. It also ensures various security features, namely confi-dentiality, authentication, and access control, using the concept of smart contracts. The comparative and performance analysis of the proposed work shows that it provides a more effective solution than the existing schemes.

AB  - As the aging population grows, ensuring effective and sustainable health management for elderly individuals has become a critical challenge. This study explores the integration of smart healthcare technologies and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) principles to enhance elderly health management through data-driven strategies. Using the MIMIC-III database, this study evaluates five machine learning models (Adaboost, Bagging, Catboost, GaussianNB, and SVC) through ten-fold cross-validation to predict 3-day and 30-day mortality rates among elderly ICU patients. The Bagging model achieved the best performance with an AUROC of 0.80, demonstrating the potential of smart healthcare in mortality prediction. These technologies enhance predictive accuracy, enabling the timely identification of high-risk patients and effective intervention. Through the application of smart data integration methods, this study demonstrates how combining clinical indicators with socioeconomic factors can improve healthcare equity and efficiency. Furthermore, by aligning smart healthcare development with ESG concepts, we emphasize the importance of sustainability, social responsibility, and governance transparency in future healthcare systems. The findings offer valuable contributions toward building an interoperable and ethical health ecosystem, supporting early risk identification, improved care outcomes, and the promotion of healthy living for the elderly population.

AB  - Background: Early identification of sexually transmissible infections (STIs) is central to their control by facilitating timely access to healthcare. A web-based sexual health application using artificial intelligence (AI) to identify the risk of a genital or anal lesion being an STI, from a photographic image, is in development. However, the usefulness, accessibility, and acceptability of this technology to potential users are unknown. Method: This research adopted a developmental evaluation approach to explore potential users' views of the usefulness of this AI application, as well as factors impacting its acceptability and accessibility. Three focus groups were conducted with attendees of a sexual health clinic. Focus group discussions were recorded, transcribed, and analysed using action coding to identify key concepts. Results: A diverse group of 12 participants provided feedback on the proposed application. Feedback on the application's usefulness highlighted its potential value in supporting access to individualised sexual health information; informing decisions about healthcare seeking; and preventing transmission to others. Factors mediating the accessibility and acceptability of AI-powered applications included potential users' awareness of the application; concerns about data security; the accessibility of the application to diverse user groups; trust in the technology; and transparency about the application's limitations. Conclusion: AI applications for the identification of visible changes in the ano-genital region have the potential to support access to sexual health information, healthcare seeking and the prevention of onward transmission of STIs. Codesign approaches will increase the likelihood of more widespread uptake and public health impact of AI-powered sexual health applications.

AB  - Recent studies show promising potential for artificial intelligence (AI) to assist healthcare providers (HCPs) in skin cancer care. The aim of this study is to explore the views of dermatologists and general practitioners (GPs) regarding the successful implementation of AI when assisting HCPs in skin cancer care. We performed a qualitative focus group study, consisting of six focus groups with 16 dermatologists and 17 GPs, varying in prior knowledge and experience with AI, gender, and age. An in-depth inductive thematic content analysis was deployed. Perceived benefits, barriers, and preconditions were identified as main themes. Dermatologists and GPs perceive substantial benefits of AI, particularly an improved health outcome and care pathway between primary and secondary care. Doubts about accuracy, risk of health inequalities, and fear of replacement were among the most stressed barriers. Essential preconditions included adequate algorithm content, sufficient usability, and accessibility of AI. In conclusion, dermatologists and GPs perceive significant benefits from implementing AI in skin cancer care. However, to successfully implement AI, key barriers need to be addressed. Efforts should focus on ensuring algorithm transparency, validation, accessibility for all skin types, and adequate regulation of algorithms. Simultaneously, improving knowledge about AI could reduce the fear of replacement.

AB  - Objectives Artificial intelligence (AI) is seen as a major disrupting force in the future healthcare system. However, the assessment of the value of AI technologies is still unclear. Therefore, a multidisciplinary group of experts and patients developed a Model for ASsessing the value of AI (MAS-AI) in medical imaging. Medical imaging is chosen due to the maturity of AI in this area, ensuring a robust evidence-based model. Methods MAS-AI was developed in three phases. First, a literature review of existing guides, evaluations, and assessments of the value of AI in the field of medical imaging. Next, we interviewed leading researchers in AI in Denmark. The third phase consisted of two workshops where decision makers, patient organizations, and researchers discussed crucial topics for evaluating AI. The multidisciplinary team revised the model between workshops according to comments. Results The MAS-AI guideline consists of two steps covering nine domains and five process factors supporting the assessment. Step 1 contains a description of patients, how the AI model was developed, and initial ethical and legal considerations. In step 2, a multidisciplinary assessment of outcomes of the AI application is done for the five remaining domains: safety, clinical aspects, economics, organizational aspects, and patient aspects. Conclusions We have developed an health technology assessment-based framework to support the introduction of AI technologies into healthcare in medical imaging. It is essential to ensure informed and valid decisions regarding the adoption of AI with a structured process and tool. MAS-AI can help support decision making and provide greater transparency for all parties.

AB  - Background: Health professionals are often faced with the need to identify women at risk of manifesting poor psychological resilience following the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. Machine learning algorithms are increasingly used to support clinical decision support (CDS) tools in helping health professionals identify women who are at risk of adverse well-being outcomes and plan customized psychological interventions for women at risk. Clinical flexibility, cross-validated performance accuracy, and model explainability permitting person-specific identification of risk factors are highly desirable features of such tools. Objective: This study aimed to develop and cross-validate machine learning models designed to identify breast cancer survivors at risk of poor overall mental health and global quality of life and identify potential targets of personalized psychological interventions according to an extensive set of clinical recommendations. Methods: A set of 12 alternative models was developed to improve the clinical flexibility of the CDS tool. All models were validated using longitudinal data from a prospective, multicenter clinical pilot at 5 major oncology centers in 4 countries (Italy, project). A total of 706 patients with highly treatable breast cancer were enrolled shortly after diagnosis and before the onset of oncological treatments and were followed up for 18 months. An extensive set of demographic, lifestyle, clinical, psychological, and biological variables measured within 3 months after enrollment served as predictors. Rigorous feature selection isolated key psychological resilience outcomes that could be incorporated into future clinical practice. Results: Balanced random forest classifiers were successful at predicting well-being outcomes, with accuracies ranging between 78% and 82% (for 12-month end points after diagnosis) and between 74% and 83% (for 18-month end points after diagnosis). Explainability and interpretability analyses built on the best-performing models were used to identify potentially modifiable psychological and lifestyle characteristics that, if addressed systematically in the context of personalized psychological interventions, would be most likely to promote resilience for a given patient. Conclusions: Our results highlight the clinical utility of the BOUNCE modeling approach by focusing on resilience predictors that can be readily available to practicing clinicians at major oncology centers. The BOUNCE CDS tool paves the way for personalized risk assessment methods to identify patients at high risk of adverse well-being outcomes and direct valuable resources toward those most in need of specialized psychological interventions.

AB  - BackgroundThe growing application of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare has brought technological breakthroughs to traditional diagnosis and treatment, but it is accompanied by many risks and challenges. These adverse effects are also seen as ethical issues and affect trustworthiness in medical AI and need to be managed through identification, prognosis and monitoring.MethodsWe adopted a multidisciplinary approach and summarized five subjects that influence the trustworthiness of medical AI: data quality, algorithmic bias, opacity, safety and security, and responsibility attribution, and discussed these factors from the perspectives of technology, law, and healthcare stakeholders and institutions. The ethical framework of ethical values-ethical principles-ethical norms is used to propose corresponding ethical governance countermeasures for trustworthy medical AI from the ethical, legal, and regulatory aspects.ResultsMedical data are primarily unstructured, lacking uniform and standardized annotation, and data quality will directly affect the quality of medical AI algorithm models. Algorithmic bias can affect AI clinical predictions and exacerbate health disparities. The opacity of algorithms affects patients' and doctors' trust in medical AI, and algorithmic errors or security vulnerabilities can pose significant risks and harm to patients. The involvement of medical AI in clinical practices may threaten doctors 'and patients' autonomy and dignity. When accidents occur with medical AI, the responsibility attribution is not clear. All these factors affect people's trust in medical AI.ConclusionsIn order to make medical AI trustworthy, at the ethical level, the ethical value orientation of promoting human health should first and foremost be considered as the top-level design. At the legal level, current medical AI does not have moral status and humans remain the duty bearers. At the regulatory level, strengthening data quality management, improving algorithm transparency and traceability to reduce algorithm bias, and regulating and reviewing the whole process of the AI industry to control risks are proposed. It is also necessary to encourage multiple parties to discuss and assess AI risks and social impacts, and to strengthen international cooperation and communication.

AB  - Predicting treatment outcome in internalizing mental disorders prior to treatment initiation is pivotal for precision mental healthcare. In this regard, resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) and machine learning have often shown promising prediction accuracies. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates these studies, considering their risk of bias through the Prediction Model Study Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST). We examined the predictive performance of features derived from rs-FC, identified features with the highest predictive value, and assessed the employed machine learning pipelines. We searched the electronic databases Scopus, PubMed and PsycINFO on the 12th of December 2022, which resulted in 13 included studies. The mean balanced accuracy for predicting treatment outcome was 77% (95% CI: [72%- 83%]). rs-FC of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex had high predictive value in most studies. However, a high risk of bias was identified in all studies, compromising interpretability. Methodological recommendations are provided based on a comprehensive exploration of the studies' machine learning pipelines, and potential fruitful developments are discussed.

AB  - Assessing the health condition has a wide range of applications in healthcare, military, aerospace, and industrial fields. Nevertheless, traditional feature-engineered techniques involve manual feature extraction, which are too cumbersome to adapt to the changes caused by the development of sensor network technology. Recently, deep-learning-based methods have achieved initial success in health-condition assessment research, but insufficient considerations for problems such as class skewness, noisy segments, and result interpretability make it difficult to apply them to real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a K-margin-based Interpretable Learning approach for health-condition assessment. In detail, a skewness-aware RCR-Net model is employed to handle problems of class skewness. Furthermore, we present a diagnosis model based on K-margin to automatically handle noisy segments by naturally exploiting expected consistency among the segments associated with each record. Additionally, a knowledge-directed interpretation method is presented to learn domain knowledge-level features automatically without the help of human experts which can be used as an interpretable decision-making basis. Finally, through experimental validation in the field of both medical and aerospace, the proposed method has a better generality and high efficiency with 0.7974 and 0.8005 F1 scores, which outperform all state-of-the-art deep learning methods for health-condition assessment task by 3.30% and 2.99%, respectively.

AB  - Background Acute neurological complications are some of the leading causes of death and disability in the U.S. The medical professionals that treat patients in this setting are tasked with deciding where (e.g., home or facility), how, and when to discharge these patients. It is important to be able to predict potential patient discharge outcomes as early as possible during the patient's hospital stay and to know what factors influence the development of discharge planning. This study carried out two parallel experiments: A multi-class outcome (patient discharge targets of 'home', 'nursing facility', 'rehab', 'death') and binary class outcome ('home' vs. 'non-home'). The goal of this study is to develop early predictive models for each experiment exploring which patient characteristics and clinical variables significantly influence discharge planning of patients based on the data that are available only within 24 h of their hospital admission. Method Our methodology centers around building and training five different machine learning models followed by testing and tuning those models to find the best-suited predictor for each experiment with a dataset of 5,245 adult patients with neurological conditions taken from the eICU-CRD database. Results The results of this study show XGBoost to be the most effective model for predicting between four common discharge outcomes of 'home', 'nursing facility', 'rehab', and 'death', with 71% average c-statistic. The XGBoost model was also the best-performer in the binary outcome experiment with a c-statistic of 76%. This article also explores the accuracy, reliability, and interpretability of the best performing models in each experiment by identifying and analyzing the features that are most impactful to the predictions. Conclusions The acceptable accuracy and interpretability of the predictive models based on early admission data suggests that the models can be used in a suggestive context to help guide healthcare providers in efforts of planning effective and equitable discharge recommendations.

AB  - In recent years, the rapid advancement of machine learning (ML), particularly deep learning (DL), has revolutionized various fields, with healthcare being one of the most notable beneficiaries. DL has demonstrated exceptional capabilities in addressing complex medical challenges, including the early detection and diagnosis of cancer. Its superior performance, surpassing both traditional ML methods and human accuracy, has made it a critical tool in identifying and diagnosing diseases such as cancer. Despite the availability of numerous reviews on DL applications in healthcare, a comprehensive and detailed understanding of DL's role in cancer detection remains lacking. Most existing studies focus on specific aspects of DL, leaving significant gaps in the broader knowledge base. This paper aims to bridge these gaps by offering a thorough review of advanced DL techniques, namely transfer learning (TL), reinforcement learning (RL), federated learning (FL), Transformers, and large language models (LLMs). These cutting-edge approaches are pushing the boundaries of cancer detection by enhancing model accuracy, addressing data scarcity, and enabling decentralized learning across institutions while maintaining data privacy. TL enables the adaptation of pre-trained models to new cancer datasets, significantly improving performance with limited labeled data. RL is emerging as a promising method for optimizing diagnostic pathways and treatment strategies, while FL ensures collaborative model development without sharing sensitive patient data. Furthermore, Transformers and LLMs, traditionally utilized in natural language processing (NLP), are now being applied to medical data for enhanced interpretability and context-based predictions. In addition, this review explores the efficiency of the aforementioned techniques in cancer diagnosis, it addresses key challenges such as data imbalance, and proposes potential solutions. It aims to be a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners, offering insights into current trends and guiding future research in the application of advanced DL techniques for cancer detection.

AB  - Diagnostic discrepancies, a persistent threat in healthcare, compromise patient outcomes and hinder effective treatment. Despite their prevalence, addressing diagnostic discrepancies remains a complex challenge due to the limitations of traditional methods and fragmented and inaccessible data. The emergence of machine learning (ML) offers a promising solution by analyzing vast medical datasets to detect subtle disease signatures and improve treatment personalization with unparalleled precision. However, data quality and availability remain significant barriers, as incompleteness, inconsistencies, and biases can distort ML models, leading to potentially harmful misinterpretations. This paper highlights the critical role of diagnostic discrepancy statistics in overcoming these challenges and proposes a standardized data schema that ensures interoperable, real-time, and historical data without compromising patient privacy. By addressing the current lack of accessible diagnostic discrepancy data, the schema lays a foundation for more effective analysis, better patient outcomes, and improved use of machine learning in healthcare. The key contribution of this paper is the framework that allows for increased data transparency and improved data quality.

AB  - The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) in healthcare systems introduces critical security vulnerabilities, including data tampering, unauthorized access, and adversarial attacks, jeopardizing patient safety and regulatory compliance. This paper proposes BDCDC, a novel blockchain-deep learning framework designed to fortify data integrity and threat detection in IoT-imbued healthcare networks. BDCDC synergizes a blockchain layer, leveraging zero-knowledge protocols (ZKP) for privacy-preserving device authentication and smart contract-driven enhanced Proof-of-Work (ePoW) consensus, with a deep learning layer employing a Deep Variational Autoencoder (DVAE) for noise-resistant feature extraction and a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) model for real-time anomaly detection. To address scalability, an InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) offloads bulk data storage, minimizing blockchain overhead. Evaluated on the CICIDS-2017 and ToN-IoT datasets, BDCDC achieves exceptional performance, with 99.47-99.75% F1 scores for high-risk attacks (e.g., DDoS, MITM), near-zero false alarm rates (FAR < 0.005%), and 99.06% accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art methods. The framework reduces transaction latency by 2.1 x compared to traditional PoW and ensures GDPR/HIPAA compliance through decentralized, immutable audit trails. By harmonizing blockchain's tamper-proof transparency with deep learning's adaptive threat intelligence, BDCDC establishes a resilient, scalable defense against evolving cyber-physical threats in critical healthcare ecosystems. This work bridges the gap between theoretical security frameworks and practical deployment, offering a validated blueprint for safeguarding sensitive medical data in next-generation IoT infrastructures.

AB  - Background Artificial intelligence (AI) applications in medicines, pharmacotherapy, and pharmaceutical services are expanding, yet the lack of standardized reporting guidelines for scientific studies hinders transparency, comparability, and reproducibility in evidence-based healthcare decision-making. Aim To develop and validate comprehensive reporting guidelines for AI studies in these fields through expert consensus. Method Following the Guidance for Developers of Health Research Reporting Guidelines (Moher in PLoS Med, https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000217, 2010), this study was conducted between May and October 2024 in two phases. Phase 1 involved drafting the initial guidelines through literature reviews and structured expert discussions by an internal committee. Phase 2 employed the Delphi method for validation and refinement. Twenty-six experts from nine countries, representing clinical pharmacy, pharmaceutical services, computer science, and AI, participated in the first round, with 21 completing the second round. Items were included if they received a median >= 7 on a 9-point evaluation scale, with >= 75% agreement defining publication consensus. Results The final Medin AI guidelines comprise 14 items and 78 sub-items across four domains: core aspects, ethical considerations in medication and pharmacotherapy, medicines as products, and services related to medicines and pharmacotherapy. All items achieved consensus (median = 8, with 95.2% agreement on publication readiness). MedinAI's items adapt to different AI development stages, and its structure operates in parallel with EQUATOR Network reporting guidelines for most study designs (CONSORT, STROBE, PRISMA, SPIRIT, etc.), ensuring versatility. Conclusion MedinAI provides validated reporting guidelines for AI studies in medicines, pharmacotherapy and pharmaceutical services, promoting transparency, comparability, reproducibility, responsible and ethical AI development for these fields.

AB  - This paper examines the rise of clinical decision support algorithms used to assess risk in pain management and the opioid industry's influence on their development and implementation. To understand this influence, we conducted a qualitative study of documents related to the development of a tool that relied on artificial intelligence (AI) to suggest modifications in opioid prescribing, called NarxCare. The study began with keyword searches of the Opioid Industry Document Archive (OIDA), which contained over 3 million documents at the time of the study, to examine the pharmaceutical industry's role in shaping the digital transformation of opioid prescribing. Our findings highlight industry-driven investments, educational campaigns, corporate policy activities, and the reliance on proprietary data that facilitated the widespread implementation of NarxCare. The increasing reliance on NarxCare raises concerns about its limited transparency, unknown reliability, and potential bias which may disproportionately affect certain patient groups based on race, socioeconomic status, or health conditions. This paper argues that the promotion of technologies like NarxCare allows the pharmaceutical industry to reinforce the narrative that opioids can be effective when prescribed responsibly, using advanced, data-driven strategies. Marketed as tools that assist clinicians in making more informed prescribing decisions, NarxCare contributes to the portrayal of the industry as a responsible actor in the regulation and distribution of opioids. Shifting attention to individual risk factors rather than systemic challenges enables the pharmaceutical industry to sidestep its role in the opioid crisis and evade scrutiny for its influence over regulation, the sponsorship of education and research, lobbying, supply chain control, and public health narratives. While NarxCare aims to improve prescribing safety, it requires critical evaluation in terms of effectiveness, ethical considerations, and the continued influence of the pharmaceutical industry in its design and implementation.

AB  - With the development of intelligent medicine, lesion detection supported by Internet of Things (IoT), big data, and deep learning has become a hotspot. However, lesion detection technology based on deep learning requires huge amounts of high-quality medical image data, and the data from social IoT has the problems of uneven quality and lack of lesion labeling. Current studies usually ignore the unstable quality of IoT data and the interpretability of diagnostic results, resulting in deeper model layers, larger models, poor real-time performance, and lack of persuasion. To address the problems, this article first proposes a core data extraction method for multi-class lesion detection based on unlabeled medical image from social IoT. Then, we propose an ensemble algorithm based on lightweight models to improve the detection accuracy. Finally, we visualize pathological features to enhance the interpretability of core data and detection results.

AB  - The stress factor has been considered as a primary cause that affects a variety of human health conditions nowadays. Medical studies indicate that long-term stress can result in behavioral and cardiovascular problems directly or indirectly. Many individuals still disregard their signs of stress and do not take appropriate steps before severe physiological and emotional issues arise. In several types of research, the physiological signal obtained by heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) monitoring is used for the assessment of mental stress, and this can be suggested to inform an individual about her (his) state of mind due to its non-invasiveness. Therefore this paper proposes an Artificial Intelligence-based fuzzy assisted Petri net (AI-FAS) method for stress assessment on HR and BP monitoring. The normal HR can be determined by the interval between two successive QRS complexes in the ECG waveform. However, acknowledgment of ECG patterns faces problems because of pathological response and noise caused by time-variant physiology. The variance of the heart rate is measured with the analysis of time and frequency. Fuzzy assisted Petri nets in evaluating the stress assessment for HR. BP monitoring for stress management is achieved by the transient time of each pulse. The strength of fuzzy systems indicates interpretability versus the accuracy of two different requirements. Furthermore, the findings indicate that the performance rate of 93.55%, precision 89.01%, recall 89.50%, adaption 89.901% has been numerically validated in stress management.

AB  - This scoping review examined racial and ethnic bias in artificial intelligence health algorithms (AIHA), the role of stakeholders in oversight, and the consequences of AIHA for health equity. Using the PRISMA-ScR guidelines, databases were searched between 2020 and 2024 using the terms racial and ethnic bias in health algorithms resulting in a final sample of 23 sources. Suggestions for how to mitigate algorithmic bias were compiled and evaluated, roles played by stakeholders were identified, and governance and stewardship plans for AIHA were examined. While AIHA represent a significant breakthrough in predictive analytics and treatment optimization, regularly outperforming humans in diagnostic precision and accuracy, they also present serious challenges to patient privacy, data security, institutional transparency, and health equity. Evidence from extant sources including those in this review showed that AIHA carry the potential to perpetuate health inequities. While the current study considered AIHA in the US, the use of AIHA carries implications for global health equity.

AB  - The success of Machine Learning (ML) models in healthcare relies heavily on the quality of data used. High-quality data are crucial for improving the predictive capabilities and the overall performance of ML systems. Despite this, research on data quality in healthcare and ML remains limited, with varying definitions of issues and dimensions across contexts. This study introduces a structured, expert-driven framework for prioritizing data quality dimensions critical to ML performance in healthcare. In contrast to performance evaluation studies involving machine learning algorithms or classifiers, this research does not encompass the training or comparison of predictive models. It addresses a key gap in ML data control by integrating ISO/IEC 25012 with Priestley's classification and using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to evaluate 15 dimensions based on expert judgment. The findings identify Completeness (21.25%), Accuracy (15.53%), Consistency (14.31%), Currentness (14.82%), and Precision (13.82%) as the most influential dimensions for ML healthcare outcomes. A One-at-a-Time (OAT) sensitivity analysis with +/- 17.6% perturbation confirms the robustness of prioritization despite expert input variability. Key contributions include: 1) a tailored framework for ML healthcare data; 2) AHP-based dimension prioritization; 3) validation through sensitivity testing; 4) insights into data quality's impact on ML fairness and transparency; and 5) practical guidance for data governance and resource allocation. Future work will apply this framework to clinical datasets to validate its effectiveness in enhancing ML model performance and generalizability.

AB  - Traditional image-based survival prediction models rely on discriminative patch labeling which make those methods not scalable to extend to large datasets. Recent studies have shown Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) framework is useful for histopathological images when no annotations are available in classification task. Different to the current image-based survival models that limit to key patches or clusters derived from Whole Slide Images (WSIs), we propose Deep Attention Multiple Instance Survival Learning (DeepAttnMISL) by introducing both siamese MI-FCN and attention-based MIL pooling to efficiently learn imaging features from the WSI and then aggregate WSI-level information to patient-level. Attention-based aggregation is more flexible and adaptive than aggregation techniques in recent survival models. We evaluated our methods on two large cancer whole slide images datasets and our results suggest that the proposed approach is more effective and suitable for large datasets and has better interpretability in locating important patterns and features that contribute to accurate cancer survival predictions. The proposed framework can also be used to assess individual patient's risk and thus assisting in delivering personalized medicine. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite the large-scale adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models in healthcare, there is an urgent need for trustworthy tools to rigorously backtrack the model decisions so that they behave reliably. Counterfactual explanations take a counter-intuitive approach to allow users to explore "what if" scenarios gradually becoming popular in the trustworthy field. However, most previous work on model's counterfactual explanation cannot generate in-distribution attribution credibly, produces adversarial examples, or fails to give a confidence interval for the explanation. Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel approach that generates counterfactuals in locally smooth directed semantic embedding space, and at the same time gives an uncertainty estimate in the counterfactual generation process. Specifically, we identify low-dimensional directed semantic embedding space based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) applied in differential generative model. Then, we propose latent space smoothing regularization to rectify counterfactual search within in-distribution, such that visually-imperceptible changes are more robust to adversarial perturbations. Moreover, we put forth an uncertainty estimation framework for evaluating counterfactual uncertainty. Extensive experiments on several challenging realistic Chest X-ray and CelebA datasets show that our approach performs consistently well and better than the existing several state-of-the-art baseline approaches.

AB  - This paper explores the convergence of Human-Centered AI (HCAI) and Cyber-Physical Social Systems (CPSS) in pursuing advanced Cognitive Situation Awareness (CSA). Integrating HCAI principles within CPSS fosters systems prioritizing human needs, values, and experiences, improving perception, understanding, and responsiveness to complex environments. By incorporating transparency, interpretability, and usability into Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, the human-centered approach enhances user interaction and cooperation with intelligent systems, leading to more adaptive and efficient CPSS. The study employs a comprehensive approach to explore the intersection of HCAI and CPSS. Moreover, the paper presents case studies to illustrate real-world applications of HCAI and CPSS, such as self-driving cars and smart homes, transportation, healthcare, energy management, social media, and emergency response systems. Nevertheless, technical complexities, privacy concerns, and regulatory considerations must be addressed. The paper demonstrates the practical implications of integrating HCAI into CPSS through case studies in various domains. Furthermore, It highlights the positive impact of CSA systems such as self-driving cars, showcasing improvements in transportation. This paper contributes to advancing CSA and designing intelligent systems, promoting human-machine collaboration and societal well-being. By examining the intersection of HCAI and CPSS, this study advances research in CSA and designing intelligent systems prioritizing human needs, values, and experiences.

AB  - PurposeCurrent radiomic approaches inadequately resolve spatial intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), limiting neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy (NACI) response prediction. We propose an interpretable multimodal framework to: (1) quantitatively map intra-/peritumoral heterogeneity via voxel-wise habitat radiomics; (2) model cross-sectional tumor biology using 2.5D deep learning; and (3) establish mechanism-driven biomarkers via SHAP interpretability to identify resistance-linked subregions. MethodsThis dual-center retrospective study analyzed 269 treatment-na & iuml;ve ESCC patients with baseline PET/CT (training: n = 144; validation: n = 62; test: n = 63). Habitat radiomics delineated tumor subregions via K-means clustering (Calinski-Harabasz-optimized) on PET/CT, extracting 1,834 radiomic features per modality. A multi-stage pipeline (univariate filtering, mRMR, LASSO regression) selected 32 discriminative features. The 2.5D model aggregated +/- 4 peri-tumoral slices, fusing PET/CT via MixUp channels using a fine-tuned ResNet50 (ImageNet-pretrained), with multi-instance learning (MIL) translating slice-level features to patient-level predictions. Habitat features, MIL signatures, and clinical variables were integrated via five-classifier ensemble (ExtraTrees/SVM/RandomForest) and Crossformer architecture (SMOTE-balanced). Validation included AUC, sensitivity, specificity, calibration curves, decision curve analysis (DCA), survival metrics (C-index, Kaplan-Meier), and interpretability (SHAP, Grad-CAM). ResultsHabitat radiomics achieved superior validation AUC (0.865, 95% CI: 0.778-0.953), outperforming conventional radiomics (Delta AUC + 3.6%, P < 0.01) and clinical models (Delta AUC + 6.4%, P < 0.001). SHAP identified the invasive front (H2) as dominant predictor (40% of top features), with wavelet_LHH_firstorder_Entropy showing highest impact (SHAP = + 0.42). The 2.5D MIL model demonstrated strong generalizability (validation AUC: 0.861). The combined model achieved state-of-the-art test performance (AUC = 0.824, sensitivity = 0.875) with superior calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow P > 0.800), effective survival stratification (test C-index: 0.809), and 23-41% net benefit improvement in DCA. Conclusion Integrating habitat radiomics and 2.5D deep learning enables interpretable dual diagnostic-prognostic stratification in ESCC, advancing precision oncology by decoding spatial heterogeneity.

AB  - By using omics, we can now examine all components of biological systems simultaneously. Deep learning-based drug prediction methods have shown promise by integrating cancer-related multi-omics data. However, the complex interaction between genes poses challenges in accurately projecting multi-omics data. In this research, we present a predictive model for drug response that incorporates diverse types of omics data, comprising genetic mutation, copy number variation, methylation, and gene expression data. This study proposes latent alignment for information mismatch in integration, which is achieved through an attention module capturing interactions among diverse types of omics data. The latent alignment and attention modules significantly improve predictions, outperforming the baseline model, with MSE = 1.1333, F1-score = 0.5342, and AUROC = 0.5776. High accuracy was achieved in predicting drug responses for piplartine and tenovin-6, while the accuracy was comparatively lower for mitomycin-C and obatoclax. The latent alignment module exclusively outperforms the baseline model, enhancing the MSE by 0.2375, the F1-score by 4.84%, and the AUROC by 6.1%. Similarly, the attention module only improves these metrics by 0.1899, 2.88%, and 2.84%, respectively. In the interpretability case study, panobinostat exhibited the most effective predicted response, with a value of -4.895. We provide reliable insights for drug selection in personalized medicine by identifying crucial genetic factors influencing drug response.

AB  - Occupational health monitoring in demolition environments requires precise detection of blast-dust-induced pulmonary pathologies. However, it is often hindered by challenges such as contaminated imaging biomarkers, limited access to medical resources in mining areas, and opaque AI-based diagnostic models. This study presents a novel computational framework that combines industrial-grade robustness with clinical interpretability for the diagnosis of pulmonary nodules. We propose a hybrid framework that integrates morphological purification techniques (multi-step filling and convex hull operations) with multi-dimensional features fusion (radiomics + lightweight deep features). To enhance computational efficiency and interpretability, we design a soft voting ensemble classifier, eliminating the need for complex deep learning architectures. On the LIDC-IDRI dataset, our model achieved an AUC of 0.99 and an accuracy of 0.97 using standard clinical-grade hardware, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods while requiring fewer computational resources. Ablation studies, feature weight maps, and normalized mutual information heatmaps confirm the robustness and interpretability of the model, while uncertainty quantification metrics such as the Brier score and Expected Calibration Error (ECE) better validate the model's clinical applicability and prediction stability. This approach effectively achieves resource-accuracy co-optimization, maintaining low computational costs, and is highly suitable for resource-constrained clinical environments. The modular design of our framework also facilitates extensions to other medical imaging domains without the need for high-end infrastructure.

AB  - Generative artificial intelligence, including large language models (LLMs), holds immense potential to enhance healthcare, medical education, and health research. Recognizing the transformative opportunities and potential risks afforded by LLMs, the Association of Academic Radiology-Radiology Research Alliance convened a task force to explore the promise and pitfalls of using LLMs such as ChatGPT in radiology. This white paper explores the impact of LLMs on radiology education, highlighting their potential to enrich curriculum development, teaching and learning, and learner assessment. Despite these advantages, the implementation of LLMs presents challenges, including limits on accuracy and transparency, the risk of misinformation, data privacy issues, and potential biases, which must be carefully considered. We provide recommendations for the successful integration of LLMs and LLM-based educational tools into radiology education programs, emphasizing assessment of the technological readiness of LLMs for specific use cases, structured planning, regular evaluation, faculty development, increased training opportunities, academic-industry collaboration, and research on best practices for employing LLMs in education.

AB  - Chronic wounds affect the lives of millions of individuals globally, and due to substantial medical costs, treating chronic injuries is very challenging for the healthcare system. The classification of regular wound type is essential in wound care management and diagnosis since it can assist clinicians in deciding on the appropriate treatment method. Hence, an effective wound diagnostic tool would enable clinicians to classify the different types of chronic wounds in less time. The majority of the existing chronic wound classification methods are mainly focused on the binary classification of the wound types. A few approaches exist that classify chronic wounds into multiple classes, but these achieved lower performances for pressure and diabetic wound classification. Furthermore, cross-corpus evaluation is absent in chronic wound type classification, in order to better evaluate the efficacy of existing methods on real-time wound images. To address the limitations of the current studies, we propose a novel Swish-ELU EfficientNet-B4 (SEEN-B4) deep learning framework that can effectively identify and classify chronic wounds into multiple classes. Moreover, we also extend the existing Medetec and Advancing the Zenith of Healthcare (AZH) datasets to deal with the class imbalance problem of these datasets. Our proposed model is evaluated on publicly available AZH and Medetec datasets and their extended versions. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed SEEN-B4 model has attained an accuracy of 87.32%, 88.17%, 88%, and 89.34% on the AZH, Extended AZH, Medetec, and Extended Medetec datasets, respectively. We also show the effectiveness of our method against the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Furthermore, we evaluated the proposed model for the cross-corpora scenario to demonstrate the model generalization aptitude, and interpret the model's result through explainable AI techniques. The experimental results show the proposed model's effectiveness for classifying chronic wound types.

AB  - Vaccine acceptance is a crucial component of a viable immunization program in healthcare system, yet the disparities in new and existing vaccination adoption rates prevail across regions. Disparities in the rate of vaccine acceptance result in low immunization coverage and slow uptake of newly introduced vaccines. This research presents an innovative AI-driven predictive model, designed to accurately forecast vaccine acceptance within immunization programs, while providing high interpretability. Primarily, the contribution of this study is to classify vaccine acceptability into Low, Medium, Partial High, and High categories. Secondly, this study implements the Feature Importance method to make the model highly interpretable for healthcare providers. Thirdly, our findings highlight the impact of demographic and socio-demographic factors on vaccine acceptance, providing valuable insights for policymakers to improve immunization rates. A sample dataset containing 7150 data records with 31 demographic and socioeconomic attributes from PDHS (2017-2018) is used in this paper. Using the LightGBM algorithm, the proposed model constructed on the basis of different machine-learning procedures achieved 98% accuracy to accurately predict the acceptability of vaccines included in the immunization program. The association rules suggest that higher SES, region, parents' occupation, and mother's education have an association with vaccine acceptability.

AB  - Background Understanding women's perspectives can help to create an effective and acceptable artificial intelligence (AI) implementation for triaging mammograms, ensuring a high proportion of screening-detected cancer. This study aimed to explore Swedish women's perceptions and attitudes towards the use of AI in mammography. Method Semistructured interviews were conducted with 16 women recruited in the spring of 2023 at Capio S:t Gorans Hospital, Sweden, during an ongoing clinical trial of AI in screening (ScreenTrustCAD, NCT 04778670) with Philips equipment. The interview transcripts were analysed using inductive thematic content analysis. Results In general, women viewed AI as an excellent complementary tool to help radiologists in their decision-making, rather than a complete replacement of their expertise. To trust the AI, the women requested a thorough evaluation, transparency about AI usage in healthcare, and the involvement of a radiologist in the assessment. They would rather be more worried because of being called in more often for scans than risk having overlooked a sign of cancer. They expressed substantial trust in the healthcare system if the implementation of AI was to become a standard practice. Conclusion The findings suggest that the interviewed women, in general, hold a positive attitude towards the implementation of AI in mammography; nonetheless, they expect and demand more from an AI than a radiologist. Effective communication regarding the role and limitations of AI is crucial to ensure that patients understand the purpose and potential outcomes of AI-assisted healthcare.

AB  - Cancer is one of the leading causes of deaths worldwide. Survival analysis and prediction of cancer patients is of great significance for their precision medicine. The robustness and interpretability of the survival prediction models are important, where robustness tells whether a model has learned the knowledge, and interpretability means if a model can show human what it has learned. In this paper, we propose a robust and interpretable model SurvConvMixer, which uses pathways customized gene expression images and ConvMixer for cancer short-term, mid-term and long-term overall survival prediction. With ConvMixer, the representation of each pathway can be learned respectively. We show the robustness of our model by testing the trained model on absolutely untrained external datasets. The interpretability of SurvConvMixer depends on gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-Cam), by which we can obtain the pathway-level activation heat map. Then wilcoxon rank-sum tests are conducted to obtain the statistically significant pathways, thereby revealing which pathways the model focuses on more. SurvConvMixer achieves remarkable performance on the short-term, mid-term and long-term overall survival of lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma and skin cutaneous melanoma, and the external validation tests show that SurvConvMixer can generalize to external datasets so that it is robust. Finally, we investigate the activation maps generated by Grad-Cam, after wilcoxon rank-sum test and Kaplan-Meier estimation, we find that some survival-related pathways play important role in SurvConvMixer.

AB  - The increasing scientific attention given to precision medicine based on real-world data has led to many recent studies clarifying the relationships between treatment effects and patient characteristics. However, this is challenging because of ubiquitous heterogeneity in the treatment effect for individuals and the real-world data on their backgrounds being complex and noisy. Because of their flexibility, various machine learning (ML) methods have been proposed for estimating heterogeneous treatment effect (HTE). However, most ML methods incorporate black-box models that hamper direct interpretation of the relationships between an individual's characteristics and treatment effects. This study proposes an ML method for estimating HTE based on the rule ensemble method RuleFit. The main advantages of RuleFit are interpretability and accuracy. However, HTEs are always defined in the potential outcome framework, and RuleFit cannot be applied directly. Thus, we modified RuleFit and proposed a method to estimate HTEs that directly interpret the relationships among the individuals' features from the model. Actual data from an HIV study, the ACTG 175 dataset, was used to illustrate the interpretation based on the ensemble of rules created by the proposed method. The numerical results confirm that the proposed method has high prediction accuracy compared to previous methods, indicating that the proposed method establishes an interpretable model with sufficient prediction accuracy.

AB  - Background: Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Llama and Claude are transforming healthcare by interpreting complex text, extracting information, and providing guideline-based support. Radiology, with its high patient volume and digital workflows, is a ideal field for LLM integration.ObjectiveAssessment of the potential of LLMs to enhance efficiency, standardization, and decision support in radiology, while addressing ethical and regulatory challenges.
   Material and methods: Pilot studies at Freiburg and Basel university hospitals evaluated local LLM systems for tasks like prior report summarization and guideline-driven reporting. Integration with Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) and Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems was achieved via Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standards. Metrics included time savings, compliance with the European Union (EU) Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act, and user acceptance.
   Results: LLMs demonstrate significant potential as a support tool for radiologists in clinical practice by reducing reporting times, automating routine tasks, and ensuring consistent, high-quality results. They also support interdisciplinary workflows (e.g., tumor boards) and meet data protection requirements when locally implemented.
   Discussion: Local LLM systems are feasible and beneficial in radiology, enhancing efficiency and diagnostic quality. Future work should refine transparency, expand applications, and ensure LLMs complement medical expertise while adhering to ethical and legal standards.

AB  - This paper explores the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in lung cancer screening programs, particularly in the interpretation of computed tomography (CT) scans. The authors acknowledge the benefits of AI, including faster and potentially more accurate analysis of scans, but also raise concerns about clinician trust, transparency, and the deskilling of radiologists due to decreased scan exposure. The rise of AI in medicine and the introduction of national lung cancer screening programs are both increasing contemporarily and naturally the overlap and interplay between the two in the future is ensured. The paper highlights the importance of human-AI collaboration, emphasizing the need for interpretable models and ongoing validation through clinical trials. The promising results and problems uncovered the current pilot studies is explored. Building trust with patients and clinicians is also crucial, considering factors like disease risk perception and the human element of patient interaction. The authors conclude that while AI offers significant promise, widespread adoption hinges on addressing ethical considerations and ensuring a balanced, synergistic relationship between AI and medical professionals. This report aims to provide a talking point to inspire conversations around, and prepare clinicians for the rapidly approaching frontier that is AI in healthcare.

AB  - In recent years, deep learning (DL) systems are increasingly used in the safety-critical fields such as autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, and financial service. Although these systems have demonstrated an outstanding performance in enhancing the accuracy of decision-making, they pose significant challenges to the trustworthiness due to their limited interpretability and inherent uncertainty. Adaptive random testing (ART) has been proved as an effective approach for ensuring the reliability of DL systems. However, existing ART methods for DL systems incur a heavy overhead in test case selection due to the computation of distances. To address this issue, we propose a lightweight adaptive random testing (Lw-ARTDL) method for DL systems. In our improved algorithm, we employ the K-Means technique to divide the entire test suite into several subsets. Then, for a candidate test case, we only calculate distances between it and the test cases within the category to which it belongs. This partition strategy ensures that the selected test cases are more representative while significantly reducing the computational cost. To validate the proposed algorithm, the comparison experiments between Lw-ARTDL and the original ARTDL algorithm are conducted on two typical DL systems. The experimental results show that Lw-ARTDL significantly reduces the overhead of failure detection, and exhibits stronger failure detection capability compared to ARTDL in most similarity metrics.

AB  - BackgroundEarly detection of malnutrition in critically ill patients is crucial for timely intervention and improved clinical outcomes. However, identifying individuals at risk remains challenging due to the complexity and variability of patient conditions. This study aimed to develop and externally validate machine learning models for predicting malnutrition within 24 h of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, culminating in a web-based malnutrition prediction tool for clinical decision support.MethodsA total of 1006 critically ill adult patients (aged >= 18 years) were included in the model development group, and 300 adult patients comprised the external validation group. The development data were partitioned into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets. Hyperparameters were optimized via 5-fold cross-validation on the training set, eliminating the need for a separate validation set while ensuring internal validation. External validation was performed on an independent group to assess generalizability. Predictors were selected using random forest recursive feature elimination; seven machine learning models-Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), random forest, decision tree, support vector machine (SVM), Gaussian naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and logistic regression-were trained and evaluated for accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC), Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUC-PR). Model interpretability was analyzed using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to quantify feature contributions.ResultsIn the development phase, among 1006 patients, 34.0% had moderate malnutrition and 17.9% severe malnutrition. The XGBoost model achieved superior predictive accuracy with an accuracy of 0.90 (95% CI = 0.86-0.94), precision of 0.92 (95% CI = 0.88-0.95), recall of 0.92 (95% CI = 0.89-0.95), F1 score of 0.92 (95% CI = 0.89-0.95), AUC-ROC of 0.98 (95% CI = 0.96-0.99), and AUC-PR of 0.97 (95% CI = 0.95-0.99) on the testing set. External validation confirmed robust performance with an accuracy of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.70-0.79), precision of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.75-0.83), recall of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.70-0.79), F1 score of 0.74 (95% CI: 0.69-0.78), AUC-ROC of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.86-0.91), and AUC-PR of 0.77 (95% CI: 0.73-0.80).ConclusionsMachine learning models, particularly XGBoost, demonstrated promising performance in early malnutrition prediction in ICU settings. The resultant web-based tool offers valuable resource for clinical decision support.Trial registrationChinese Clinical Trial Registry ChiCTR2200058286 (https://www.chictr.org.cn/bin/project/edit? pid=248690).

TI  - Using model explanations to guide deep learning models towards consistent explanations for EHR data
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA  - English
AB  - It has been shown that identical deep learning (DL) architectures will produce distinct explanations when trained with different hyperparameters that are orthogonal to the task (e.g. random seed, training set order). In domains such as healthcare and finance, where transparency and explainability is paramount, this can be a significant barrier to DL adoption. In this study we present a further analysis of explanation (in)consistency on 6 tabular datasets/tasks, with a focus on Electronic Health Records data. We propose a novel deep learning ensemble architecture that trains its sub-models to produce consistent explanations, improving explanation consistency by as much as 315% (e.g. from 0.02433 to 0.1011 on MIMIC-IV), and on average by 124% (e.g. from 0.12282 to 0.4450 on the BCW dataset). We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed technique and discuss the implications our results have for both industrial applications of DL and explainability as well as future methodological work.

AB  - Ongoing research efforts have been examining how to utilize artificial intelligence technology to help healthcare consumers make sense of their clinical data, such as diagnostic radiology reports. How to promote the acceptance of such novel technology is a heated research topic. Recent studies highlight the importance of providing local explanations about AI prediction and model performance to help users determine whether to trust AI's predictions. Despite some efforts, limited empirical research has been conducted to quantitatively measure how AI explanations impact healthcare consumers' perceptions of using patient-facing, AI-powered healthcare systems. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of different AI explanations on people's perceptions of AI-powered healthcare system. In this work, we designed and deployed a large-scale experiment (N = 3,423) on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to evaluate the effects of AI explanations on people's perceptions in the context of comprehending radiology reports. We created four groups based on two factors-the extent of explanations for the prediction (High vs. Low Transparency) and the model performance (Good vs. Weak AI Model)-and randomly assigned participants to one of the four conditions. Participants were instructed to classify a radiology report as describing a normal or abnormal finding, followed by completing a post-study survey to indicate their perceptions of the AI tool. We found that revealing model performance information can promote people's trust and perceived usefulness of system outputs, while providing local explanations for the rationale of a prediction can promote understandability but not necessarily trust. We also found that when model performance is low, the more information the AI system discloses, the less people would trust the system. Lastly, whether human agrees with AI predictions or not and whether the AI prediction is correct or not could also influence the effect of AI explanations. We conclude this paper by discussing implications for designing AI systems for healthcare consumers to interpret diagnostic report.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmia linked to increased mortality and significant healthcare burden, especially in the elderly. Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) are crucial for stroke prevention in AF, offering benefits over traditional vitamin K antagonists. Despite scoring systems like HATCH and CHA2DS2-VASc, their predictive ability for mortality in AF patients is limited. This study aims to use machine learning to predict mortality within six months of hospital discharge in AF patients treated with DOACs. Methods: Using the MIMIC-IV database, data from 6431 AF patients were analyzed. Feature selection was done with the LASSO algorithm. Five machine learning models were built: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and AdaBoost, using 27 features. The top two models were tested on a separate dataset. SHAP values explained model predictions and feature importance. Results: The best model, LightGBM, achieved an AUC of 0.886, accuracy of 0.862, sensitivity of 0.913, and specificity of 0.859. SHAP values highlighted the importance of length of hospital stay, ICU duration, and comorbidities. The model's interpretability allows for identifying individual patient risk factors, applicable in clinical practice. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that machine learning models effectively predict mortality in AF patients treated with DOACs, potentially enhancing personalized patient care.

AB  - Over the last decades, clinical decision support systems have been gaining importance. They help clinicians to make effective use of the overload of available information to obtain correct diagnoses and appropriate treatments. However, their power often comes at the cost of a black box model which cannot be interpreted easily. This interpretability is of paramount importance in a medical setting with regard to trust and (legal) responsibility. In contrast, existing medical scoring systems are easy to understand and use, but they are often a simplified rule-of-thumb summary of previous medical experience rather than a well-founded system based on available data. Interval Coded Scoring (ICS) connects these two approaches, exploiting the power of sparse optimization to derive scoring systems from training data. The presented toolbox interface makes this theory easily applicable to both small and large datasets. It contains two possible problem formulations based on linear programming or elastic net. Both allow to construct a model for a binary classification problem and establish risk profiles that can be used for future diagnosis. All of this requires only a few lines of code. ICS differs from standard machine learning through its model consisting of interpretable main effects and interactions. Furthermore, insertion of expert knowledge is possible because the training can be semi-automatic. This allows end users to make a tradeoff between complexity and performance based on cross-validation results and expert knowledge. Additionally, the toolbox offers an accessible way to assess classification performance via accuracy and the ROC curve, whereas the calibration of the risk profile can be evaluated via a calibration curve. Finally, the colour-coded model visualization has particular appeal if one wants to apply ICS manually on new observations, as well as for validation by experts in the specific application domains. The validity and applicability of the toolbox is demonstrated by comparing it to standard Machine Learning approaches such as Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines for several reallife datasets. These case studies on medical problems show its applicability as a decision support system. ICS performs similarly in terms of classification and calibration. Its slightly lower performance is countered by its model simplicity which makes it the method of choice if interpretability is a key issue.

TI  - COVID-Net Biochem: an explainability-driven framework to building machine learning models for predicting survival and kidney injury of COVID-19 patients from clinical and biochemistry data
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA  - English
AB  - Since the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic in 2020, the global community has faced ongoing challenges in controlling and mitigating the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as well as its evolving subvariants and recombinants. A significant challenge during the pandemic has not only been the accurate detection of positive cases but also the efficient prediction of risks associated with complications and patient survival probabilities. These tasks entail considerable clinical resource allocation and attention. In this study, we introduce COVID-Net Biochem, a versatile and explainable framework for constructing machine learning models. We apply this framework to predict COVID-19 patient survival and the likelihood of developing Acute Kidney Injury during hospitalization, utilizing clinical and biochemical data in a transparent, systematic approach. The proposed approach advances machine learning model design by seamlessly integrating domain expertise with explainability tools, enabling model decisions to be based on key biomarkers. This fosters a more transparent and interpretable decision-making process made by machines specifically for medical applications. More specifically, the framework comprises two phases: In the first phase, referred to as the "clinician-guided design" phase, the dataset is preprocessed using explainable AI and domain expert input. To better demonstrate this phase, we prepared a benchmark dataset of carefully curated clinical and biochemical markers based on clinician assessments for survival and kidney injury prediction in COVID-19 patients. This dataset was selected from a patient cohort of 1366 individuals at Stony Brook University. Moreover, we designed and trained a diverse collection of machine learning models, encompassing gradient-based boosting tree architectures and deep transformer architectures, specifically for survival and kidney injury prediction based on the selected markers. In the second phase, called the "explainability-driven design refinement" phase, the proposed framework employs explainability methods to not only gain a deeper understanding of each model's decision-making process but also to identify the overall impact of individual clinical and biochemical markers for bias identification. In this context, we used the models constructed in the previous phase for the prediction task and analyzed the explainability outcomes alongside a clinician with over 8 years of experience to gain a deeper understanding of the clinical validity of the decisions made. The explainability-driven insights obtained, in conjunction with the associated clinical feedback, are then utilized to guide and refine the training policies and architectural design iteratively. This process aims to enhance not only the prediction performance but also the clinical validity and trustworthiness of the final machine learning models. Employing the proposed explainability-driven framework, we attained 93.55% accuracy in survival prediction and 88.05% accuracy in predicting kidney injury complications. The models have been made available through an open-source platform. Although not a production-ready solution, this study aims to serve as a catalyst for clinical scientists, machine learning researchers, and citizen scientists to develop innovative and trustworthy clinical decision support solutions, ultimately assisting clinicians worldwide in managing pandemic outcomes.

AB  - In this study, we introduce two innovative hybrid models designed for predicting individual pharmacy costs: the Autoencoder-Gated Recurrent Unit (Auto-GRU) and the GoogLeNet-Residual Network (GR-Net). Utilizing data from high utilizers obtained through the Medicaid rebate program, these models aim to provide accurate predictions of total pharmacy costs for individual patients. Our approach involves rigorous data preprocessing, including the removal of missing values, and the fine-tuning of hyperparameters using the Adam optimizer. We systematically evaluate and compare the performance of these hybrid models with that of four individual models, Autoencoder (AE), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), GoogLeNet, and Residual Network (ResNet), using performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), training time, inference time and memory usage. Without correlation, Auto-GRU outperformed its individual models with an MSE value of 0.1675 versus GRU's MSE of 0.2806 and AE's MSE of 0.4086. GR-Net, without correlation, also beats the individual models with an MSE value of 0.0027 versus GoogLeNet's MSE value of 0.0106 and ResNet's MSE value of 0.0201. Similarly, with correlation, Auto-GRU outperformed its individual models with an MSE value of 0.2655 versus GRU's MSE of 0.4089 and AE's MSE of 0.4243. GR-Net, with correlation, also beats the individual models with an MSE value of 0.0097 versus GoogLeNet's MSE value of 0.0882 and ResNet's MSE value of 0.0106. Both the hybrid models outperformed the individual models in terms of MAE, MAE and RMSE both with and without correlation. Also, to interpret models prediction, we have implemented Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations, an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) technique. These findings highlight the robustness and effectiveness of the hybrid models in predicting pharmacy costs, underscoring their potential for integration into healthcare expense management systems.

AB  - Background: Asthma exerts a substantial burden on patients and health care systems. To facilitate preventive care for asthma management and improve patient outcomes, we recently developed two machine learning models, one on Intermountain Healthcare data and the other on Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) data, to forecast asthma-related hospital visits, including emergency department visits and hospitalizations, in the succeeding 12 months among patients with asthma. As is typical for machine learning approaches, these two models do not explain their forecasting results. To address the interpretability issue of black-box models, we designed an automatic method to offer rule format explanations for the forecasting results of any machine learning model on imbalanced tabular data and to suggest customized interventions with no accuracy loss. Our method worked well for explaining the forecasting results of our Intermountain Healthcare model, but its generalizability to other health care systems remains unknown.
   Objective: The objective of this study is to evaluate the generalizability of our automatic explanation method to KPSC for forecasting asthma-related hospital visits.
   Methods: Through a secondary analysis of 987,506 data instances from 2012 to 2017 at KPSC, we used our method to explain the forecasting results of our KPSC model and to suggest customized interventions. The patient cohort covered a random sample of 70% of patients with asthma who had a KPSC health plan for any period between 2015 and 2018.
   Results: Our method explained the forecasting results for 97.57% (2204/2259) of the patients with asthma who were correctly forecasted to undergo asthma-related hospital visits in the succeeding 12 months.
   Conclusions: For forecasting asthma-related hospital visits, our automatic explanation method exhibited an acceptable generalizability to KPSC.

AB  - Background and Aim: Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) has evolved over the years as an important tool for personalized medicine. Nevertheless, some limitations are associated with traditional TDM. Emerging data-driven model forecasting [e.g., through machine learning (ML)-based approaches] has been used for individualized therapy. This study proposes an interpretable stacking-based ML framework to predict concentrations in real time after olanzapine (OLZ) treatment.Methods: The TDM-OLZ dataset, consisting of 2,142 OLZ measurements and 472 features, was formed by collecting electronic health records during the TDM of 927 patients who had received OLZ treatment. We compared the performance of ML algorithms by using 10-fold cross-validation and the mean absolute error (MAE). The optimal subset of features was analyzed by a random forest-based sequential forward feature selection method in the context of the top five heterogeneous regressors as base models to develop a stacked ensemble regressor, which was then optimized via the grid search method. Its predictions were explained by using local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) and partial dependence plots (PDPs).Results: A state-of-the-art stacking ensemble learning framework that integrates optimized extra trees, XGBoost, random forest, bagging, and gradient-boosting regressors was developed for nine selected features [i.e., daily dose (OLZ), gender_male, age, valproic acid_yes, ALT, K, BW, MONO#, and time of blood sampling after first administration]. It outperformed other base regressors that were considered, with an MAE of 0.064, R-square value of 0.5355, mean squared error of 0.0089, mean relative error of 13%, and ideal rate (the percentages of predicted TDM within & PLUSMN; 30% of actual TDM) of 63.40%. Predictions at the individual level were illustrated by LIME plots, whereas the global interpretation of associations between features and outcomes was illustrated by PDPs.Conclusion: This study highlights the feasibility of the real-time estimation of drug concentrations by using stacking-based ML strategies without losing interpretability, thus facilitating model-informed precision dosing.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) detection through voice analysis faces two fundamental challenges: traditional machine learning methods lack clinical interpretability due to their correlational nature, while existing causal inference approaches struggle with the high-dimensional, complex relationships inherent in vocal biomarkers. We address these limitations by developing a causal inference framework that establishes interpretable relationships between vocal features and PD diagnosis. Our approach centers on estimating the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) of vocal frequency spread using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and backdoor adjustment, implemented through CatBoost for robust nonlinear modeling. To overcome data scarcity constraints, we introduce a Self-Attentive Quantile GAN (SAQ-GAN) that preserves empirical feature distributions through quantile-based transformation and self-attention mechanisms. The framework includes systematic preprocessing for causal validity and comprehensive refutation tests to validate causal assumptions. Experimental evaluation on the Oxford Parkinson's dataset demonstrates that our method achieves 95.03% precision and 97.84% AUC-ROC while providing clinically interpretable causal estimates (ATE = 0.1844, 95% CI: [0.0743, 0.2945]). Comparative analysis with state-of-the-art causal methods and extensive ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of combining synthetic data augmentation with principled causal inference for medical diagnosis.

TI  - Personalising intravenous to oral antibiotic switch decision making through fair interpretable machine learning
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
LA  - English
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and healthcare associated infections pose a significant threat globally. One key prevention strategy is to follow antimicrobial stewardship practices, in particular, to maximise targeted oral therapy and reduce the use of indwelling vascular devices for intravenous (IV) administration. Appreciating when an individual patient can switch from IV to oral antibiotic treatment is often non-trivial and not standardised. To tackle this problem we created a machine learning model to predict when a patient could switch based on routinely collected clinical parameters. 10,362 unique intensive care unit stays were extracted and two informative feature sets identified. Our best model achieved a mean AUROC of 0.80 (SD 0.01) on the hold-out set while not being biased to individuals protected characteristics. Interpretability methodologies were employed to create clinically useful visual explanations. In summary, our model provides individualised, fair, and interpretable predictions for when a patient could switch from IV-to-oral antibiotic treatment. Prospectively evaluation of safety and efficacy is needed before such technology can be applied clinically.
   The decision to switch patients from intravenous to oral antibiotic therapy is important for the individual and wider society. Here, authors show a machine learning model using routine clinical data can predict when a patient could switch.

AB  - The ongoing epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 is taking a substantial financial and health toll on people worldwide. Assessing the level and duration of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody (Nab) would provide key information for government to make sound healthcare policies. Assessed at 3-, 6-, 12-, and 18-month postdischarge, we described the temporal change of IgG levels in 450 individuals with moderate to critical COVID-19 infection. Moreover, a data imputation framework combined with a novel deep learning model was implemented to predict the long-term Nab and IgG levels in these patients. Demographic characteristics, inspection reports, and CT scans during hospitalization were used in this model. Interpretability of the model was further validated with Shapely Additive exPlanation (SHAP) and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (GradCAM). IgG levels peaked at 3 months and remained stable in 12 months postdischarge, followed by a significant decline in 18 months postdischarge. However, the Nab levels declined from 6 months postdischarge. By training on the cohort of 450 patients, our long-term antibody prediction (LTAP) model could predict long-term IgG levels with relatively high area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, which far exceeds the performance achievable by commonly used models. Several prognostic factors including FDP levels, the percentages of T cells, B cells and natural killer cells, older age, sex, underlying diseases, and so forth, served as important indicators for IgG prediction. Based on these top 15 prognostic factors identified in IgG prediction, a simplified LTAP model for Nab level prediction was established and achieved an AUC of 0.828, which was 8.9% higher than MLP and 6.6% higher than LSTM. The close correlation between IgG and Nab levels making it possible to predict long-term Nab levels based on the factors selected by our LTAP model. Furthermore, our model identified that coagulation disorders and excessive immune response, which indicate disease severity, are closely related to the production of IgG and Nab.

AB  - During times of crisis, like in healthcare emergencies or disruptions in logistics and supply chains, decision-makers encounter significant challenges in managing resources efficiently. This study proposes an approach combining different information types and advanced computer techniques to improve how we handle crises. By looking at data connected with blockchain technology, we aim to understand crises better and help people make smarter decisions. We use a special kind of computer model called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to guess what might happen during a crisis, like how many people might get sick or if there might be problems with getting supplies. Our model is right about 87% of the time. To understand why the computer makes these guesses, we use a method called SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), which is widely known. However, we notice that SHAP sometimes doesn't explain things well for the entire period we're looking at. So, we suggest some changes to the SHAP method to explain things better for smaller parts of time. These changes help the method explain things better for small bits of time, but it might not be as good at explaining everything overall. To ensure our idea works, we compare our computer model's guesses and explanations with those from other models that look at data differently. We show the good and bad parts of our method in different crises.

AB  - This research explores the use of gated recurrent units (GRUs) for automated brain tumor detection using MRI data. The GRU model captures sequential patterns and considers spatial information within individual MRI images and the temporal evolution of lesion characteristics. The proposed approach improves the accuracy of tumor detection using MRI images. The model's performance is benchmarked against conventional CNNs and other recurrent architectures. The research addresses interpretability concerns by employing attention mechanisms that highlight salient features contributing to the model's decisions. The proposed model attention-gated recurrent units (A-GRU) results show promising results, indicating that the proposed model surpasses the state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy and obtained 99.32% accuracy. Due to the high predictive capability of the proposed model, we recommend it for the effective diagnosis of Brain tumors in the E-healthcare system.

AB  - Outlier detection is critical for ensuring data integrity across various domains, from fraud detection in finance to anomaly identification in healthcare. Despite the importance of anomaly detection, most methods focus on performance, with interpretability remaining underexplored in unsupervised learning. Interpretability is essential in contexts where understanding why certain data points are classified as outliers is as important as the detection itself. This study introduces an interpretable approach to unsupervised outlier detection by combining normalizing flows and decision trees. Normalizing flows transform complex data distributions into simpler, tractable forms, allowing precise density estimation and the generation of pseudo-labels that differentiate inliers from outliers. These pseudo-labels are subsequently used to train a decision tree, offering both a structured decision- making process and interpretability in an unsupervised context, thereby addressing a key gap in the field. Our method was evaluated against 23 established outlier detection algorithms across 17 datasets using Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). The results showed that our approach ranked 4th in F1 Score, 6th in MCC, 3rd in Precision, and 19th in Recall. While it performed strongly on some datasets and less soon others, this variability is likely due to dataset-specific characteristics. Post- hoc statistical significance testing demonstrated that interpretability in unsupervised outlier detection can be achieved without significantly compromising performance, making it a valuable option for applications that require transparent and understandable anomaly detection.

AB  - In the recent pandemic, accurate and rapid testing of patients remained a critical task in the diagnosis and control of COVID-19 disease spread in the healthcare industry. Because of the sudden increase in cases, most countries have faced scarcity and a low rate of testing. Chest X-rays have been shown in the literature to be a potential source of testing for COVID-19 patients, but manually checking X-ray reports is time-consuming and error-prone. Considering these limitations and the advancements in data science, we proposed a Vision Transformer-based deep learning pipeline for COVID-19 detection from chest X-ray-based imaging. Due to the lack of large data sets, we collected data from three open-source data sets of chest X-ray images and aggregated them to form a 30 K image data set, which is the largest publicly available collection of chest X-ray images in this domain to our knowledge. Our proposed transformer model effectively differentiates COVID-19 from normal chest X-rays with an accuracy of 98% along with an AUC score of 99% in the binary classification task. It distinguishes COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia patient's X-rays with an accuracy of 92% and AUC score of 98% in the Multi-class classification task. For evaluation on our data set, we fine-tuned some of the widely used models in literature, namely, EfficientNetB0, InceptionV3, Resnet50, MobileNetV3, Xception, and DenseNet-121, as baselines. Our proposed transformer model outperformed them in terms of all metrics. In addition, a Grad-CAM based visualization is created which makes our approach interpretable by radiologists and can be used to monitor the progression of the disease in the affected lungs, assisting healthcare.

AB  - BackgroundIntegrating artificial intelligence (AI) into intensive care practices can enhance patient care by providing real-time predictions and aiding clinical decisions. However, biases in AI models can undermine diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts, particularly in visual representations of healthcare professionals. This work aims to examine the demographic representation of two AI text-to-image models, Midjourney and ChatGPT DALL-E 2, and assess their accuracy in depicting the demographic characteristics of intensivists. MethodsThis cross-sectional study, conducted from May to July 2024, used demographic data from the USA workforce report (2022) and intensive care trainees (2021) to compare real-world intensivist demographics with images generated by two AI models, Midjourney v6.0 and ChatGPT 4.0 DALL-E 2. A total of 1,400 images were generated across ICU subspecialties, with outcomes being the comparison of sex, race/ethnicity, and age representation in AI-generated images to the actual workforce demographics. ResultsThe AI models demonstrated noticeable biases when compared to the actual U.S. intensive care workforce data, notably overrepresenting White and young doctors. ChatGPT-DALL-E2 produced less female (17.3% vs 32.2%, p < 0.0001), more White (61% vs 55.1%, p = 0.002) and younger (53.3% vs 23.9%, p < 0.001) individuals. While Midjourney depicted more female (47.6% vs 32.2%, p < 0.001), more White (60.9% vs 55.1%, p = 0.003) and younger intensivist (49.3% vs 23.9%, p < 0.001). Substantial differences between the specialties within both models were observed. Finally when compared together, both models showed significant differences in the Portrayal of intensivists. ConclusionsSignificant biases in AI images of intensivists generated by ChatGPT DALL-E 2 and Midjourney reflect broader cultural issues, potentially perpetuating stereotypes of healthcare worker within the society. This study highlights the need for an approach that ensures fairness, accountability, transparency, and ethics in AI applications for healthcare.

KW  - DIAGNOSIS
AB  - Osteoporosis (OP), a systemic skeletal disease characterized by compromised bone strength and elevated fracture susceptibility, represents a growing global health challenge that necessitates early detection and accurate risk stratification. With the exponential growth of multidimensional biomedical data in OP research, feature selection has become an indispensable machine learning paradigm that improves model generalizability. At the same time, it preserves clinical interpretability and enhances predictive accuracy. This perspective article systematically reviews the transformative role of feature selection methodologies across 3 critical domains of OP investigation: (1) multi-omics biomarker identification, (2) diagnostic pattern recognition, and (3) fracture risk prognostication. In biomarker discovery, advanced feature selection algorithms systematically refine high-dimensional multi-omics datasets (genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic) to isolate key molecular signatures correlated with BMD trajectories and microarchitectural deterioration. For clinical diagnostics, these techniques enable efficient extraction of discriminative pattern from multimodal imaging data, including DXA, QCT, and emerging dental radiographic biomarkers. In prognostic modeling, strategic variable selection optimizes prognostic accuracy by integrating demographic, biochemical, and biomechanical predictors while mitigating overfitting in heterogeneous patient cohorts. Current challenges include heterogeneity in dataset quality and dimensionality, translational gaps between algorithmic outputs and clinical decision parameters, and limited reproducibility across diverse populations. Future directions should prioritize the development of adaptive feature selection frameworks capable of dynamic multi-omics data integration, coupled with hybrid intelligence systems that synergize machine-derived biomarkers with clinician expertise. Addressing these challenges requires coordinated interdisciplinary efforts to establish standardized validation protocols and create clinician-friendly decision support interfaces, ultimately bridging the gap between computational OP research and personalized patient care.
   Osteoporosis (OP) is a common disease that causes bones to become weak and more prone to fractures, especially in older adults. Traditional tools for diagnosing and predicting OP risk have limitations. This article highlights how machine learning-particularly feature selection approaches-is helping researchers identify the most important indicators of the disease, such as specific genes, proteins, and imaging features. These methods can enhance early diagnosis, pinpoint high-risk individuals, and support personalized treatment strategies. The article also discusses ongoing challenges, such as data quality and clinical usability, and explores how these technologies can be better integrated into routine healthcare.

AB  - COVID-19 is a highly contagious infectious disease that necessitates timely assessment and effective diagnosis, although it is no longer a health emergency. Most existing computer-aided diagnosis systems for COVID-19 can achieve high accuracy, but they show insufficient generalization performance and weak interpretability. To address these issues, we propose diagnostic report supervised contrastive learning (DRSCL), a model training strategy that incorporates textual information from medical reports into model pretraining and then only transfers the pretrained image encoder into model inference. Due to the issue of data recurrence in medical diagnosis reports, which is common in the medical domain and can cause nonconvergence of the pretraining stage of DRSCL, we improve the loss function calculation of contrastive learning by integrating an operation to merge identical text or image features. In addition, for the fine-tuning and inference stage of DRSCL, we design a hierarchical fine-tuning strategy to better evaluate the pretraining performance and importance of each module. In case study, we build a medical image-text pair dataset of lung diseases for pretraining, with samples collected from hospitals in East China, and then conduct the fine-tuning and inference operation of DRSCL with a publicly available SARS-CoV-2 dataset. The comparative experimental results show that DRSCL helps all involved image encoders obtain better classification accuracy and superior generalization performance in the given COVID-19related diagnostic application. This finding indicates that DRSCL enhances deep models to learn more deep information with supervision of medical textual information. Furthermore, we adopt the Grad-CAM method to visualize pretrained models, and the results demonstrate that the DRSCL strategy is advantageous for improving model interpretability.

TI  - Implementation challenges of artificial intelligence (AI) in primary care: Perspectives of general practitioners in London UK
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Introduction Implementing artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare, particularly in primary care settings, raises crucial questions about practical challenges and opportunities. This study aimed to explore the perspectives of general practitioners (GPs) on the impact of AI in primary care.Methods A convenience sampling method was employed, involving a hybrid workshop with 12 GPs and 4 GP registrars. Verbal consent was obtained, and the workshop was audio recorded. Thematic analysis was conducted on the recorded data and contemporaneous notes to identify key themes.Results The workshop took place in 2023 and included 16 GPs aged 30 to 72 of diverse backgrounds and expertise. Most (93%) were female, and five (31%) self-identified as ethnic minorities. Thematic analysis identified two key themes related to AI in primary care: the potential benefits (such as help with diagnosis and risk assessment) and the associated concerns and challenges. Sub-themes included anxieties about diagnostic accuracy, AI errors, industry influence, and overcoming integration resistance. GPs also worried about increased workload, particularly extra, unnecessary patient tests, the lack of evidence base for AI programmes or accountability of AI systems and appropriateness of AI algorithms for different population groups. Participants emphasised the importance of transparency, trust-building, and research rigour to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of AI systems in healthcare.Conclusion The findings suggest that GPs recognise the potential of AI in primary care but raise important concerns regarding evidence base, accountability, bias and workload. The participants emphasised the need for rigorous evaluation of AI technologies. Further research and collaboration between healthcare professionals, policymakers, and technology organisations are essential to navigating these challenges and harnessing the full potential of AI.

AB  - Postoperative complications are still hard to predict despite the efforts towards the creation of clinical risk scores. The published scores contribute for the creation of specialized tools, but with limited predictive performance and reusability for implementation in the oncological context. This work aims to predict postoperative complications risk for cancer patients, offering two major contributions. First, to develop and evaluate a machine learning-based risk score, specific for the Portuguese population using a retrospective cohort of 847 cancer patients undergoing surgery between 2016 and 2018, for 4 outcomes of interest: (1) existence of postoperative complications, (2) severity level of complications, (3) number of days in the Intermediate Care Unit (ICU), and (4) postoperative mortality within 1 year. An additional cohort of 137 cancer patients from the same center was used for validation. Second, to improve the interpretability of the predictive models. In order to achieve these objectives, we propose an approach for the learning of risk predictors, offering new perspectives and insights into the clinical decision process. For postoperative complications the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) was 0.69, for complications' severity AUC was 0.65, for the days in the ICU the mean absolute error was 1.07 days, and for 1-year postoperative mortality the AUC was 0.74, calculated on the development cohort. In this study, predictive models which could help to guide physicians at organizational and clinical decision making were developed. Additionally, a web-based decision support tool is further provided to this end.

AB  - The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) technology's fast advancements aided smart healthcare systems to a larger extent. IoMT devices, on the other hand, rely on centralized processing and storage systems because of their limited computational and storage capacity. The reliance is susceptible to a single point of failure (SPoF) and erodes the user control over their medical data. In addition, Cloud models result in communication delays, which slow down the system's overall reaction time. To overcome these issues a decentralized distributed smart healthcare system is proposed that eliminates the SPoF and third-party control over healthcare data. Additionally, the proposed Fortified-Chain 2.0 uses a blockchain-based selective sharing mechanism with a mutual authentication technique to solve the issues, such as data privacy, security, and trust management in decentralized peer-to-peer healthcare systems. Also, we suggested a hybrid computing paradigm to deal with latency, computational, and storage constraints. A novel distributed machine learning (ML) module named random forest support vector machine (RFSVM) also embedded into the Fortified-Chain 2.0 system to automate patient health monitoring. In the RFSVM module, a random forest (RF) is used to select an optimal set of features from patients data in real-time environment and also support vector machine (SVM) is used to perform the decision making tasks. The proposed Fortified-Chain 2.0 works on a private blockchain-based distributed decentralised storage system (DDSS) that improves the system-level transparency, integrity, and traceability. Fortified-Chain 2.0 outperformed the existing Fortified-Chain in terms of low latency, high throughput, and availability with the help of a mutual authentication method.

AB  - Managing debt collections can be a challenging task. Managing the collection process and customer details requires human effort and time. We built a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based recommendation system to optimize this collection process. The model has to generate suggestions for boosting the collection rate, thereby saving time for manual tasks. The suitable actions were developed according to customers' risk levels and debt collector performance. The reinforcement Learning algorithm works based on the principle of exploration and exploitation. Initially, the model generates the recommendations based on the fixed policies for observed cases. When the model encounters a new scenario during the explorations, it has to create the recommendations by itself. It is necessary to understand why the model generated the particular recommendation. To build such an explainable recommendation system, we used Google Vertex Artificial Intelligence (AI) to generate text-based explanations for decisions made by the model. Moreover, we compared the different large language models through different prompting methods. We used prompt engineering concepts to get the desired text explanations. Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) and Recall Oriented Understudy For Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) were the accuracy metrics used in this work to analyze the performance of the text generation. Our contribution not only advances interpretability in the debt collection process but can also be implemented in various real-world settings such as healthcare, e-commerce recommendations, etc. The proposed method achieved a higher collection rate in three risk categories, such as very low risk, low risk, and medium risk.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is producing highly beneficial impacts in many domains, from transport to healthcare, from energy distribution to marketing, but it also raises concerns about undesirable ethical and social consequences. AI impact assessments (AI-IAs) are a way of identifying positive and negative impacts early on to safeguard AI's benefits and avoid its downsides. This article describes the first systematic review of these AI-IAs. Working with a population of 181 documents, the authors identified 38 actual AI-IAs and subjected them to a rigorous qualitative analysis with regard to their purpose, scope, organisational context, expected issues, timeframe, process and methods, transparency and challenges. The review demonstrates some convergence between AI-IAs. It also shows that the field is not yet at the point of full agreement on content, structure and implementation. The article suggests that AI-IAs are best understood as means to stimulate reflection and discussion concerning the social and ethical consequences of AI ecosystems. Based on the analysis of existing AI-IAs, the authors describe a baseline process of implementing AI-IAs that can be implemented by AI developers and vendors and that can be used as a critical yardstick by regulators and external observers to evaluate organisations' approaches to AI.

AB  - IntroductionTobacco use during pregnancy is a significant public health concern, associated with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Despite its critical importance, comprehensive data on tobacco use among pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa is limited. Leveraging machine learning approaches allows us to better understand these constraints and predict tobacco use among pregnant women, providing actionable insights for policy and intervention.ObjectiveThis study aimed to predict tobacco use and identify its determinants among pregnant women in 26 SSA countries using machine learning algorithm.MethodsUsing data from the Demographic and Health Surveys (2016-2023) across 26 SSA countries, we analyzed responses from 33,705 pregnant women. The Random Forest classifier, complemented by SHAP for feature interpretability, was employed for prediction and analysis. Data preprocessing included K-nearest neighbor imputation for missing values, SMOTE for handling class imbalance, and Recursive Feature Elimination for feature selection. Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC.ResultsThe Random Forest model demonstrated robust performance, achieving an AUC-ROC of 98%, recall of 94%, and F1 score of 93%. Key predictors identified included maternal literacy, maternal education, wealth index, distance to healthcare facilities, and place of residence. Pregnant women with lower educational attainment, residing in rural areas, and from lower wealth quintiles were more likely to use tobacco.Conclusion and recommendationsThis study utilized a Random Forest machine learning algorithm to identify key predictors of tobacco use among pregnant women across 26 Sub-Saharan African countries. Significant factors included maternal literacy, education, wealth index, and healthcare access, highlighting systemic inequities contributing to tobacco dependency during pregnancy. These findings advocate for policies addressing educational disparities, economic inequalities, and barriers to healthcare access to reduce tobacco use and improve maternal and neonatal outcomes. Future research should incorporate longitudinal data to enhance predictive accuracy and inform policy development.

AB  - Introduction: The research of auxiliary diagnosis has always been one of the hotspots in the world. The implementation of auxiliary diagnosis support algorithm for medical text data faces challenges with interpretability and creditability. The improvement of clinical diagnostic techniques means not only the improvement of diagnostic accuracy but also the further study of diagnostic basis. Traditional research methods for diagnostic markers often require a large amount of time and economic costs. Research objects are often dozens of samples, and it is, therefore, difficult to synthesize large amounts of data. Therefore, the comprehensiveness and reliability of traditional methods have yet to be improved. Therefore, the establishment of a model that can automatically diagnose diseases and automatically provide a diagnostic basis at the same time has a positive effect on the improvement of medical diagnostic techniques.
   Methods: Here, we established an auxiliary diagnostic tool based on attention deep learning algorithm to diagnostic hyperlipemia and automatically predict the corresponding diagnostic markers using hematological parameters. In this paper, we not only demonstrated the ability of the proposed model to automatically diagnose diseases using text-based medical data, such as physiological parameters, but also demonstrated its ability to forecast disease diagnostic markers. Human physiological parameters are used as input to the model, and the doctor's diagnosis results as an output. Through the attention layer, the degree of attention of the model to different physiological parameters can be obtained, that is, the model provides a diagnostic basis.
   Results: It achieved 94% ACC, 97.48% AUC, 96% sensitivity and 92% specificity with the test dataset. All the above samples are drawn from clinical practice. Moreover, the model predicted the diagnostic markers of hyperlipidemia by the attention mechanism, and the results were fully agreeable to the golden criteria.
   Discussion: The auxiliary diagnosis system proposed in this paper not only achieves the accurate and robust performance, and can be used for the preliminary diagnosis of patients, but also showing its great potential to discover new diagnostic markers. Therefore, it not only can improve the efficiency of clinical diagnosis but also shorten the research period of researching a diagnosis basis to an extent. It has a positive significance to the development of the medical diagnosis level.

AB  - Fetal health holds paramount importance in prenatal care and obstetrics, as it directly impacts the wellbeing of mother and fetus. Monitoring fetal health through pregnancy is crucial for identifying and addressing potential risks and complications that may arise. Early detection of abnormalities and deviations in fetal health can facilitate timely interventions to mitigate risks and improve outcomes for the mother and fetus. Monitoring fetal health also provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of prenatal interventions and treatments. For fetal health classification, this research work makes use of cardiotocography (CTG) data containing 21 features including fetal growth, development, and physiological parameters such as heart rate and movement patterns with three target classes "normal," "suspect," and "pathological." The proposed methodology makes use of data upsampled using the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) to handle the class imbalance problem that is very crucial in medical diagnosing with a light gradient boosting machine. The results show that the proposed model gives 0.9989 accuracy, 0.9988 area under the curve, 0.9832 recall, 0.9834 precision, 0.9832 F1 score, 0.9748 Kappa score, and 0.9749 Matthews correlation coefficient value on the test dataset. The performance of the proposed model is compared with other machine learning models to show the dominance of the proposed model. The proposed model's significance is further evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation and comparing the proposed model with other state-of-the-art models.

AB  - Background: Asthma is a major chronic disease that poses a heavy burden on health care. To facilitate the allocation of care management resources aimed at improving outcomes for high-risk patients with asthma, we recently built a machine learning model to predict asthma hospital visits in the subsequent year in patients with asthma Our model is more accurate than previous models. However, like most machine learning models, it offers no explanation of its prediction results. This creates a barrier for use in care management, where interpretability is desired.
   Objective: This study aims to develop a method to automatically explain the prediction results of the model and recommend tailored interventions without lowering the performance measures of the model.
   Methods: Our data were imbalanced, with only a small portion of data instances linking to future asthma hospital visits. To handle imbalanced data, we extended our previous method of automatically offering rule-formed explanations for the prediction results of any machine learning model on tabular data without lowering the model's performance measures. In a secondary analysis of the 334,564 data instances from Intermountain Healthcare between 2005 and 2018 used to form our model, we employed the extended method to automatically explain the prediction results of our model and recommend tailored interventions. The patient cohort consisted of all patients with asthma who received care at Intermountain Healthcare between 2005 and 2018, and resided in Utah or Idaho as recorded at the visit.
   Results: Our method explained the prediction results for 89.7% (391/436) of the patients with asthma who, per our model's correct prediction, were likely to incur asthma hospital visits in the subsequent year.
   Conclusions: This study is the first to demonstrate the feasibility of automatically offering rule-formed explanations for the prediction results of any machine learning model on imbalanced tabular data without lowering the performance measures of the model. After further improvement, our asthma outcome prediction model coupled with the automatic explanation function could be used by clinicians to guide the allocation of limited asthma care management resources and the identification of appropriate interventions.

AB  - Author summaryGenetic variants can impact the function of voltage-gated ion channels, which are transmembrane channels that are important for the electrical signalling of neurons. Individuals affected by these variants may have severe neurological or cardiac disease. Knowing the functional effects of variants can help us improve the diagnosis and clinical care for these individuals, and may also enable precision medicine aimed at correcting channel function. Machine learning methods are capable of predicting these functional effects, but previous models have only included information from protein sequence and structure. Here, we have developed a novel algorithm that can integrate clinical information by using the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), a standardized vocabulary of phenotypic features encountered in human disease. These different sources of information are used to train a multi-kernel support-vector machine. Our results suggest that this model is robust, interpretable, and more accurate than previous methods. Variant functional effect prediction engines will be useful tools for clinical geneticists, neurologists and biophysicists.
   Missense variants in genes encoding ion channels are associated with a spectrum of severe diseases. Variant effects on biophysical function correlate with clinical features and can be categorized as gain- or loss-of-function. This information enables a timely diagnosis, facilitates precision therapy, and guides prognosis. Functional characterization presents a bottleneck in translational medicine. Machine learning models may be able to rapidly generate supporting evidence by predicting variant functional effects. Here, we describe a multi-task multi-kernel learning framework capable of harmonizing functional results and structural information with clinical phenotypes. This novel approach extends the human phenotype ontology towards kernel-based supervised machine learning. Our gain- or loss-of-function classifier achieves high performance (mean accuracy 0.853 SD 0.016, mean AU-ROC 0.912 SD 0.025), outperforming both conventional baseline and state-of-the-art methods. Performance is robust across different phenotypic similarity measures and largely insensitive to phenotypic noise or sparsity. Localized multi-kernel learning offered biological insight and interpretability by highlighting channels with implicit genotype-phenotype correlations or latent task similarity for downstream analysis.

AB  - This study presents an approach based on machine learning (ML) techniques to analyze the relationship between emergency room (ER) admissions for cardiorespiratory diseases (CRDs) and environmental factors. The aim of this study is the development and verification of an interpretable machine learning framework applied to environmental and health data to assess the relationship between environmental factors and daily emergency room admissions for cardiorespiratory diseases. The model's predictive accuracy was evaluated by comparing simulated values with observed historical data, thereby identifying the most influential environmental variables and critical exposure thresholds. This approach supports public health surveillance and healthcare resource management optimization. The health and environmental data, collected through meteorological sensors and air quality monitoring stations, cover eleven years (2013-2023), including meteorological conditions and atmospheric pollutants. Four ML models were compared, with XGBoost showing the best predictive performance (R-2 = 0.901; MAE = 0.047). A 10-fold cross-validation was applied to improve reliability. Global model interpretability was assessed using SHAP, which highlighted that high levels of carbon monoxide and relative humidity, low atmospheric pressure, and mild temperatures are associated with an increase in CRD cases. The local analysis was further refined using LIME, whose application-followed by experimental verification-allowed for the identification of the critical thresholds beyond which a significant increase in the risk of hospital admission (above the 95th percentile) was observed: CO > 0.84 mg/m(3), P_atm <= 1006.81 hPa, Tavg <= 17.19 degrees C, and RH > 70.33%. The findings emphasize the potential of interpretable ML models as tools for both epidemiological analysis and prevention support, offering a valuable framework for integrating environmental surveillance with healthcare planning.

AB  - Featured Application From a clinical perspective, the proposed fast-track pathway is specifically designed to address the needs of complex patients, who typically account for a significant proportion of resource consumption in emergency departments. By targeting this high-impact population, the pathway contributes to optimising care delivery, reducing delays, and ensuring that resources are utilised more efficiently. This approach not only enhances patient outcomes but also mitigates operational challenges, making it a valuable tool for improving the overall efficiency of emergency services.Abstract Emergency department overcrowding disproportionately affects complex patients, such as older adults and those with comorbidities, who consume significant resources and experience prolonged delays. This study integrates process mining and predictive simulation to identify key factors influencing length of stay and to propose a data-driven solution: a tailored fast-track pathway for high-risk patients. Using data from 94,489 emergency episodes, a predictive formula was developed based on clinically relevant variables, including age (>65 years); triage levels (II and III); frequent emergency department visits; need for mobility aids; and specific reasons for consultation such as dyspnea, abdominal pain, and poor general condition. Simulation results demonstrated that implementing this fast-track pathway reduces length of stay by up to 21% and emergency department saturation by 35%, even with minimal resource allocation (five beds). The manual predictive formula showed comparable prediction performance to machine learning models while maintaining transparency and traceability, ensuring greater acceptability among healthcare professionals. This approach represents a paradigm shift in emergency department management, offering a scalable tool to optimise resource allocation, improve patient outcomes, and reduce operational inefficiencies. Future multicenter validations could establish this model as an essential component of emergency department management strategies.

AB  - Industry 4.0 and digital transformation will likely come with an era of changes for most manufacturers and tech industries, and even healthcare delivery will likely be affected. A few trends are already foreseeable such as an increased number of patients, advanced technologies, different health-related business models, increased costs, revised ethics, and regulatory procedures. Moreover, cybersecurity, digital invoices, price transparency, improving patient experience, management of big data, and the need for a revised education are challenges in response to digital transformation. Indeed, forward-looking innovation about exponential technologies and their effect on healthcare is now gaining momentum. Thus, we developed a framework, followed by an online survey, to investigate key areas, analyze and visualize future-oriented developments concerning technologies and innovative business models while attempting to translate visions into a strategy toward healthcare democratization. When forecasting the future of health in a short and long-term perspective, results showed that digital healthcare, data management, electronics, and sensors were the most common predictions, followed by artificial intelligence in clinical diagnostic and in which hospitals and homes would be the places of primary care. Shifting from a reactive to a proactive digital ecosystem, the focus on prevention, quality, and faster care accessibility are the novel value propositions toward democratization and digitalization of patient-centered services. Longevity will translate into increased neurodegenerative, chronic diseases, and mental illnesses, becoming severe issues for a future healthcare setup. Besides, data privacy, big data management, and novel regulatory procedures were considered as potential problems resulting from digital transformation. However, a revised education is needed to address these issues while preparing future health professionals. The "P4 of health", a novel business model that is outcome-based oriented, awareness and acceptance of technologies to support public health, a different mindset that is proactive and future-oriented, and an interdisciplinary setting to merge clinical and technological advances would be key to a novel healthcare ecosystem. Lastly, based on the developed framework, we aim to conduct regular surveys to capture up-to-date technological trends, sustainable health-related business models, and interdependencies. The engagement of stakeholders through awareness and participation is the key to recognizing and improving healthcare needs and services.

AB  - This paper presents a novel deep learning framework for ECG arrhythmias detection, integrating SpatioTemporal Adaptive Embedding (STAE) Transformers and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to improve classification accuracy and address class imbalance. Traditional ECG classification models struggle to capture longrange temporal dependencies and handle imbalanced datasets, leading to poor sensitivity for rare arrhythmias. The proposed system employs STAE Transformers to model intricate temporal and spatial relationships within ECG signals to overcome these challenges. At the same time, VAEs generate diverse and realistic ECG samples to enhance model generalization, particularly for underrepresented arrhythmias. Additionally, combining Focal Loss and Dice Loss, a Hybrid Loss Function further optimizes performance by focusing on hardto-classify arrhythmias. The model is evaluated on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmias Database and PTB Diagnostic ECG Database using 5-fold cross-validation, achieving an accuracy of 99.56% and a macro F1-score of 95.40%, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods, with a 3.5% improvement in sensitivity for rare arrhythmias. To ensure interpretability, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) are utilized, highlighting the QRS complex and RR intervals as the most critical features and confirming that the model focuses on clinically relevant waveform regions. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in developing an accurate, interpretable, and robust deep learning system for ECG arrhythmias detection, paving the way for more reliable clinical decision support systems.

AB  - Background: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based systems are receiving increasing attention in the health care sector. While the use of AI is well advanced in some medical applications, such as image recognition, it is still in its infancy in others, such as clinical decision support systems (CDSS). Examples of AI-based CDSS can be found in the context of sepsis prediction or antibiotic prescription. Scientific literature indicates that such systems can support physicians in their daily work and lead to improved patient outcomes. Nevertheless, there are various problems and barriers in this context that should be considered. Objective: This study aimed to identify opportunities to optimize AI-based CDSS and their integration into care from the perspective of experts. Methods: Semistructured web-based expert interviews were conducted. Experts representing the perspectives of patients; physicians; caregivers; developers; health insurance representatives; researchers (especially in law and IT); and experts in regulation, market admission and quality management or assurance, and ethics were included. The conversations were recorded and transcribed. Subsequently, a qualitative content analysis was performed. The different approaches to improvement were categorized into groups ("technology," "data," "users," "studies," "law," and "general"). These also served as deductive codes. Inductive codes were determined within an internal project workshop. Results: In total, 13 individual and 2 double interviews were conducted with 17 experts. A total of 227 expert statements were included in the analysis. Suggestions were heterogeneous and concerned improvements: (1) in the systems themselves (eg, implementing comprehensivesystem training involving [future] users; using a comprehensive and high-quality database; considering usability, transparency, and customizability; preventing automation bias through control mechanismsor intelligent design; conducting studies to demonstrate the benefit of the system), (2) on the user side (eg, training [future] physicians could contribute to a more positive attitude and to greater awareness and questioning decision supports suggested by the system and ensuring that the use of the system does not lead to additional work), and (3) in the environment in which the systems are used (eg, increasing the digitalization of the health care system, especially in hospitals; providing transparent public communication about the benefits and risks of AI; providing research funding; clarifying open legal issues, eg, those related to liability; and standardizing and consolidating various approval processes). Conclusions:This study offers several possible strategies for improving AI-based CDSS and their integration into health care. These werefoundintheareasof "technology," "data," "users," "studies," "law," and "general." Systems, users, and theenvironment should be taken into account to ensure that the systems are used safely, effectively, and sustainably. Further studies should investigate both the effectiveness of strategies to improveAI-based CDSS and their integration into health care and the accuracy of their match to specific problems.

AB  - This study aims to explore the potential of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and explainable Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in predicting biomarker values associated with GDM when measured 13-16 weeks prior to diagnosis. We developed a system that forecasts biomarkers such as LDL, HDL, triglycerides, cholesterol, HbA1c, and results from the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) including fasting glucose, 1-hour, and 2-hour post-load glucose values. These biomarker values are predicted based on sensory measurements collected around week 12 of pregnancy, including continuous glucose levels, short physical movement recordings, and medical background information. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to forecast GDM-associated biomarker values 13 to 16 weeks prior to the GDM screening test, using continuous glucose monitoring devices, a wristband for activity detection, and medical background data. We applied machine learning models, specifically Decision Tree and Random Forest Regressors, along with Coupled-Matrix Tensor Factorisation (CMTF) and Elastic Net techniques, examining all possible combinations of these methods across different data modalities. The results demonstrated good performance for most biomarkers. On average, the models achieved Mean Squared Error (MSE) between 0.29 and 0.42 and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) between 0.23 and 0.45 for biomarkers like HDL, LDL, cholesterol, and HbA1c. For the OGTT glucose values, the average MSE ranged from 0.95 to 2.44, and the average MAE ranged from 0.72 to 0.91. Additionally, the utilisation of CMTF with Alternating Least Squares technique yielded slightly better results (0.16 MSE and 0.07 MAE on average) compared to the well-known Elastic Net feature selection technique. While our study was conducted with a limited cohort in South Africa, our findings offer promising indications regarding the potential for predicting biomarker values in pregnant women through the integration of wearable devices and medical background data in the analysis. Nevertheless, further validation on a larger, more diverse cohort is imperative to substantiate these encouraging results.

AB  - Obesity is a major public health challenge linked to increased risks of chronic diseases. Effective prevention and intervention strategies require accurate classification and identification of key determinants. This study aims to develop a robust deep learning framework to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of obesity classification using comprehensive datasets, and to compare its performance with both traditional and state-of-the-art deep learning models. We propose a hybrid deep learning framework that combines an improved Mamba model with an attention-enhanced bidirectional LSTM (ABi-LSTM). The framework utilizes the Obesity and CDC datasets. A feature tokenizer is integrated into the Mamba model to improve scalability and representation learning. Channel-independent processing is employed to prevent overfitting through independent feature analysis. The ABi-LSTM component is used to capture complex temporal dependencies in the data, thereby enhancing classification performance. The proposed framework achieved an accuracy of 93.42%, surpassing existing methods such as ID3 (91.87%), J48 (89.98%), Na & iuml;ve Bayes (90.31%), Bayesian Network (89.23%), as well as deep learning-based approaches such as VAE (92.12%) and LightCNN (92.50%). Additionally, the model improved sensitivity to 91.11% and specificity to 92.34%. The hybrid model demonstrates superior performance in obesity classification and determinant identification compared to both traditional and advanced deep learning methods. These results underscore the potential of deep learning in enabling data-driven personalized healthcare and targeted obesity interventions.

AB  - Throughout the past decade, artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved from theoretical use to practical application in various medical specialties including neurosurgery. Given the increasing interest and exploration of AI models at national neurosurgical conferences, outlining policy for the appropriate and ethical use of AI in neurosurgery is warranted. To this end, the Council of State Neurosurgical Societies (CSNS) Workforce Committee convened an ad hoc committee to explore AI in neurosurgery following passage of a resolution at the 2024 fall meeting (Resolution II-2024 F). This editorial discusses the development process, guiding principles, and supporting evidence behind the AI policy statement. The committee conducted a thorough review of current AI tools, their applications, and their potential pitfalls. A review of existing policies from professional bodies was also conducted. The resulting policy emphasizes five core domains based on the committee's findings and the need for structured guidance in those areas. These included responsible use, privacy and security, transparency, academic integrity, and financial conflicts. The committee also conducted original investigations to explore the efficacy of AI use in certain domains that were under explored in the literature, particularly in academics, to inform key positions.

AB  - Background: Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent degenerative joint disease significantly impacting global health. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective management, but traditional methods often rely on subjective assessments. This study evaluates the efficacy of a deep learning model implemented through a no-code AI platform for diagnosing and grading knee OA from plain radiographs. Methods: We utilized the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) dataset, comprising knee X-ray data from 1526 patients. The data were split into training (47.0%), validation (26.5%), and test (26.5%) sets. We employed a ResNet101 model on the DEEP:PHI no-code AI platform for image analysis. The model was trained to classify knee OA into five grades (0-4) based on the Kellgren-Lawrence scale. Results: Our AI model demonstrated high accuracy in distinguishing between different OA grades, with particular strength in early-stage detection. The model achieved optimal performance at 20 epochs, suggesting efficient learning dynamics. Grad-CAM visualizations were used to enhance the interpretability of the model's decision-making process. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential of AI, implemented through a no-code platform, to accurately diagnose and grade knee OA from radiographs. The use of a no-code AI platform such as DEEP:PHI represents a step towards democratizing AI in healthcare, enabling the rapid development and deployment of sophisticated medical AI applications without extensive coding expertise. This approach could significantly enhance the early detection and management of knee OA, potentially improving patient outcomes and streamlining clinical workflows.

AB  - Objectives: The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of the adoption of a machine learning (ML) algorithm in support of the investment decisions regarding high cost medical devices based on available clinical and epidemiological evidence. Methods: Following a literature search, the set of epidemiological and clinical need predictors was established. Both the data from The Central Statistical Office and The National Health Fund were used. An evolutionary algorithm (EA) model was developed to obtain the prediction of the need for CT scanners across local counties in Poland (hypothetical scenario). The comparison between the historical allocation and the scenario developed by the EA model based on epidemiological and clinical need predictors was established. Only counties with available CT scanners were included in the study. Results: In total, over 4 million CT scan procedures performed across 130 counties in Poland between 2015 and 2019 were used to develop the EA model. There were 39 cases of agreement between historical data and hypothetical scenarios. In 58 cases, the EA model indicated the need for a lower number of CT scanners than the historical data. A greater number of CT procedures required compared with historical use was predicted for 22 counties. The remaining 11 cases were inconclusive. Conclusions: Machine learning techniques might be successfully applied to support the optimal allocation of limited healthcare resources. Firstly, they enable automatization of health policy making utilising historical, epidemiological, and clinical data. Secondly, they introduce flexibility and transparency thanks to the adoption of ML to investment decisions in the healthcare sector as well.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) has grown more pervasive in recent years. It makes it possible to describe the physical world in detail and interact with it in several different ways. Consequently, IoT has the potential to be involved in many different applications, including healthcare, supply chain, logistics, and the automotive sector. IoT-based smart healthcare systems have significantly increased the value of organizations that rely heavily on IoT infrastructures and solutions. In fact, with the recent COVID-19 pandemic, IoT played an important role in combating diseases. However, IoT devices are tiny, with limited capabilities. Therefore, IoT systems lack encryption, insufficient privacy protection, and subject to many attacks. Accordingly, IoT healthcare systems are extremely vulnerable to several security flaws that might result in more accurate, quick, and precise diagnoses. On the other hand, blockchain technology has been proven to be effective in many critical applications. Blockchain technology combined with IoT can greatly improve the healthcare industry's efficiency, security, and transparency while opening new commercial choices. This paper is an extension of the current effort in the IoT smart healthcare systems. It has three main contributions, as follows: (1) it proposes a smart unsupervised medical clinic without medical staff interventions. It tries to provide safe and fast services confronting the pandemic without exposing medical staff to danger. (2) It proposes a deep learning algorithm for COVID-19 detection-based X-ray images; it utilizes the transfer learning (ResNet152) model. (3) The paper also presents a novel blockchain-based pharmaceutical system. The proposed algorithms and systems have proven to be effective and secure enough to be used in the healthcare environment.

AB  - Digital twin (DT) technology is revolutionizing healthcare systems by leveraging real-time data integration and advanced analytics to enhance patient care, optimize clinical operations, and facilitate simulation. This study aimed to identify key research trends related to the application of DTs to healthcare using structural topic modeling (STM). Five electronic databases were searched for articles related to healthcare and DT. Using the held-out likelihood, residual, semantic coherence, and lower bound as metrics revealed that the optimal number of topics was eight. The "security solutions to improve data processes and communication in healthcare" topic was positioned at the center of the network and connected to multiple nodes. The "cloud computing and data network architecture" and "machine-learning algorithms for accurate detection and prediction" topics served as a bridge between technical and healthcare topics, suggesting their high potential for use in various fields. The widespread adoption of DTs in healthcare requires robust governance structures to protect individual rights, ensure data security and privacy, and promote transparency and fairness. Compliance with regulatory frameworks, ethical guidelines, and a commitment to accountability are also crucial.

AB  - Background Diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) are a payment system that could effectively solve the problem of excessive increases in healthcare costs which are applied as a principal measure in the healthcare reform in China. However, expert-oriented DRG grouping is a black box with the drawbacks of upcoding and high cost. Methods This study proposes a method of data-based grouping, designed and updated by machine learning algorithms, which could be trained by real cases, or even simulated cases. It inherits the decision-making rules from the expert-oriented grouping and improves performance by incorporating continuous updates at low cost. Five typical classification algorithms were assessed and some suggestions were made for algorithm choice. The kappa coefficients were reported to evaluate the performance of grouping. Results Based on tenfold cross-validation, experiments showed that data-based grouping had a similar classification performance to the expert-oriented grouping when choosing suitable algorithms. The groupings trained by simulated cases had less accuracy when they were tested by the real cases rather than simulated cases, but the kappa coefficients of the best model were still higher than 0.6. When the grouping was tested in a new DRGs system, the average kappa coefficients were significantly improved from 0.1534 to 0.6435 by the update; and with enough computation resources, the update process could be completed in a very short time. Conclusions As a new potential option, the data-based grouping meets the requirements of the DRGs system and has the advantages of high transparency and low cost in the design and update process.

AB  - Existing deep learning methods have achieved remarkable results in diagnosing retinal diseases, showcasing the potential of advanced AI in ophthalmology. However, the black-box nature of these methods obscures the decision-making process, compromising their trustworthiness and acceptability. Inspired by the concept-based approaches and recognizing the intrinsic correlation between retinal lesions and diseases, we regard retinal lesions as concepts and propose an inherently interpretable framework designed to enhance both the performance and explainability of diagnostic models. Leveraging the transformer architecture, known for its proficiency in capturing long-range dependencies, our model can effectively identify lesion features. By integrating with image-level annotations, it achieves the alignment of lesion concepts with human cognition under the guidance of a retinal foundation model. Furthermore, to attain interpretability without losing lesion-specific information, our method employs a classifier built on a cross-attention mechanism for disease diagnosis and explanation, where explanations are grounded in the contributions of human-understandable lesion concepts and their visual localization. Notably, due to the structure and inherent interpretability of our model, clinicians can implement concept-level interventions to correct the diagnostic errors by simply adjusting erroneous lesion predictions. Experiments conducted on four fundus image datasets demonstrate that our method achieves favorable performance against state-of-the-art methods while providing faithful explanations and enabling concept-level interventions. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Sorades/CLAT.

AB  - Content-based medical image retrieval is an important diagnostic tool that improves the explainability of computer-aided diagnosis systems and provides decision-making support to healthcare professionals. A common approach to content-based image retrieval is learning a distance metric by transforming images into a feature space where the distance between samples is a similarity measure. Proxy metric learning methods are effective at learning this transformation due to the use of proxy feature vectors that enable efficient learning. Training with a distance-based classification loss enables a single proxy model to be suitable for both retrieval and classification. However, these methods are designed only for single-label data, making them unsuitable for multimorbidity medical images. Addressing this, we propose a novel multi-label proxy metric learning method for content-based image retrieval and classification. Unlike existing proxy-based methods, training samples assign to multiple proxies that span multiple class labels. This results in a feature space that encodes the complex relationships between diseases. We introduce negative proxies to better encode the relationships between samples without detected diseases. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated experimentally on two multimorbidity radiology datasets. Results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art image retrieval systems and baseline approaches. Our method is clinically significant as it improves on two key factors shown to affect medical professionals' willingness to use computer-aided diagnosis systems: accuracy and interpretability.

AB  - Making good decisions in extremely complex and difficult processes and situations has always been both a key task as well as a challenge in the clinic and has led to a large amount of clinical, legal and ethical routines, protocols and reflections in order to guarantee fair, participatory and up-to-date pathways for clinical decision-making. Nevertheless, the complexity of processes and physical phenomena, time as well as economic constraints and not least further endeavours as well as achievements in medicine and healthcare continuously raise the need to evaluate and to improve clinical decision-making. This article scrutinises if and how clinical decision-making processes are challenged by the rise of so-called artificial intelligence-driven decision support systems (AI-DSS). In a first step, this article analyses how the rise of AI-DSS will affect and transform the modes of interaction between different agents in the clinic. In a second step, we point out how these changing modes of interaction also imply shifts in the conditions of trustworthiness, epistemic challenges regarding transparency, the underlying normative concepts of agency and its embedding into concrete contexts of deployment and, finally, the consequences for (possible) ascriptions of responsibility. Third, we draw first conclusions for further steps regarding a 'meaningful human control' of clinical AI-DSS.

AB  - Identifying intravenous immunoglobulin-resistant patients is essential for the prompt and optimal treatment of Kawasaki disease, suggesting the need for effective risk assessment tools. Data-driven approaches have the potential to identify the high-risk individuals by capturing the complex patterns of real-world data. To enable clinically applicable prediction of intravenous immunoglobulin resistance addressing the incompleteness of clinical data and the lack of interpretability of machine learning models, a multi-stage method is developed by integrating data missing pattern mining and intelligible models. First, co-clustering is adopted to characterize the block-wise data missing patterns by simultaneously grouping the clinical features and patients to enable (a) group-based feature selection and missing data imputation and (b) patient subgroup-specific predictive models considering the availability of data. Second, feature selection is performed using the group Lasso to uncover group-specific risk factors. Third, the Explainable Boosting Machine, which is an interpretable learning method based on generalized additive models, is applied for the prediction of each patient subgroup. The experiments using real-world Electronic Health Records demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework for predictive modeling compared with a set of benchmark methods. This study highlights the integration of co-clustering and supervised learning methods for incomplete clinical data mining, and promotes data-driven approaches to investigate predictors and effective algorithms for decision making in healthcare.

AB  - Cognitive computing systems (CCS) are a new class of computing systems that implement more human-like cognitive abilities. CCS are not a typical technological advancement but an unprecedented advance toward human-like systems fueled by artificial intelligence. Such systems can adapt to situations, perceive their environments, and interact with humans and other technologies. Due to these properties, CCS are already disrupting established industries, such as retail, insurance, and healthcare. As we make the case in this paper, the increasingly human-like capabilities of CCS challenge five fundamental assumptions that we as IS researchers have held about how users interact with IT artifacts. These assumptions pertain to (1) the direction of the user-artifact relationship, (2) the artifact's awareness of its environment, (3) functional transparency, (4) reliability, and (5) the user's awareness of artifact use. We argue that the disruption of these five assumptions limits the applicability of our extant body of knowledge to CCS. Consequently, CCS present a unique opportunity for novel theory development and associated contributions. We argue that IS is well positioned to take this opportunity and present research questions that, if answered, will lead to interesting, influential, and original theories.

TI  - Dual level dengue diagnosis using lightweight multilayer perceptron with XAI in fog computing environment and rule based inference
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA  - English
AB  - Over the last fifty years, arboviral infections have made an unparalleled contribution to worldwide disability and morbidity. Globalization, population growth, and unplanned urbanization are the main causes. Dengue is regarded as the most significant arboviral illness among them due to its prior dominance in growth. The dengue virus is mostly transmitted to humans by Aedes mosquitoes. The human body infected with dengue virus (DenV) will experience certain adverse impacts. To keep the disease under control, some of the preventative measures implemented by different countries need to be updated. Manual diagnosis is typically employed, and the accuracy of the diagnosis is assessed based on the experience of the healthcare professionals. Because there are so many patients during an outbreak, incompetence also happens. Remote monitoring and massive data storage are required. Though cloud computing is one of the solutions, it has a significant latency, despite its potential for remote monitoring and storage. Also, the diagnosis should be made as quickly as possible. The aforementioned issue has been resolved with fog computing, which significantly lowers latency and facilitates remote diagnosis. This study especially focuses on incorporating machine learning and deep learning techniques in the fog computing environment to leverage the overall diagnostic efficiency of dengue by promoting remote diagnosis and speedy treatment. A dual-level dengue diagnosis framework has been proposed in this study. Level-1 diagnosis is based on the symptoms of the patients, which are sent from the edge layer to the fog. Level-1 diagnosis is done in the fog to manage the storage and computation issues. An optimized and normalized lightweight MLP has been proposed along with preprocessing and feature reduction techniques in this study for the Level-1 Diagnosis in the fog computing environment. Pearson Correlation coefficient has been calculated between independent and target features to aid in feature reduction. Techniques like K-fold cross-validation, batch normalization, and grid search optimization have been used for increasing the efficiency. A variety of metrics have been computed to assess the effectiveness of the model. Since the suggested model is a "black box," explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) tools such as SHAP and LIME have been used to help explain its predictions. An exceptional accuracy of 92% is attained with the small dataset using the proposed model. The fog layer sends the list of probable cases to the edge layer. Also, a precision of 100% and an F1 score of 90% have been attained using the proposed model. The list of probable cases is sent from the fog layer to the edge layer, where Level-2 Diagnosis is carried out. Level-2 diagnosis is based on the serological test report of the suspected patients of the Level-1 diagnosis. Level-2 diagnosis is done at the edge using the rule-based inference method. This study incorporates dual-level diagnosis, which is not seen in recent studies. The majority of investigations end at Level 1. However, this study minimizes incorrect treatment and fatality rates by using dual-level diagnosis and assisting in confirmation of the disease.

AB  - Thanks to the significant developments in healthcare industries, various types of medical data are generated. Analysing such valuable resources aid healthcare experts to understand the illnesses more precisely and provide better clinical services. Machine learning as one of the capable tools could assist healthcare experts in achieving expressive interpretation and making proper decisions. As annotation of medical data is a costly and sensitive task that can be performed just by healthcare professionals, label-free methods could be significantly promising. Interpretability and evidence-based decision are other concerns in medicine. These needs were our motivators to propose a novel clustering method based on hierarchical Dirichlet process mixtures of multivariate Beta distributions. To learn it, we applied batch and online variational methods for finding the proper number of clusters as well as estimating model parameters at the same time. The effectiveness of the proposed models is evaluated on three medical real applications, namely oropharyngeal carcinoma diagnosis, osteosarcoma analysis, and white blood cell counting.

AB  - BackgroundThe rapidly growing quantity of health data presents researchers with ample opportunity for innovation. At the same time, exploitation of the value of Big Data poses various ethical challenges that must be addressed in order to fulfil the requirements of responsible research and innovation (Gerke et al. 2020; Howe III and Elenberg 2020). Data sovereignty and its principles of self-determination and informed consent are central goals in this endeavor. However, their consistent implementation has enormous consequences for the collection and processing of data in practice, especially given the complexity and growth of data in healthcare, which implies that artificial intelligence (AI) will increasingly be applied in the field due to its potential to unlock relevant, but previously hidden, information from the growing number of data (Jiang et al. 2017). Consequently, there is a need for ethically sound guidelines to help determine how data sovereignty and informed consent can be implemented in clinical research.MethodsUsing the method of a narrative literature review combined with a design thinking approach, this paper aims to contribute to the literature by answering the following research question: What are the practical requirements for the thorough implementation of data sovereignty and informed consent in healthcare?ResultsWe show that privacy-preserving technologies, human-centered usability and interaction design, explainable and trustworthy AI, user acceptance and trust, patient involvement, and effective legislation are key requirements for data sovereignty and self-determination in clinical research. We outline the implications for the development of IT solutions in the German healthcare system.
   HintergrundDie exponentiell wachsende Verf & uuml;gbarkeit von Gesundheitsdaten bietet Forschenden ungeahnte Potenziale f & uuml;r Innovationen. Gleichzeitig gehen mit der Verwertung von Big Data auch gro ss e ethische Herausforderungen einher, die es zu bew & auml;ltigen gilt, um den Anforderungen an verantwortungsvolle Forschung und Innovation gerecht zu werden (Gerke et al. 2020; Howe III und Elenberg 2020). Datensouver & auml;nit & auml;t und die damit verbundenen Grunds & auml;tze der Selbstbestimmung und der informierten Zustimmung sind dabei zentrale Ziele. Allerdings hat deren konsistente Umsetzung enorme Konsequenzen f & uuml;r die Datenerhebung und -verarbeitung in der Praxis. Dies trifft insbesondere angesichts einer Zunahme an Quantit & auml;t und Komplexit & auml;t von Daten im Gesundheitswesen zu. Denn aufgrund des Potenzials, relevante aber bisher verborgene Informationen aus der Datenmenge zu erschlie ss en, ist eine zunehmende Anwendung von k & uuml;nstlicher Intelligenz (KI) in diesem Bereich zu erwarten (Jiang et al. 2017). Folglich besteht ein Bedarf an ethisch fundierten Handlungsanweisungen, die helfen, Datensouver & auml;nit & auml;t und informierte Zustimmung in der klinischen Forschung umzusetzen.Material und MethodenDurch Anwendung einer narrativen Literaturrecherche in Kombination mit einem Design-Thinking-Ansatz soll das vorliegende Papier einen Beitrag zur Literatur leisten, indem die folgende Forschungsfrage beantwortet wird: Welche praktischen Anforderungen gibt es f & uuml;r eine konsequente Umsetzung von Datensouver & auml;nit & auml;t und informierter Einwilligung im Gesundheitswesen?ErgebnisseEs wird gezeigt, dass Privatsph & auml;re wahrende Technologien, menschenzentriert entwickelte Nutzungs- und Interaktionsl & ouml;sungen, erkl & auml;rbare und vertrauensw & uuml;rdige KI, Nutzerakzeptanz und -vertrauen, Patientenbeteiligung und eine wirksame Gesetzgebung zentrale Voraussetzungen f & uuml;r Datensouver & auml;nit & auml;t und Selbstbestimmung in der klinischen Forschung sind.

AB  - IntroductionMaternal mortality refers to a mother's death owing to complications arising from childbirth or pregnancy. This issue is a forefront public health challenge around the globe which is pronounced in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in the sub-Saharan African regions where the burdens remain significantly high. Moreover, this problem is further complicated in developing countries due to limited access to antenatal care and the shortage of skilled birth attendants. So far, considerable improvements in the health status of many populations have been reported in developing countries. Nonetheless, the MDGs to reduce maternal and newborn mortality unmet in many SSA nations. Leveraging machine learning approaches allows us to better understand these constraints and predict skilled birth attendance among reproductive age women, providing actionable insights for policy and intervention.ObjectiveThis study aimed to predict skill birth attendance and identify its determinants among reproductive age women in 27 SSA countries using machine learning algorithm.MethodsUsing data from the Demographic and Health Surveys (2016-2024) across 27 SSA countries, we analyzed responses from 198,707 reproductive age women. The Random Forest classifier, complemented by SHAP for feature interpretability, was employed for prediction and analysis. Data preprocessing included K-nearest neighbor imputation for missing values, SMOTE for handling class imbalance, and Recursive Feature Elimination for feature selection. Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC.ResultsThe Random Forest model demonstrated robust performance, achieving an AUC-ROC of 92%, recall of 96%, accuracy of 92%, precision of 93 and F1 score of 93%.

AB  - The rise of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has enhanced healthcare delivery but also exposed critical cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Detecting attacks in such environments demands accurate, interpretable, and cost-efficient models. This paper addresses the critical challenges in network security, particularly in IoMT, through advanced machine learning (ML) approaches. We propose a high-performance cybersecurity framework leveraging a carefully fine-tuned XGBoost classifier to detect malicious attacks with superior predictive accuracy while maintaining interpretability. Our comprehensive evaluation compares the proposed model with a well-regularized Logistic Regression baseline using key performance metrics. Additionally, we analyze the security-cost trade-off in designing ML systems for threat detection and employ SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to identify key features driving predictions. We further introduce a late fusion approach based on max voting that effectively combines the strengths of both models. Results demonstrate that while XGBoost achieves higher accuracy (0.97) and recall (1.00) compared to Logistic Regression, our late fusion model provides a more balanced performance with improved precision (0.98) and reduced false negatives, making it particularly suitable for security-sensitive applications. This work contributes to developing robust, interpretable, and efficient ML solutions for addressing evolving cybersecurity challenges in networked environments.

AB  - Sound target detection (STD) has received increasing attention in research areas such as industrial monitoring, medical diagnosis, and military detection. However, existing STD models face significant challenges in achieving robustness and generalization. In this study, to address the challenges, we develop an autonomous STD model that combines an encoding model, which maps sound signals to electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, with a decoding model, which identifies target information from EEG signals. Furthermore, we propose a model optimization strategy based on a weight loss function to balance the neural interpretability with sound recognition performance to enhance detection accuracy. Experiment results show that the proposed model demonstrates higher robustness and generalization, especially under low SNR conditions, than baseline methods. This work is the first to develop an autonomous STD model using brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and consider auditory cognitive function in biomimetic sound detection, significantly advancing the application of BCI-based detection in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, it provides new insights into utilizing human intelligence through BCIs and offers new solutions for integrating BCIs with artificial intelligence technologies.

AB  - Background. The occurrence of distant metastases (DM) limits the overall survival (OS) of patients with chondrosarcoma (CS). Early diagnosis and treatment of CS remains a great challenge in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to investigate metastatic factors and develop a risk stratification model for clinicians' decision making. Methods. Six machine learning (ML) algorithms, including logistic regression (LR), plain Bayesian classifier (NBC), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), gradient boosting machine (GBM) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). A 10-fold cross validation was performed for each model separately, multicenter data was used as external validation, and the best (highest AUC) model was selected to build the network calculator. Results. A total of 1,385 patients met the inclusion criteria, including 82 (5.9%) patients with metastatic CS. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the risk of DM was significantly higher in patients with higher pathologic grades, T-stage, N stage, and non-left primary lesions, as well as those who did not receive surgery and chemotherapy. The AUC of the six ML algorithms for predicting DM ranged from 0.911-0.985, with the extreme gradient enhancement algorithm (XGBoost) having the highest AUC. Therefore, we used the XGB model and uploaded the results to an online risk calculator for estimating DM risk. Conclusions. In this study, combined with adequate SEER case database and external validation with data from multicenter institutions in different geographic regions, we confirmed that CS, T, N, laterality, and grading of surgery and chemotherapy were independent risk factors for DM. Based on the easily available clinical risk factors, machine learning algorithms built the XGB model that predicts the best outcome for DM. An online risk calculator helps simplify the patient assessment process and provides decision guidance for precision medicine and long-term cancer surveillance, which contributes to the interpretability of the model.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the leading cause of mortality worldwide, highlighting the urgent need for advanced diagnostic tools to improve early detection and patient outcomes. This study evaluates the predictive performance of two machine learning models-Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)-across five datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, Long Beach VA, and Statlog Heart. Comprehensive preprocessing steps-including imputation, standardization, one-hot encoding, and SMOTEENN-were applied to ensure data consistency and address class imbalance. XGBoost achieved perfect accuracy (100%) on the Switzerland and Statlog datasets, reflecting its strength in structured data environments and consistent predictive performance. Conversely, ANFIS outperformed XGBoost on the Cleveland dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in modeling complex, nonlinear relationships. Performance evaluation metrics included accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, F2 score, and ROC-AUC. XGBoost consistently delivered high precision and recall, which are essential for minimizing false positives and negatives in clinical settings. ANFIS yielded high F2 scores, indicating a stronger emphasis on reducing false negatives-a critical concern in CVD diagnosis. This comparative analysis suggests that while XGBoost is well suited for scalable, high-throughput diagnostic applications, ANFIS offers greater interpretability and is more effective in nuanced clinical scenarios. These findings underscore the potential of integrating advanced machine learning models into cardiovascular disease prediction frameworks to enhance diagnostic accuracy and support real-world healthcare decision-making.

AB  - BackgroundDiscrimination between patients affected by inflammatory bowel diseases and healthy controls on the basis of endoscopic imaging is an challenging problem for machine learning models. Such task is used here as the testbed for a novel deep learning classification pipeline, powered by a set of solutions enhancing characterising elements such as reproducibility, interpretability, reduced computational workload, bias-free modeling and careful image preprocessing.ResultsFirst, an automatic preprocessing procedure is devised, aimed to remove artifacts from clinical data, feeding then the resulting images to an aggregated per-patient model to mimic the clinicians decision process. The predictions are based on multiple snapshots obtained through resampling, reducing the risk of misleading outcomes by removing the low confidence predictions. Each patient's outcome is explained by returning the images the prediction is based upon, supporting clinicians in verifying diagnoses without the need for evaluating the full set of endoscopic images. As a major theoretical contribution, quantization is employed to reduce the complexity and the computational cost of the model, allowing its deployment on small power devices with an almost negligible 3% performance degradation. Such quantization procedure holds relevance not only in the context of per-patient models but also for assessing its feasibility in providing real-time support to clinicians even in low-resources environments. The pipeline is demonstrated on a private dataset of endoscopic images of 758 IBD patients and 601 healthy controls, achieving Matthews Correlation Coefficient 0.9 as top performance on test set.ConclusionWe highlighted how a comprehensive pre-processing pipeline plays a crucial role in identifying and removing artifacts from data, solving one of the principal challenges encountered when working with clinical data. Furthermore, we constructively showed how it is possible to emulate clinicians decision process and how it offers significant advantages, particularly in terms of explainability and trust within the healthcare context. Last but not least, we proved that quantization can be a useful tool to reduce the time and resources consumption with an acceptable degradation of the model performs. The quantization study proposed in this work points up the potential development of real-time quantized algorithms as valuable tools to support clinicians during endoscopy procedures.

TI  - AI-Enhanced Rural Medical Education: Bridging Gaps and Building Trust
T2  - ACADEMIC MEDICINE
LA  - English
AB  - Persistent geographic and specialty-based disparities in health care workforce distribution have created critical gaps in rural health care access, resulting in disproportionate morbidity and mortality in underserved communities. This commentary examines how strategically implemented artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies can facilitate the development of competent, community-oriented physicians capable of delivering high-quality care in rural settings.Key challenges in rural medical education are identified, including resource limitations, infrastructure deficiencies, and difficulty attracting qualified educators, while acknowledging rural training's unique benefits, including hands-on procedural experience, broader clinical scope, and meaningful mentoring relationships. AI-powered tools can transform rural medical education through virtual patient simulations, personalized learning platforms, clinical decision support systems, and automated performance evaluation-technologies that democratize access to educational resources, standardize learning experiences across geographic locations, and provide personalized learning pathways.AI can foster the development of rural community-focused and trained physicians by analyzing community health patterns, enhancing cultural sensitivity training, and simulating real-world rural health care barriers. However, this technology is rapidly evolving, and implementation must address ethical considerations, including data privacy, algorithmic bias, transparency, and equitable access. By integrating AI responsibly, medical educators can prepare physicians to thrive in rural practice-potentially increasing patient-physician trust and reducing health care disparities.

AB  - Ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) are critical cardiovascular diseases that require rapid and accurate detection. Conventional approaches relying on multi-lead ECG or deep learning models have limitations in computational cost, interpretability, and real-time applicability on wearable devices. To address these issues, a lightweight and interpretable framework based on multiple complex networks was proposed for the detection of life-threatening VAs using short-term single-lead ECG signals. The input signals were decomposed using the fixed-frequency-range empirical wavelet transform, and sub-bands were subsequently analyzed through multiscale visibility graphs, recurrence networks, cross-recurrence networks, and joint recurrence networks. Eight topological features were extracted and input into an XGBoost classifier for VA identification. Ten-fold cross-validation results on the MIT-BIH VFDB and CUDB databases demonstrated that the proposed method achieved a sensitivity of 99.02 +/- 0.53%, a specificity of 98.44 +/- 0.43%, and an accuracy of 98.73 +/- 0.02% for 10 s ECG segments. The model also maintained robust performance on shorter segments, with 97.23 +/- 0.76% sensitivity, 98.85 +/- 0.95% specificity, and 96.62 +/- 0.02% accuracy on 2 s segments. The results outperformed existing feature-based and deep learning approaches while preserving model interpretability. Furthermore, the proposed method supports mobile deployment, facilitating real-time use in wearable healthcare applications.

AB  - Agentic intelligence encompasses artificial intelligence systems imbued with autonomous capacity, facilitating independent decision-making beyond conventional automation frameworks. This study applies the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol across three authoritative databases and others, examining peer-reviewed literature from 2020 to 2025 (March). From 1800 identified publications, 191 studies met inclusion criteria, revealing research concentrations: 35.1 % (64 studies) address computational scalability, privacy/security vulnerabilities, ethical/legal ramifications, and interpretability constraints; 24.0 % (44) each examine Industry 4.0 transformation and healthcare intervention systems; 9.8 % (18) investigate autonomous cybersecurity architectures; 16.4 % (30) each focus on personalized digital assistance and theoretical foundations; while 14.7 % (27) each explore intelligent energy distribution networks, quantum computational integration with robotics, and sustainability imperatives. The analysis juxtaposes agentic intelligence against traditional automation, elucidating distinctive characteristics within variable environments. Foundational technological enablers, large language models, reinforcement learning algorithms, multi-agent system frameworks, cognitive architectures, and edge-cloud computing integration propel advancements in capabilities. Implementations spanning energy distribution networks, cybersecurity mechanisms, manufacturing ecosystems, healthcare platforms, and digital assistance technologies demonstrate transformative potential. The investigation identifies computational limitations, ethical challenges, and trust-related impediments, providing a comparative assessment of advantages and constraints. Future research trajectories, including quantum computation, are proposed to advance theoretical and practical dimensions. This synthesis provides researchers, practitioners, and policymakers with an authoritative examination of agentic intelligence foundations and implications for advanced autonomous system development.

AB  - Introduction: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare, particularly through hybrid chatbots, is reshaping the industry by enhancing service delivery, patient engagement, and clinical outcomes. These chatbots combine AI with human input to provide intelligent, personalized interactions in areas like diagnostics, chronic disease management, and mental health support. However, gaps remain in trust, data security, system integration, and user experience, which hinder widespread adoption. Key challenges include the hesitancy of patients to trust AI due to concerns over data privacy and the accuracy of medical advice, as well as difficulties in integrating chatbots into existing healthcare infrastructures. The review aims to assess the effectiveness of hybrid AI chatbots in improving healthcare outcomes, reducing costs, and enhancing patient engagement, while identifying barriers to adoption such as cultural adaptability and trust issues. The novelty of the review lies in its comprehensive exploration of both technological advancements and the socio-emotional factors influencing chatbot acceptance. Methods: The review follows a systematic methodology with four core components: eligibility criteria, review selection, data extraction, and data synthesis. Studies focused on AI applications and hybrid chatbots in healthcare, particularly in chronic disease management and mental health support, were included. Publications from 2022 to 2025 were prioritized, and peer-reviewed sources in English were considered. After screening 116 studies, 29 met the criteria for inclusion. Data was extracted using a structured template, capturing study objectives, methodologies, findings, and challenges. Thematic analysis was applied to identify four themes: AI applications, technical advancements, user adoption, and challenges/ethical concerns. Statistical and content analysis methods were employed to synthesize the data comprehensively, ensuring robustness in the findings. Results: Hybrid chatbots in healthcare have shown significant benefits, such as reducing hospital readmissions by up to 25%, improving patient engagement by 30%, and cutting consultation wait times by 15%. They are widely used for chronic disease management, mental health support, and patient education, demonstrating their efficiency in both developed and developing countries. Discussion: The review concludes that overcoming these barriers through infrastructure investment, training, and enhanced transparency is crucial for maximizing the potential of AI in healthcare. Future researchers should focus on long-term outcomes, addressing ethical considerations, and expanding cross-cultural adaptability. Limitations of the review include the narrow scope of some case studies and the absence of long-term data on AI's efficacy in diverse healthcare contexts. Further studies are needed to explore these challenges and the long-term impact of AI-driven healthcare solutions.

TI  - protPheMut: An Interpretable Machine Learning Tool for Classification of Cancer and Neurodevelopmental Disorders in Human Missense Mutations
T2  - JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING
LA  - English
AB  - Recent advances in human genomics have revealed that missense mutations in a single protein can lead to distinctly different phenotypes. In particular, some mutations in oncoproteins like MEK1, MEK2, PI3K alpha, PTEN, SHAP2, and RAS are linked various cancers and neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). While numerous tools exist for predicting the pathogenicity of missense mutations, linking these mutations to certain phenotypes remains a major challenge, particularly in the context of personalized medicine. To fill this gap, we developed protPheMut (Protein Phenotypic Mutations Analyzer, http://netprotlab.com/protPheMut), leveraging interpretable machine learning approaches and enhancing model transparency through SHAP explanations, to integrate diverse biophysical and network dynamics-based signatures for predicting whether mutations in the same protein promote cancer or NDDs. Overall, proPheMut achieved an AUCROC of 0.9118 in cross-validation and 0.8925 on an independent test set for discriminating cancer- versus NDDs-related mutations. We further illustrate its utility in phenotype (cancer/NDDs) prediction by mutation analyses of two protein cases, PI3K alpha and PTEN. Compared to seven other predictive tools, protPheMut demonstrated exceptional accuracy in forecasting phenotypic effects, achieving an AUROC of 0.8501 for PI3K alpha mutations related to cancer and Cowden syndrome. For multi-phenotype prediction of PTEN mutations related to cancer, PHTS, and HCPS, protPheMut achieved an AUROC of 0.9349 through micro averaging. Using SHAP model explanations, protPheMut highlights the strength of network and dynamic features in deeper uncovering of the effects of pathogenic mutations, thus classifying different disease phenotypes.

AB  - Conductive hydrogels as wearable devices meet the basic demands of mechanical flexibility and smart sensing. However, achieving a combination of adequate skin adhesion, long-term stability and visible human-sensor interface are still challengeable. Here, a simple and effective strategy was proposed to fabricate "all-in-one" hydrolyzed keratin protein-modified polyacrylamide composite hydrogel transducer. Hydrolyzed keratin endowed hydrogel with lower modulus and ultra-stretchability to minimize wearing-related tension and discomfort. Specially, robust skin adhesion was obtained to achieve precise sensing without delamination. Impressively, the hydrogel had high transparency and exhibited wide-range temperature tolerance (-20 degrees C to 50 degrees C). Besides, the hydrogel with stable conductivity was extremely sensitive to pressure and strain at a wide range. As a result, the obtained transducer could not only detect human motion, respiratory mode and vocal-cord vibration, but also identify handwriting and facial expression. This work shed a new light on the design of next generation skin-like electronic devices with applications in human-machine interface, ionic skin, artificial intelligence and healthcare monitoring.

AB  - Blockchain technology is found to have its applicability in almost every domain because of its advantages such as crypto-security, transparency, immutability, decentralized data network. In present times, a smart healthcare system with a blockchain data network and healthcare 4.0 processes provides transparency, easy and faster accessibility, security, efficiency, etc. Healthcare 4.0 trends include industry 4.0 processes such as the internet of things (IoT), industrial IoT (IIoT), cognitive computing, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, fog computing, edge computing, etc. The goal of this work is to design a smart healthcare system and it is found to be possible through integration and interoperability of Blockchain 3.0 and Healthcare 4.0 in consideration with healthcare ground-realities. Here, healthcare 4.0 processes used for data accessibility are targeted to be validated through statistical simulation-optimization methods and algorithms. The blockchain is implemented in the Ethereum network, and with associated programming languages, tools, and techniques such as solidity, web3.js, Athena, etc. Further, this work prepares a comparative and comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art blockchain-based smart healthcare systems. The comprehensive survey includes methodology, applications, requirements, outcomes, future directions, etc. A list of groups, organizations, and enterprises are prepared that are working in electronic health records (EHR), electronic medical records (EMR) or electronic personal records (EPR) mainly, and a comparative analysis is drawn concerning adopting the blockchain technology in their processes. This work has explored optimization algorithms applicable to Healthcare 4.0 trends and improves the performance of blockchain-based decentralized applications for the smart healthcare system. Further, smart contracts and their designs are prepared for the proposed system to expedite the trust-building and payment systems. This work has considered simulation and implementation to validate the proposed approach. Simulation results show that the Gas value required (indicating block size and expenditure) lies within current Etherum network Gas limits. The proposed system is active because block utilization lies above 80%. Automated smart contract execution is below 20 seconds. A good number (average 3 per simulation time) is generated in the network that indicates a health competition. Although there is error observed in simulation and implementation that lies between 0.55% and 4.24%, these errors are not affecting overall system performance because simulated and actual (taken in state-of-the-art) data variations are negligible.

AB  - Background: Sinonasal tumors are rare, accounting for 3-5% of head and neck neoplasms. Machine learning (ML) and radiomics have shown promise in tumor classification, but current models lack detailed morphological and textural characterization. Methods: This study analyzed MRI data from 145 patients (76 malignant and 69 benign) across multiple centers. Radiomic features were extracted from T1-weighted (T1-w) images with contrast and T2-weighted (T2-w) images based on manually annotated tumor volumes. A dedicated ML pipeline assessed the effectiveness of different radiomic features and their integration with clinical variables. The DNetPRO algorithm was used to extract signatures combining radiomic and clinical data. Results: The results showed that ML classification using both data types achieved a median Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.60 +/- 0.07. The best-performing DNetPRO models reached an MCC of 0.73 (T1-w + T2-w) and 0.61 (T1-w only). Key clinical features included symptoms and tumor size, while radiomic features provided additional diagnostic insights, particularly regarding gray-level distribution in T2-w and texture complexity in T1-w images. Conclusions: Despite its potential, ML-based radiomics faces challenges in clinical adoption due to data variability and model diversity. Standardization and interpretability are crucial for reliability. The DNetPRO approach helps explain feature importance and relationships, reinforcing the clinical relevance of integrating radiomic and clinical data for sinonasal tumor classification.

AB  - ObjectivesThe elderly are disproportionately affected by age-related hearing loss (ARHL). Despite being a well-known tool for ARHL evaluation, the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly Screening version (HHIE-S) has only traditionally been used for direct screening using self-reported outcomes. This work uses a novel integration of machine learning approaches to improve the predicted accuracy of the HHIE-S tool for ARHL in older adults.MethodsWe employed a dataset that was gathered between 2016 and 2018 and included 1,526 senior citizens from several Taipei City Hospital branches. 80% of the data were used for training (n = 1220) and 20% were used for testing (n = 356). XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, and LightGBM were among the machine learning models that were only used and assessed on the training set. In order to prevent data leakage and overfitting, the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) model-which had the greatest AUC of 0.83 (95% CI 0.81-0.85)-was then only used on the holdout testing data.ResultsOn the testing set, the LGBM model showed a strong AUC of 0.82 (95% CI 0.79-0.86), far outperforming conventional techniques. Notably, several HHIE-S items and age were found to be significant characteristics. In contrast to traditional HHIE research, which concentrates on the psychological effects of hearing loss, this study combines cutting-edge machine learning techniques-specifically, the LGBM classifier-with the HHIE-S tool. The incorporation of SHAP values enhances the interpretability of the model's predictions and provides a more comprehensive comprehension of the significance of various aspects.ConclusionsOur methodology highlights the great potential that arises from combining machine learning with validated hearing evaluation instruments such as the HHIE-S. Healthcare practitioners can anticipate ARHL more accurately thanks to this integration, which makes it easier to intervene quickly and precisely.

KW  - GENETICS
AB  - Understanding the genetic ancestry of populations is central to numerous scientific and societal fields. It contributes to a better understanding of human evolutionary history, advances personalized medicine, aids in forensic identification, and allows individuals to connect to their genealogical roots. Existing methods, such as ADMIXTURE, have significantly improved our ability to infer ancestries. However, these methods typically work with a fixed number of independent ancestral populations. As a result, they provide insight into genetic admixture, but do not include a hierarchical interpretation. In particular, the intricate ancestral population structures remain difficult to unravel. Alternative methods with a consistent inheritance structure, such as hierarchical clustering, may offer benefits in terms of interpreting the inferred ancestries. Here, we present tangleGen, a soft clustering tool that transfers the hierarchical machine learning framework Tangles, which leverages graph theoretical concepts, to the field of population genetics. The hierarchical perspective of tangleGen on the composition and structure of populations improves the interpretability of the inferred ancestral relationships. Moreover, tangleGen adds a new layer of explainability, as it allows identifying the single-nucleotide polymorphisms that are responsible for the clustering structure. We demonstrate the capabilities and benefits of tangleGen for the inference of ancestral relationships, using both simulated data and data from the 1000 Genomes Project.

AB  - Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are data structures that enable the integration of heterogeneous data sources and supporting both knowledge representation and formal reasoning. This paper introduces TrustKG, a KG-based framework designed to enhance the interpretability and reliability of hybrid AI systems in healthcare. Positioned within the context of lung cancer, TrustKG supports link prediction, which uncovers hidden relationships within medical data, and counterfactual prediction, which explores alternative scenarios to understand causal factors. These tasks are addressed through two specialized hybrid AI systems, VISE and HealthCareAI, which combine symbolic reasoning with inductive learning over KGs to provide interpretable AI solutions for clinical decision-making. Leveraging KGs to represent biomedical properties and relationships, and augmenting them with learned patterns through symbolic reasoning, our hybrid approach produces models that are both accurate and transparent. This interpretability is particularly important in medical applications, where trust and reliability in AI-driven predictions are paramount. The empirical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of VISE and HealthCareAI in improving the predictive accuracy and clarity of model outputs. By addressing challenges in link prediction-such as discovering previously unknown connections between medical entities-and in counterfactual prediction, TrustKG, with VISE and HealthCareAI, underscores the potential of integrating KGs with symbolic AI to create trustworthy, interpretable AI systems in healthcare. This paper contributes to the advancement of semantic AI, offering a pathway for robust and reliable AI solutions in clinical settings.

TI  - An explainable ensemble approach for advanced brain tumor classification applying Dual-GAN mechanism and feature extraction techniques over highly imbalanced data
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Brain tumors are one of the leading diseases imposing a huge morbidity rate across the world every year. Classifying brain tumors accurately plays a crucial role in clinical diagnosis and improves the overall healthcare process. ML techniques have shown promise in accurately classifying brain tumors based on medical imaging data such as MRI scans. These techniques aid in detecting and planning treatment early, improving patient outcomes. However, medical image datasets are frequently affected by a significant class imbalance, especially when benign tumors outnumber malignant tumors in number. This study presents an explainable ensemble-based pipeline for brain tumor classification that integrates a Dual-GAN mechanism with feature extraction techniques, specifically designed for highly imbalanced data. This Dual-GAN mechanism facilitates the generation of synthetic minority class samples, addressing the class imbalance issue without compromising the original quality of the data. Additionally, the integration of different feature extraction methods facilitates capturing precise and informative features. This study proposes a novel deep ensemble feature extraction (DeepEFE) framework that surpasses other benchmark ML and deep learning models with an accuracy of 98.15%. This study focuses on achieving high classification accuracy while prioritizing stable performance. By incorporating Grad-CAM, it enhances the transparency and interpretability of the overall classification process. This research identifies the most relevant and contributing parts of the input images toward accurate outcomes enhancing the reliability of the proposed pipeline. The significantly improved Precision, Sensitivity and F1-Score demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism in handling class imbalance and improving the overall accuracy. Furthermore, the integration of explainability enhances the transparency of the classification process to establish a reliable model for brain tumor classification, encouraging their adoption in clinical practice promoting trust in decision-making processes.

AB  - Background: Asthma hospital encounters impose a heavy burden on the health care system. To improve preventive care and outcomes for patients with asthma, we recently developed a black-box machine learning model to predict whether a patient with asthma will have one or more asthma hospital encounters in the succeeding 12 months. Our model is more accurate than previous models. However, black-box machine learning models do not explain their predictions, which forms a barrier to widespread clinical adoption. To solve this issue, we previously developed a method to automatically provide rule-based explanations for the model's predictions and to suggest tailored interventions without sacrificing model performance. For an average patient correctly predicted by our model to have future asthma hospital encounters, our explanation method generated over 5000 rule-based explanations, if any. However, the user of the automated explanation function, often a busy clinician, will want to quickly obtain the most useful information for a patient by viewing only the top few explanations. Therefore, a methodology is required to appropriately rank the explanations generated for a patient. However, this is currently an open problem.
   Objective: The aim of this study is to develop a method to appropriately rank the rule-based explanations that our automated explanation method generates for a patient.
   Methods: We developed a ranking method that struck a balance among multiple factors. Through a secondary analysis of 82,888 data instances of adults with asthma from the University of Washington Medicine between 2011 and 2018, we demonstrated our ranking method on the test case of predicting asthma hospital encounters in patients with asthma.
   Results: For each patient predicted to have asthma hospital encounters in the succeeding 12 months, the top few explanations returned by our ranking method typically have high quality and low redundancy. Many top-ranked explanations provide useful insights on the various aspects of the patient's situation, which cannot be easily obtained by viewing the patient's data in the current electronic health record system.
   Conclusions: The explanation ranking module is an essential component of the automated explanation function, and it addresses the interpretability issue that deters the widespread adoption of machine learning predictive models in clinical practice. In the next few years, we plan to test our explanation ranking method on predictive modeling problems addressing other diseases as well as on data from other health care systems.

AB  - Background: Critically ill patients in intensive care units (ICUs) require continuous monitoring, generating vast amounts of data. Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have shown promise in improving diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic decision-making. However, these models are rarely implemented in clinical practice. Objective: The aim of this study was to survey ICU physicians to understand their expectations, opinions, and level of knowledge regarding a proposed AI-based CDSS for continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) weaning, a clinical decision-making process that is still complex and lacking in guidelines. This will be used to guide the development of an AI-based CDSS on which our team is working to ensure user-centered design and successful integration into clinical practice. Methods: A prospective cross-sectional survey of French-speaking physicians with clinical activity in intensive care was conducted between December 2023 and April 2024. The questionnaire consisted of 20 questions structured around 4 axes: overview of the problem and current practices concerning weaning from CRRT, opinion on AI-based CDSS, implementation in daily clinical practice, real-life operation and willingness to adopt the CDSS in everyday practice. Statistical analyses included Wilcoxon rank sum tests for quantitative variables and chi 2 or Fisher exact tests for qualitative variables, with multivariate analyses performed using ordinal logistic regression. Results: A total of 171 complete responses were received. Physicians expressed an interest in a CDSS for CRRT weaning, with 70.2% (120/171) viewing AI-based CDSS favorably. Opinions were split regarding the difficulty of the weaning decision itself, with 46.2% (79/171) disagreeing that it is challenging, while 31.6% (54/171) agreed. However, 66.1% (113/171) of respondents supported the value of an AI-based CDSS to assist them in this decision, with younger physicians showing stronger support (81.8%, 27/33 vs 62.3%; 86/138; P=.01). Most respondents (163/171, 95.3%) emphasized the importance of understanding the criteria used by the model to make its predictions. Conclusions: Our findings highlight an optimistic attitude among ICU physicians toward AI-based CDSS for CRRT weaning, emphasizing the need for transparency, integration into existing workflows, and alignment with clinicians' decision-making processes. Actionable recommendations include incorporating key variables such as urine output and biological parameters, defining probability thresholds for recommendations and ensuring model transparency to facilitate the successful adoption and integration into clinical practice. The methodology of this survey may help the development of further predevelopment studies accompanying AI-based CDSS projects.

AB  - The high prevalence of patient absenteeism in medical appointments poses significant challenges for healthcare providers and patients, causing delays in service delivery and increasing operational inefficiencies. Addressing this issue is crucial in the internal medicine department, a fundamental pillar of comprehensive adult healthcare that manages various chronic and complex conditions. To mitigate absenteeism, we present an innovative application of machine learning models specifically designed to predict the risk of patient absenteeism in the internal medicine department of Fundaci & oacute;n Valle del Lili, a high-complexity hospital in Colombia. Leveraging an institutional database, we conducted a statistical analysis to identify critical variables influencing absenteeism risk, including clinical and sociodemographic factors and characteristics of previously attended appointments. Our study evaluated seven distinct machine learning models, explored various data processing techniques, and addressed class imbalance through oversampling and undersampling strategies. Hyperparameter optimization was conducted for each model configuration, culminating in selecting the Bagging RandomForest model, which demonstrated outstanding performance when combined with standardized data and balanced using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). Additionally, Shapley values (SHAP) were applied to enhance the interpretability of the model, enabling the identification of the most influential variables in predicting medical absenteeism, such as the number of previous absences, the day and month of the appointment, and diagnosed diseases. The selected model achieved a predictive accuracy of 84.80 +/- 0.81%, an AUC value of 0.89, an F1-score of 84.75%, and a recall of 83.02% in cross-validation experiments. These results highlight the potential of our experimental approach to identify the most suitable model for proactively predicting patients at high risk of absenteeism, optimizing resource allocation, and improving the quality of medical care in internal medicine in the future. Our methodology provides a foundation for reducing operational inefficiencies and strengthening intervention strategies. This benefits healthcare providers and patients through more timely and effective care. Ultimately, this approach contributes to improving patient outcomes and institutional efficiency.

AB  - BackgroundThis study aims to develop and validate a multi-modal machine learning model for preoperative risk stratification in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), addressing limitations of current systems that rely on postoperative pathological features. MethodsWe analyzed 974 PTC patients from three medical centers in China using a multi-modal approach integrating: (1) clinical indicators, (2) immunological indices, (3) ultrasound radiomics features, and (4) CT radiomics features. Our methodology employed gradient boosting machine for feature selection and random forest for classification, with model interpretability provided through SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. The model was validated on internal (n = 225) and two external cohorts (n = 51, n = 174). ResultsThe final 15-feature model achieved AUCs of 0.91, 0.84, and 0.77 across validation cohorts, improving to 0.96, 0.95, and 0.89 after cohort-specific refitting. SHAP analysis revealed CT texture features, ultrasound morphological features, and immune-inflammatory markers as key predictors, with consistent patterns across validation sites despite center-specific variations. Subgroup analysis showed superior performance in tumors > 1 cm and patients without extrathyroidal extension. ConclusionOur multi-modal machine learning approach provides accurate preoperative risk stratification for PTC with robust cross-center applicability. This computational framework for integrating heterogeneous imaging and clinical data demonstrates the potential of multi-modal joint learning in healthcare imaging to transform clinical decision-making by enabling personalized treatment planning.

AB  - Artificial hydrocarbon networks (AHN) a supervised learning method inspired on organic chemical structures and mechanisms - have shown improvements in predictive power and interpretability in comparison with other well-known machine learning models. However, AHN are very time-consuming that are not able to deal with large data until now. In this paper, we introduce the stochastic parallel extreme artificial hydrocarbon networks (SPE-AHN), an algorithm for fast and robust training of supervised AHN models in high-dimensional data. This training method comprises a population-based meta-heuristic optimization with defined individual encoding and objective function related to the AHN-model, an implementation in parallel-computing, and a stochastic learning approach for consuming large data. We conducted three experiments with synthetic and real data sets to validate the training execution time and performance of the proposed algorithm. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed SPE-AHN outperforms the original-AHN method, increasing the speed of training more than 10,000x times in the worst case scenario. Additionally, we present two case studies in real data sets for solar-panel deployment prediction (regression problem), and human falls and daily activities classification in healthcare monitoring systems (classification problem). These case studies showed that SPE-AHN improves the state-of-the-art machine learning models in both engineering problems. We anticipate our new training algorithm to be useful in many applications of AHN like robotics, finance, medical engineering, aerospace, and others, in which large amounts of data (e.g. big data) is essential.

AB  - The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with healthcare has opened new avenues for diagnosing, treating, and managing medical conditions with remarkable precision. Uveitis, a diverse group of rare eye conditions characterized by inflammation of the uveal tract, exemplifies the complexities in ophthalmology due to its varied causes, clinical presentations, and responses to treatments. Uveitis, if not managed promptly and effectively, can lead to significant visual impairment. However, its management requires specialized knowledge, which is often lacking, particularly in regions with limited access to health services. AI's capabilities in pattern recognition, data analysis, and predictive modelling offer significant potential to revolutionize uveitis management. AI can classify disease etiologies, analyze multimodal imaging data, predict outcomes, and identify new therapeutic targets. However, transforming these AI models into clinical applications and meeting patient expectations in- volves overcoming challenges like acquiring extensive, annotated datasets, ensuring algorithmic transparency, and validating these models in real-world settings. This review delves into the complexities of uveitis and the current AI landscape, discussing the development, opportunities, and challenges of AI from theoretical models to bedside application. It also examines the epidemiology of uveitis, the global shortage of uveitis specialists, and the disease's socioeconomic impacts, underlining the critical need for AI-driven approaches. Furthermore, it explores the integration of AI in diagnostic imaging and future directions in ophthalmology, aiming to highlight emerging trends that could transform management of a patient with uveitis and suggesting collaborative efforts to enhance AI applications in clinical practice.

TI  - RETRACTED: Enhancing stroke disease classification through machine learning models via a novel voting system by feature selection techniques (Retracted article. See vol. 20, 2025)
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Heart disease remains a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, necessitating the development of accurate and reliable predictive models to facilitate early detection and intervention. While state of the art work has focused on various machine learning approaches for predicting heart disease, but they could not able to achieve remarkable accuracy. In response to this need, we applied nine machine learning algorithms XGBoost, logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), gaussian naive bayes (NB gaussian), adaptive boosting, and linear regression to predict heart disease based on a range of physiological indicators. Our approach involved feature selection techniques to identify the most relevant predictors, aimed at refining the models to enhance both performance and interpretability. The models were trained, incorporating processes such as grid search hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation to minimize overfitting. Additionally, we have developed a novel voting system with feature selection techniques to advance heart disease classification. Furthermore, we have evaluated the models using key performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC). Among the models, XGBoost demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving 99% accuracy, precision, F1-Score, 98% recall, and 100% ROC AUC. This study offers a promising approach to early heart disease diagnosis and preventive healthcare.

KW  - tumor diagnosis
KW  - attention mechanism
KW  - whole-slide images
KW  - computer-aided diagnosis
AB  - This study introduces an innovative deep learning framework to address the limitations of traditional pathological image analysis and the pressing demand for medical resources in tumor diagnosis. With the global rise in cancer cases, manual examination by pathologists is increasingly inadequate, being both time-consuming and subject to the scarcity of professionals and individual subjectivity, thus impacting diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Deep learning, particularly in computer vision, offers significant potential to mitigate these challenges. Automated models can rapidly and accurately process large datasets, revolutionizing tumor detection and classification. However, existing methods often rely on single attention mechanisms, failing to fully exploit the complexity of pathological images, especially in extracting critical features from whole-slide images. We developed a framework incorporating a cascaded attention mechanism, enhancing meaningful pattern recognition while suppressing irrelevant background information. Experiments on the Camelyon16 dataset demonstrate superior classification accuracy, model generalization, and result interpretability compared to state-of-the-art techniques. This advancement promises to enhance diagnostic efficiency, reduce healthcare costs, and improve patient outcomes.

AB  - Objective As the prevalence of diabetes steadily increases, the burden of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is also intensifying. In response, we have utilized a 10-year diabetes cohort from our medical center to train machine learning-based models for predicting DKD and interpreting relevant factors.Methods Employing a large dataset from 73,101 hospitalized type 2 diabetes patients at The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, we analyzed demographic and medication data. Machine learning models, including XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest, AdaBoost, GBDT (gradient boosting decision tree), and SGD (stochastic gradient descent), were trained on these data, focusing on interpretability by SHAP. SHAP explains the output of the models by assigning an importance value to each feature for a particular prediction, enabling a clear understanding of how individual features influence the prediction outcomes.Results The XGBoost model achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.95 and an area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR) of 0.76, while CatBoost recorded an AUC of 0.97 and an AUPR of 0.84. These results underscore the effectiveness of these models in predicting DKD in patients with type 2 diabetes.Conclusions This study provides a comprehensive approach for predicting DKD in patients with type 2 diabetes, employing machine learning techniques. The findings are crucial for the early detection and intervention of DKD, offering a roadmap for future research and healthcare strategies in diabetes management. Additionally, the presence of non-diabetic kidney diseases and diabetes with complications was identified as significant factors in the development of DKD.

AB  - Objective Postpartum depression (PPD) is a common and serious mental health complication after childbirth, with potential negative consequences for both the mother and her infant. This study aimed to develop an explainable machine learning model to predict the risk of PPD and to identify its key predictive factors.Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted on 1,065 women who attended their 6-week postpartum follow-up visit at a tertiary maternal and child healthcare hospital in Shenyang, China, from January to December 2021. Feature selection was performed using LASSO regression and the Boruta algorithm. Eight machine learning algorithms were then employed to construct the prediction models. Model performance was evaluated according to the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, recall, F1 score, and accuracy. Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) were used to visualize the features of the model and individual case predictions.Results Among the 1,065 women, 251 (23.5%) developed PPD. An 11-variable prediction model was developed, with XGBoost showing the best performance on both training and validation sets. After optimizing the model parameters and applying 10-fold cross-validation, the model achieved an average accuracy of 0.95, an average AUC of 0.955, average precision of 0.945, and average specificity of 0.985, indicating excellent predictive performance. The key predictive factors included weight gain during pregnancy, relationship with the mother-in-law, sleep quality, marital relationship, planned pregnancy, fetal sex preference, pregnancy-related anxiety, pelvic-floor muscle endurance, cervix status, attendance at prenatal education classes, and postpartum care satisfaction.Conclusion The XGBoost model demonstrated optimal performance at predicting PPD and can aid healthcare professionals to identify high-risk individuals. The SHAP method enhanced the model's interpretability, facilitating a better understanding of the causes of PPD, how to prevent it, and how to improve patient outcomes.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Brain tumor classification is a crucial task in medical diagnostics, as early and accurate detection can significantly improve patient outcomes. This study investigates the effectiveness of pre-trained deep learning models in classifying brain MRI images into four categories: Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary, and No Tumor, aiming to enhance the diagnostic process through automation. Methods: A publicly available Brain Tumor MRI dataset containing 7023 images was used in this research. The study employs state-of-the-art pre-trained models, including Xception, MobileNetV2, InceptionV3, ResNet50, VGG16, and DenseNet121, which are fine-tuned using transfer learning, in combination with advanced preprocessing and data augmentation techniques. Transfer learning was applied to fine-tune the models and optimize classification accuracy while minimizing computational requirements, ensuring efficiency in real-world applications. Results: Among the tested models, Xception emerged as the top performer, achieving a weighted accuracy of 98.73% and a weighted F1 score of 95.29%, demonstrating exceptional generalization capabilities. These models proved particularly effective in addressing class imbalances and delivering consistent performance across various evaluation metrics, thus demonstrating their suitability for clinical adoption. However, challenges persist in improving recall for the Glioma and Meningioma categories, and the black-box nature of deep learning models requires further attention to enhance interpretability and trust in medical settings. Conclusions: The findings underscore the transformative potential of deep learning in medical imaging, offering a pathway toward more reliable, scalable, and efficient diagnostic tools. Future research will focus on expanding dataset diversity, improving model explainability, and validating model performance in real-world clinical settings to support the widespread adoption of AI-driven systems in healthcare and ensure their integration into clinical workflows.

AB  - In high-stakes decision-making environments, predictive models must deliver not only high accuracy but also reliable uncertainty estimations and transparent explanations. This study explores the integration of probability calibration techniques with Conformal Prediction (CP) within a predictive process monitoring (PPM) framework tailored to healthcare analytics. CP is renowned for its distribution-free prediction regions and formal coverage guarantees under minimal assumptions; however, its practical utility critically depends on well-calibrated probability estimates. We compare a range of post-hoc calibration methods-including parametric approaches like Platt scaling and Beta calibration, as well as non-parametric techniques such as Isotonic Regression and Spline calibration-to assess their impact on aligning raw model outputs with observed outcomes. By incorporating these calibrated probabilities into the CP framework, our multilayer analysis evaluates improvements in prediction region validity, including tighter coverage gaps and reduced minority error contributions. Furthermore, we employ SHAP-based explainability to explain how calibration influences feature attribution for both high-confidence and ambiguous predictions. Experimental results on process-driven healthcare data indicate that the integration of calibration with CP not only enhances the statistical robustness of uncertainty estimates but also improves the interpretability of predictions, thereby supporting safer and robust clinical decision-making.

AB  - Featured Application An explainable computer-aided diagnosis system for cardiovascular diseases can be a valuable tool for primary health care. Medical experts can utilize such tools to pinpoint unhealthy patients accurately and early, hence decongesting the National Healthcare Service (NHS). In recent times, coronary artery disease (CAD) prediction and diagnosis have been the subject of many Medical decision support systems (MDSS) that make use of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms. The common ground of most of these applications is that they function as black boxes. They reach a conclusion/diagnosis using multiple features as input; however, the user is oftentimes oblivious to the prediction process and the feature weights leading to the eventual prediction. The primary objective of this study is to enhance the transparency and comprehensibility of a black-box prediction model designed for CAD. The dataset employed in this research comprises biometric and clinical information obtained from 571 patients, encompassing 21 different features. Among the instances, 43% of cases of CAD were confirmed through invasive coronary angiography (ICA). Furthermore, a prediction model utilizing the aforementioned dataset and the CatBoost algorithm is analyzed to highlight its prediction making process and the significance of each input datum. State-of-the-art explainability mechanics are employed to highlight the significance of each feature, and common patterns and differences with the medical bibliography are then discussed. Moreover, the findings are compared with common risk factors for CAD, to offer an evaluation of the prediction process from the medical expert's point of view. By depicting how the algorithm weights the information contained in features, we shed light on the black-box mechanics of ML prediction models; by analyzing the findings, we explore their validity in accordance with the medical literature on the matter.

AB  - Background: Standards-based clinical data normalization has become a key component of effective data integration and accurate phenotyping for secondary use of electronic healthcare records (EHR) data. HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is an emerging clinical data standard for exchanging electronic healthcare data and has been used in modeling and integrating both structured and unstructured EHR data for a variety of clinical research applications. The overall objective of this study is to develop and evaluate a FHIR-based EHR phenotyping framework for identification of patients with obesity and its multiple comorbidities from semi-structured discharge summaries leveraging a FHIR-based clinical data normalization pipeline (known as NLP2FHIR).
   Methods: We implemented a multi-class and multi-label classification system based on the i2b2 Obesity Challenge task to evaluate the FHIR-based EHR phenotyping framework. Two core parts of the framework are: (a) the conversion of discharge summaries into corresponding FHIR resources - Composition, Condition, MedicationStatement, Procedure and FamilyMemberHistory using the NLP2FHIR pipeline, and (b) the implementation of four machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, support vector machine, decision tree, and random forest) to train classifiers to predict disease state of obesity and 15 comorbidities using features extracted from standard FHIR resources and terminology expansions. We used the macro- and micro-averaged precision (P), recall (R), and F1 score (Fl) measures to evaluate the classifier performance. We validated the framework using a second obesity dataset extracted from the MIMIC-III database.
   Results: Using the NLP2FHIR pipeline, 1237 clinical discharge summaries from the 2008 i2b2 obesity challenge dataset were represented as the instances of the FHIR Composition resource consisting of 5677 records with 16 unique section types. After the NLP processing and FHIR modeling, a set of 244,438 FHIR clinical resource instances were generated. As the results of the four machine learning classifiers, the random forest algorithm performed the best with Fl-micro(0.9466)/F1-macro(0.7887) and Fl-micro(0.9536)/F1-macro(0.6524) for intuitive classification (reflecting medical professionals' judgments) and textual classification (reflecting the judgments based on explicitly reported information of diseases), respectively. The MIMIC-III obesity dataset was successfully integrated for prediction with minimal configuration of the NLP2FHIR pipeline and machine learning models.
   Conclusions: The study demonstrated that the FHIR-based EHR phenotyping approach could effectively identify the state of obesity and multiple comorbidities using semi-structured discharge summaries. Our FHIR-based phenotyping approach is a first concrete step towards improving the data aspect of phenotyping portability across EHR systems and enhancing interpretability of the machine learning-based phenotyping algorithms.

AB  - BackgroundAgeing is one of the most important challenges in our society. Evaluating how one is ageing is important in many aspects, from giving personalized recommendations to providing insight for long-term care eligibility. Machine learning can be utilized for that purpose, however, user reservations towards "black-box" predictions call for increased transparency and explainability of results. This study aimed to explore the potential of developing a machine learning-based healthy ageing scale that provides explainable results that could be trusted and understood by informal carers.MethodsIn this study, we used data from 696 older adults collected via personal field interviews as part of independent research. Explanatory factor analysis was used to find candidate healthy ageing aspects. For visualization of key aspects, a web annotation application was developed. Key aspects were selected by gerontologists who later used web annotation applications to evaluate healthy ageing for each older adult on a Likert scale. Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest, KNN, SVM and XGBoost were used for multi-classification machine learning. AUC OvO, AUC OvR, F1, Precision and Recall were used for evaluation. Finally, SHAP was applied to best model predictions to make them explainable.ResultsThe experimental results show that human annotations of healthy ageing could be modelled using machine learning where among several algorithms XGBoost showed superior performance. The use of XGBoost resulted in 0.92 macro-averaged AuC OvO and 0.76 macro-averaged F1. SHAP was applied to generate local explanations for predictions and shows how each feature is influencing the prediction.ConclusionThe resulting explainable predictions make a step toward practical scale implementation into decision support systems. The development of such a decision support system that would incorporate an explainable model could reduce user reluctance towards the utilization of AI in healthcare and provide explainable and trusted insights to informal carers or healthcare providers as a basis to shape tangible actions for improving ageing. Furthermore, the cooperation with gerontology specialists throughout the process also indicates expert knowledge as integrated into the model.

AB  - Introduction Mental health issues bring a heavy burden to individuals and societies around the world. Recently, the large language model ChatGPT has demonstrated potential in depression intervention. The primary objective of this study was to ascertain the viability of ChatGPT as a tool for aiding counselors in their interactions with patients while concurrently evaluating its comparability to human-generated content (HGC).Methods We propose a novel framework that integrates state-of-the-art AI technologies, including ChatGPT, BERT, and SHAP, to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of mental health interventions. ChatGPT generates responses to user inquiries, which are then classified using BERT to ensure the reliability of the content. SHAP is subsequently employed to provide insights into the underlying semantic constructs of the AI-generated recommendations, enhancing the interpretability of the intervention.Results Remarkably, our proposed methodology consistently achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 93.76%. We discerned that ChatGPT always employs a polite and considerate tone in its responses. It refrains from using intricate or unconventional vocabulary and maintains an impersonal demeanor. These findings underscore the potential significance of AIGC as an invaluable complementary component in enhancing conventional intervention strategies.Discussion This study illuminates the considerable promise offered by the utilization of large language models in the realm of healthcare. It represents a pivotal step toward advancing the development of sophisticated healthcare systems capable of augmenting patient care and counseling practices.

AB  - Aims Science podcasts have proved to be valuable mediums for medical education and science dissemination. Tools adopting rapidly evolving technologies such as generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) now enable us to create podcasts in a matter of minutes (e.g. NotebookLM, Jellypod). However, GenAI entails challenges, such as hallucinations, which could compromise the trustworthiness of generated content. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the quality of AI-generated podcasts and their potential for science communication.Methods and results We conducted a mixed-method evaluation of 10 AI-generated podcasts for articles published in the European Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing. Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire and were invited for a video interview. They were not informed of the AI-nature of the podcast prior to evaluation. Only half of them were able to identify this aspect. The fact that the podcast was able to summarize key findings in an easily understandable and engaging manner was found to be a great asset. However, participants also indicated that the American style of the podcast took away from its credibility. Moreover, some podcasts contained inaccuracies, incorrect use of medical terms and mispronunciations, thereby compromising trustworthiness. Podcasts were found to be most appropriate for patients and the public but could be useful for researchers and healthcare professionals as well if they were tailored accordingly. Rigorous evaluation and transparency about the AI-generated nature of the podcast, referencing the original article and author acknowledgement were recommended.Conclusion AI-generated podcasts could be relevant additions to scientific journal articles and valuable alternatives for traditional science podcasts.

AB  - An accurate and reliable functional prognosis is vital to stroke patients addressing rehabilitation, to their families, and healthcare providers. This study aimed at developing and validating externally patient-wise prognostic models of the global functional outcome at discharge from intensive inpatient post-acute rehabilitation after stroke, based on a standardized comprehensive multidimensional assessment performed at admission to rehabilitation. Patients addressing intensive inpatient rehabilitation pathways within 30 days from stroke were prospectively enrolled in two consecutive multisite studies. Demographics, description of the event, clinical/functional, and psycho-social data were collected. The outcome of interest was disability in basic daily living activities at discharge, measured by the modified Barthel Index (mBI). Machine learning-based prognostic models were developed, internally cross-validated, and externally validated. Interpretability techniques were applied for the analysis of predictors. 385 patients were considered, 220 (165) for training (external test) sets. A 50.9% (55.8%) of women, 79.5% (80.0%) of ischemic, and a median [interquartile range- IQR] age of 80.0[15.0] (79.0[17.0]) were registered. The Support Vector Machine obtained the best validation performances and a median absolute error [IQR] on discharge mBI estimation of 11.5[15.0] and 9.2[13.0] points on the internal and external testing, respectively. The baseline variables providing the main contributions to the predictions were mBI, motor upper-limb score, age, and cognitive screening score. We achieved a solution to support the formulation of a functional prognosis at intensive rehabilitation admission. The interpretability analysis confirms the relevance of easily collected motor and cognitive dataat admission and of the patient's age.Trial registration: Prospectively registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (registration numbers RIPS NCT03866057, STRATEGY NCT05389878).

AB  - Aim: This study aimed to explore the factors influencing undergraduate nursing students' use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools in their studies, examining how this usage shapes their learning experiences and perceptions of traditional pedagogical approaches. Background: The integration of AI into healthcare is rapidly transforming clinical practice, which in turn necessitates a corresponding shift in nursing education. While AI's potential benefits and challenges in education are widely discussed, limited research has focused on how nursing students specifically use these tools in their nursing studies and how this impacts their learning processes. Design: A qualitative study employing exploratory and descriptive designs. Methods: Participants were recruited from an undergraduate nursing program at a tertiary university. Thematic analysis was used to analyze interview data. Results: Key findings revealed that nursing students use AI for personalized learning, bridging the theory-practice gap and managing time constraints. International students particularly found AI valuable for cultural adaptation and language support. A significant finding was the "open secret" of AI use, with students actively using tools despite institutional discouragement, highlighting a disconnect between student needs and institutional practices. Ethical concerns, such as bias, data privacy and accountability, were also prominent. Conclusion: This study provides novel insights into the student-driven demand for AI integration in nursing education. It highlights the need for institutional responsiveness, transparency and the development of ethical AI frameworks. By acknowledging student agency and fostering collaborative dialogue, nursing education can leverage AI's benefits effectively while upholding the profession's core values: compassion, empathy and humancentered care.

AB  - Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into critical domains such as healthcare holds immense promise. Nevertheless, significant challenges must be addressed to avoid harm, promote the well-being of individuals and societies, and ensure ethically sound and socially just technology development. Innovative approaches like Embedded Ethics, which refers to integrating ethics and social science into technology development based on interdisciplinary collaboration, are emerging to address issues of bias, transparency, misrepresentation, and more. This paper aims to develop this approach further to enable future projects to effectively deploy it. Based on the practical experience of using ethics and social science methodology in interdisciplinary AI-related healthcare consortia, this paper presents several methods that have proven helpful for embedding ethical and social science analysis and inquiry. They include (1) stakeholder analyses, (2) literature reviews, (3) ethnographic approaches, (4) peer-to-peer interviews, (5) focus groups, (6) interviews with affected groups and external stakeholders, (7) bias analyses, (8) workshops, and (9) interdisciplinary results dissemination. We believe that applying Embedded Ethics offers a pathway to stimulate reflexivity, proactively anticipate social and ethical concerns, and foster interdisciplinary inquiry into such concerns at every stage of technology development. This approach can help shape responsible, inclusive, and ethically aware technology innovation in healthcare and beyond.

AB  - The growing application of machine learning (ML) techniques in healthcare has led to increased interest in federated learning (FL), which enables the secure and private training of robust ML models. However, conventional FL methods often fall short of providing adequate privacy protection and face challenges in handling non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) training data. These shortcomings are of significant concern when employing FL in electronic devices in healthcare. To address these issues, we propose an Auditable Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning (AP2FL) model tailored for electronics in healthcare settings. By leveraging Trusted Execution Environments (TEE), AP2FL ensures secure training and aggregation processes on both client and server sides, effectively mitigating data leakage risks. To manage Non-IID data within the proposed framework, we incorporate the Active Personalized Federated Learning (ActPerFL) model and Batch Normalization (BN) techniques to consolidate user updates and identify data similarities. Additionally, we introduce an auditing mechanism in AP2FL that reveals the contribution of each client to the FL process, facilitating the updating of the global model following diverse data types and distributions. In other words, it ensures the FL process's integrity, transparency, fairness, and robustness. Our results demonstrate that the proposed AP2FL model outperforms existing methods in accuracy and effectively eliminates privacy leakage.

TI  - Artificial intelligence for diagnosing rare bone diseases: a global survey of healthcare professionals
T2  - ORPHANET JOURNAL OF RARE DISEASES
LA  - English
AB  - BackgroundRare bone diseases (RBDs) are an important group of conditions characterized by abnormalities in bone and cartilage. Their large number, individual rarity, and heterogeneity make accurate and timely diagnosis challenging. Establishing correlations between genotype and phenotype (mainly via imaging) is critical for diagnosing RBDs. Image recognition artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to significantly improve the diagnostic process by assisting healthcare providers to identify and differentiate imaging patterns associated with various RBDs. This survey study sought to assess the interest of various healthcare providers worldwide in utilizing an AI-based assistant tool for the differential diagnosis of RBDs.MethodSurvey data were collected from March to September 2024. The survey was performed online and the link was disseminated via direct email, newsletters, and flyers at scientific talks and conferences.ResultsWe received 103 completed surveys, representing respondents from 27 different countries covering most global regions, but mostly from Europe, the United States, and Canada. The majority of the participants are physicians (n = 92, 89%) and primarily work at academic medical centers (n = 84, 81%). While each participant could select multiple specialties, the most frequent clinician types were medical geneticists, pediatricians, and endocrinologists, accounting for 71 (69%) of the respondents. Ninety-four (91%) of the respondents find imaging to be very or extremely important, and the majority (n = 84, 81%) consider X-rays to be the most important imaging modality. Although around half of the participants (n = 45) have concerns about AI-related errors and consider the explainability of AI algorithms to be very (42/103) or extremely (9/103) important, 81% of the respondents report that they are somewhat (n = 39) or extremely (n = 45) likely to consider integrating image recognition AI into their current diagnostic workflow.ConclusionsMost survey participants are open to integrating image recognition AI into their RBD diagnostic workflow. However, concerns about AI-related errors, privacy, and model interpretability highlight the importance of transparent collaboration between developers and healthcare professionals throughout the development process to ensure that such technologies are clinically trustworthy and practically adoptable.

AB  - To understand the biological characteristics of neurological disorders with functional connectivity (FC), recent studies have widely utilized deep learning-based models to identify the disease and conducted post-hoc analyses via explainable models to discover disease-related biomarkers. Most existing frameworks consist of three stages, namely, feature selection, feature extraction for classification, and analysis, where each stage is implemented separately. However, if the results at each stage lack reliability, it can cause misdiagnosis and incorrect analysis in afterward stages. In this study, we propose a novel unified framework that systemically integrates diagnoses (i.e., feature selection and feature extraction) and explanations. Notably, we devised an adaptive attention network as a feature selection approach to identify individual-specific disease-related connections. We also propose a functional network relational encoder that summarizes the global topological properties of FC by learning the inter-network relations without pre-defined edges between functional networks. Last but not least, our framework provides a novel explanatory power for neuroscientific interpretation, also termed counter-condition analysis. We simulated the FC that reverses the diagnostic information (i.e., counter-condition FC): converting a normal brain to be abnormal and vice versa. We validated the effectiveness of our framework by using two large resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets, Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) and REST-meta-MDD, and demonstrated that our framework outperforms other competing methods for disease identification. Furthermore, we analyzed the disease-related neurological patterns based on counter-condition analysis.

AB  - Background: Bayesian networks are seeing increased usage in healthcare, particularly for modeling complex treatment decisions under uncertainty. Bayesian networks offer significant advantages over classical machine learning and deep learning techniques due to their interpretability, with the network visualized through a directed acyclic graph outlining conditional relationships. Prior clinical knowledge can also be incorporated into these networks to enhance their clarity and facilitate integration into clinical workflows. However, out-of-box optimization techniques may produce networks that are not logically coherent or reflective of clinical understanding and may focus solely on optimizing information-based metrics without consideration for performance metrics crucial for developing predictive models. In late morbidity modeling, where the risk factors surrounding an outcome may be complex, intercorrelated, and not yet fully identified, it is important to have a customizable optimization approach to automatically produce logical, interpretable Bayesian networks that outline these complex outcomes. Purpose: Develop a simulated annealing-based framework for developing Bayesian network structures for late morbidity prediction in cervical cancer patients, addressing limitations of traditional optimization techniques and prioritizing interpretability. Methods: This study utilizes the multi-center EMBRACE I cervical cancer dataset (n = 1153) to develop Bayesian network structures for late moderate-to-severe (grade >= 2) cystitis (CTCAEv.3) prediction. The dataset was split into training/validation data (80%) and holdout test data (20%). A process of 10 x 5-fold cross-validation was integrated into the optimization framework. A simulated annealing-based optimization method was developed incorporating information-theoretic measures, predictive performance measures, and complexity measures. The different network structures developed by this framework were compared in terms of complexity, interpretability, and predictive performance to optimization methods available out-of-box from the PyAgrum package for Python (Greedy Hill Climbing, Tree-Augmented Na & iuml;ve Bayes, and Chow-Liu Optimization). Bayesian networks were also compared to conventional machine learning classifiers in terms of feature importance and predictive performance. Differences in model predictions arising from structure differences were assessed with Cochran's Q-test (p < 0.05). Results: The simulated annealing framework demonstrated the ability to produce Bayesian network structures with comparable or superior predictive performance compared to out-of-box models. A statistically significant performance difference was identified between the simulated annealing and out-of-box methods with Cochran's Q-test (p = 0.03). The simulated annealing approach equalled or outperformed out-of-box models on a bootstrapped holdout test set, with a balanced accuracy of 64.1%, an F1 macro score of 55.9%, and an ROC-AUC of 0.66. Simulated annealing models also featured fewer arcs and nodes, with this simplification resulting in networks that were easier to interpret without compromising on predictive performance, highlighting the effectiveness of simulated annealing in creating highly interpretable models for clinical use. Conclusion: The proposed simulated annealing-based framework represents a novel method for automatically generating Bayesian network structures for cervical cancer late morbidity modeling.
   Compared to out-of-box optimization techniques, the simulated annealing Bayesian networks provide comparable or superior predictive performance while constructing a more simple, interpretable network useful for clinical implementation.

AB  - The utilization of health insurance claims data has expanded significantly, enabling researchers to conduct epidemiological studies on a large scale. This review examines key statistical methods for addressing baseline differences and conducting cohort analyses using Korean National Health Insurance claims data. Propensity score matching and inverse probability of treatment weighting are widely used to mitigate selection bias and enhance causal inference in observational studies. These methods help improve study validity by balancing covariates between treatment and control groups. Additionally, survival analysis techniques, such as the Cox proportional hazards model, are essential for assessing time-to- event outcomes and estimating hazard ratios while accounting for censoring. However, the application of these statistical methods is accompanied by challenges, including unmeasured confounding, instability in weight estimation, and violations of model assumptions. To address these limitations, emerging approaches, such as Doubly robust estimation, machine learning-based causal inference, and the marginal structural model, have gained prominence. These techniques offer greater flexibility and robustness in real-world data analysis. Future research should focus on refining methodologies for integrating high- dimensional health datasets and leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance predictive modeling and causal inference. Furthermore, the expansion of international collaborations and the adoption of standardized data models will facilitate large-scale multi-center studies. Ethical considerations, including data privacy and algorithmic transparency, should also be prioritized to ensure responsible data use. Maximizing the utility of health insurance claims data requires interdisciplinary collaboration, methodological advancements, and the implementation of rigorous statistical techniques to support evidence-based healthcare policy and improve public health outcomes.

AB  - Background Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a common and debilitating complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), significantly impacting patients' quality of life and increasing healthcare burdens. Early prediction and intervention are critical to mitigating its impact.Methods This study analyzed 1,544 diabetic patients from the First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University, who were randomly divided into a training cohort (n = 1,082) and a testing cohort (n = 462) using a 7:3 split ratio. Feature selection was performed using both Boruta and LASSO algorithms, and the intersection of the selected variables was used as the final predictor set. Eight key predictors were identified from 23 variables, including diabetes duration, uric acid, HbA1c, NLR, smoking status, SCR, LDH, and hypertension. Nine machine learning models were developed and compared for DPN risk prediction.Results Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGBT) demonstrated the best performance (training AUC: 0.933, 95% CI: 0.921-0.946; testing AUC: 0.811, 95% CI: 0.776-0.843). Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis provided interpretability, highlighting the clinical importance of diabetes duration and HbA1c among other predictors.Conclusion This study establishes a robust predictive tool for early DPN detection, laying the foundation for improved prevention and management strategies.

AB  - Objectives: Predicting preoperative cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is crucial for assessing the risk of complications and adverse outcomes in patients undergoing surgery. CRF is formally evaluated through submaximal exercise testing with cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) or the 6-minute walk test (6MWT). However, formal CRF testing is impractical as a preoperative screening tool. Wrist-worn devices with actigraphy and heart rate monitoring have become increasingly capable of predicting physiological measurements. Our aim was to develop a clinically interpretable machine learning (ML) model using wearable-derived physiological data to predict CRF for older adults, and to access whether this model can accurately estimate the 6MWT distances for preoperative risk evaluation. Methods: We examined heart rate and activity data collected from Fitbit devices worn by older adults (N = 65) who were scheduled to undergo major noncardiac surgery. Data collection took place over a 1-week period prior to surgery while participants engaged in their typical daily activities. Our primary aim was to leverage this wearable technology to forecast CRF among this group. We employed a machine-learning ensemble regression model to predict CRF, using 6MWT outcomes as an index. Further, we applied the shapley feature attribution approach to gain insights into how specific features derived from wearable data contribute to CRF prediction within the model, aiding in personalized fitness prediction. Results: Adults with higher CRF exhibited elevated levels of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), maximal activity energy expenditure (aEEmax), heart rate recovery (HRR), and non-linear heart rate variability (HRV). These measures increased concurrently with improvements in 6MWT outcomes. Our regression models, employing random forest and linear regression techniques, demonstrated strong predictive capabilities, with coefficient of determination values of 0.91 and 0.81, respectively, for estimating CRF. The shapley feature attribution approach elucidated those greater levels of MVPA, aEEmax, HRR, and nonlinear dynamics of HRV serve as reliable indicators of enhanced CRF test performance. Conclusion: The integration of wearable data-driven activity and heart rate metrics forms the basis for utilizing wearables to provide preoperative cardiorespiratory fitness assessments, supporting surgical risk stratification, personalized prehabilitation, and improved patient outcomes.

AB  - Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that has heavy consequences on a child's wellbeing, especially in the academic, psychological and relational planes. The current evaluation of the disorder is supported by clinical assessment and written tests. A definitive diagnosis is usually made based on the DSM-V criteria. There is a lot of ongoing research on ADHD, in order to determine the neurophysiological basis of the disorder and to reach a more objective diagnosis. The advent of Machine Learning (ML) opens up promising prospects for the development of systems able to predict a diagnosis from phenotypic and neuroimaging data. This was the reason why the ADHD-200 contest was launched a few years ago. Based on the publicly available ADHD-200 collection, participants were challenged to predict ADHD with the best possible predictive accuracy. In the present work, we propose instead a ML methodology which primarily places importance on the explanatory power of a model. Such an approach is intended to achieve a fair trade-off between the needs of performance and interpretability expected from medical diagnosis aid systems. We applied our methodology on a data sample extracted from the ADHD-200 collection, through the development of decision trees which are valued for their readability. Our analysis indicates the relevance of the limbic system for the diagnosis of the disorder. Moreover, while providing explanations that make sense, the resulting decision tree performs favorably given the recent results reported in the literature.

AB  - Aim The objective of this study is to develop accurate machine learning (ML) models for predicting the neurological status at hospital discharge of critically ill patients with hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke and identify the risk factors associated with the neurological outcome of stroke, thereby providing healthcare professionals with enhanced clinical decision-making guidance.Materials and methods Data of stroke patients were extracted from the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) for training and testing sets and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC IV) database for external validation. Four machine learning models, namely gradient boosting classifier (GBC), logistic regression (LR), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and random forest (RF), were used for prediction of neurological outcome. Furthermore, shapley additive explanations (SHAP) algorithm was applied to explain models visually.Results A total of 1,216 hemorrhagic stroke patients and 954 ischemic stroke patients from eICU-CRD and 921 hemorrhagic stroke patients 902 ischemic stroke patients from MIMIC IV were included in this study. In the hemorrhagic stroke cohort, the LR model achieved the highest area under curve (AUC) of 0.887 in the test cohort, while in the ischemic stroke cohort, the RF model demonstrated the best performance with an AUC of 0.867 in the test cohort. Further analysis of risk factors was conducted using SHAP analysis and the results of this study were converted into an online prediction tool.Conclusion ML models are reliable tools for predicting hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke neurological outcome and have the potential to improve critical care of stroke patients. The summarized risk factors obtained from SHAP enable a more nuanced understanding of the reasoning behind prediction outcomes and the optimization of the treatment strategy.

AB  - Definition of the problem Digital health technologies have gained significant importance in recent years. These technologies include symptom checker apps which use algorithms or artificial intelligence to provide users with analyses and recommendations based on their symptom input. Despite their widespread recognition, research shows mixed results regarding the accuracy of these apps, thus, limiting their current utility. The interdisciplinary CHECK.APP project examined the ethical, legal, and social aspects associated with symptom checker apps. Arguments The resulting recommendations presented here are directed towards various stakeholders, including users, physicians, developers, and public institutions. It is crucial to adopt a critical stance towards the use of symptom checker apps, promote health literacy and eHealth literacy, and ensure transparency regarding the data basis and user experiences. Moreover, there is a need for reliable and independent information sources that allow users and physicians to stay informed about current developments in the digitalization of healthcare. At the same time, developers are encouraged to follow clear guidelines on transparency, quality assurance, and accessibility. Additionally, policymakers are recommended to ensure the voluntary use of symptom checker apps and to create conditions that strengthen the health literacy of the population. Conclusion The recommendations presented here outline how symptom checker apps can be used responsibly to maximize potential benefits and minimize risks.

AB  - Background: Recurrence remains the primary cause of death in patients with breast cancer. Although machine learning can efficiently predict the prognosis of breast cancer patients, the black-box nature of the model may result in a lack of evidence for clinicians when making critical decisions. Methods: In this study, our main objective was twofold: (1) to develop a clinical decision support tool for predicting the prognosis of breast cancer and (2) to identify and explore the key factors that influence breast cancer recurrence. To achieve this, we employed an explainable ensemble learning method called Shapley additive explanation (SHAP), which leverages cooperative game theory. Using real-world data from 1629 breast cancer patients, we analyzed and uncovered the key factors associated with breast cancer recurrence. Subsequently, we used these identified factors to create a recurrence prediction model and establish a decision mechanism for the tool. The proposed method not only provides accurate recurrence predictions but also offers transparent explanations for these predictions. Results: By utilizing four key factors, namely, tumor size, clinical stage III, number of lymph node metastases, and age, our decision support tool for predicting breast cancer recurrence achieved significant improvements. The extra-tree model exhibited an increased area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.97, while the Random Forest model demonstrated an improved AUC of 0.96. We also offer a decision mechanism for a recurrence prediction model based on the identified key factors. This transparent and interpretable decision-making process facilitated by our explainable ensemble learning model enhances trust and promotes its applicability in clinical settings. Conclusions: The proposed explainable ensemble learning method shows promising results in predicting breast cancer recurrence, outperforming existing methods with high accuracy and transparency. This advancement has the potential to significantly improve clinical decisionmaking and patient outcomes in breast cancer treatment.

AB  - Deep learning-based support systems have demonstrated encouraging results in numerous clinical applications involving the processing of time series data. While such systems often are very accurate, they have no inherent mechanism for explaining what influenced the predictions, which is critical for clinical tasks. However, existing explainability techniques lack an important component for trustworthy and reliable decision support, namely a notion of uncertainty. In this paper, we address this lack of uncertainty by proposing a deep ensemble approach where a collection of DNNs are trained independently. A measure of uncertainty in the relevance scores is computed by taking the standard deviation across the relevance scores produced by each model in the ensemble, which in turn is used to make the explanations more reliable. The class activation mapping method is used to assign a relevance score for each time step in the time series. Results demonstrate that the proposed ensemble is more accurate in locating relevant time steps and is more consistent across random initializations, thus making the model more trustworthy. The proposed methodology paves the way for constructing trustworthy and dependable support systems for processing clinical time series for healthcare related tasks.

AB  - As the aging US population grows, scalable approaches are needed to identify individuals at risk for dementia. Common prediction tools have limited predictive value, involve expensive neuroimaging, or require extensive and repeated cognitive testing. None of these approaches scale to the sizable aging population who do not receive routine clinical assessments. Our study seeks a tractable and widely administrable set of metrics that can accurately predict imminent (i.e., within three years) dementia onset. To this end, we develop and apply a machine learning (ML) model to an aging cohort study with an extensive set of longitudinal clinical variables to highlight at-risk individuals with better accuracy than standard rudimentary approaches. Next, we reduce the burden needed to achieve accurate risk assessments for those deemed at risk by (1) predicting when consecutive clinical visits may be unnecessary, and (2) selecting a subset of highly predictive cognitive tests. Finally, we demonstrate that our method successfully provides individualized prediction explanations that retain non-linear feature effects present in the data. Our final model, which uses only four cognitive tests (less than 20 minutes to administer) collected in a single visit, affords predictive performance comparable to a standard 100-minute neuropsychological battery and personalized risk explanations. Our approach shows the potential for an efficient tool for screening and explaining dementia risk in the general aging population.

AB  - Background Disease prediction based on electronic health records (EHRs) is essential for personalized healthcare. But it's hard due to the special data structure and the interpretability requirement of methods. The structure of EHR is hierarchical: each patient has a sequence of admissions, and each admission has some co-occurrence diagnoses. However, the existing methods only partially model these characteristics and lack the interpretation for non-specialists. Methods This work proposes a time-aware and co-occurrence-aware deep learning network (TCoN), which is not only suitable for EHR data structure but also interpretable: the co-occurrence-aware self-attention (CS-attention) mechanism and time-aware gated recurrent unit (T-GRU) can model multilevel relations; the interpretation path and the diagnosis graph can make the result interpretable. Results The method is tested on a real-world dataset for mortality prediction, readmission prediction, disease prediction, and next diagnoses prediction. Experimental results show that TCoN is better than baselines with 2.01% higher accuracy. Meanwhile, the method can give the interpretation of causal relationships and the diagnosis graph of each patient. Conclusions This work proposes a novel model-TCoN. It is an interpretable and effective deep learning method, that can model the hierarchical medical structure and predict medical events. The experiments show that it outperforms all state-of-the-art methods. Future work can apply the graph embedding technology based on more knowledge data such as doctor notes.

AB  - Patient experience surveys (PES) are collected by healthcare systems as a surrogate marker of quality and published unedited online for the purpose of transparency, but these surveys may reflect gender biases directed toward healthcare providers. This retrospective study evaluated PES at a single university hospital between July 2016 and June 2018. Surveys were stratified by overall provider rating and self-identified provider gender. Adjectives from free-text survey comments were extracted using natural language processing techniques and applied to a statistical machine learning model to identify descriptors predictive of provider gender. 109,994 surveys were collected, 17,395 contained free-text comments describing 687 unique providers. The mean overall rating between male (8.84, n = 8558) and female (8.80, n = 8837) providers did not differ (p = 0.149). However, highly-rated male providers were more often described for their agentic qualities using adjectives such as "informative," "forthright," "superior," and "utmost" (OR 1.48, p < 0.01)-whereas highly-rated female providers were more often described by their communal qualities through adjectives such as "empathetic," "sweet," "warm," "attentive," and "approachable" (OR 2.11, p < 0.0001). PES may contain gender stereotypes, raising questions about their impact on physicians and their validity as a quality metric which must be balanced with the need for unedited transparency. Future prospective studies are needed to further characterize this trend across geographically and racially diverse healthcare providers.

AB  - Background Coronary heart disease (CHD) has become the leading cause of death and one of the most serious epidemic diseases worldwide. CHD is characterized by urgency, danger and severity, and dynamic treatment strategies for CHD patients are needed. We aimed to build and validate an AI model for dynamic treatment recommendations for CHD patients with the goal of improving patient outcomes and learning best practices from clinicians to help clinical decision support for treating CHD patients. Methods We formed the treatment strategy as a sequential decision problem, and applied an AI supervised reinforcement learning-long short-term memory (SRL-LSTM) framework that combined supervised learning (SL) and reinforcement learning (RL) with an LSTM network to track patients' states to learn a recommendation model that took a patient's diagnosis and evolving health status as input and provided a treatment recommendation in the form of whether to take specific drugs. The experiments were conducted by leveraging a real-world intensive care unit (ICU) database with 13,762 admitted patients diagnosed with CHD. We compared the performance of the applied SRL-LSTM model and several state-of-the-art SL and RL models in reducing the estimated in-hospital mortality and the Jaccard similarity with clinicians' decisions. We used a random forest algorithm to calculate the feature importance of both the clinician policy and the AI policy to illustrate the interpretability of the AI model. Results Our experimental study demonstrated that the AI model could help reduce the estimated in-hospital mortality through its RL function and learn the best practice from clinicians through its SL function. The similarity between the clinician policy and the AI policy regarding the surviving patients was high, while for the expired patients, it was much lower. The dynamic treatment strategies made by the AI model were clinically interpretable and relied on sensible clinical features extracted according to monitoring indexes and risk factors for CHD patients. Conclusions We proposed a pipeline for constructing an AI model to learn dynamic treatment strategies for CHD patients that could improve patient outcomes and mimic the best practices of clinicians. And a lot of further studies and efforts are needed to make it practical.

AB  - BackgroundNeck pain (NP) ranks among the leading causes of years lived with disability worldwide. While spinal manipulation is a common physical therapy intervention for NP, its variable patient responses and inherent risks necessitate careful patient selection. This study aims to develop and validate a machine learning-based prediction model to identify NP patients most likely to benefit from spinal manipulation.MethodsThis multicenter study analyzed 623 NP patients in a retrospective cohort and 319 patients from a separate hospital for external validation, with data collected between May 2020 and November 2024. Treatment success was defined as achieving >= 50% reduction in Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) and >= 30% reduction in Neck Disability Index (NDI) after two weeks of spinal manipulation. We compared data imputation methods through density plots, and conducted delta-adjusted sensitivity analysis. Then employed both Boruta algorithm and LASSO regression to select relevant predictors from 40 initial features, and four feature subsets (Boruta-selected, LASSO-selected, intersection, and union) were evaluated to determine the optimal combination. Nine machine learning algorithms were tested using internal validation (70% training, 30% testing) and external validation. Performance metrics included Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC), accuracy, F1-score, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values. The SHAP framework enhanced model interpretability. Youden's Index was applied to determine the optimal predictive probability threshold for clinical decision support, and a web-based application was developed for clinical implementation.ResultsThe combined LASSO and Boruta algorithms identified nine optimal predictors, with the union feature set achieving superior performance. Among the algorithms tested, the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model demonstrated optimal performance with an AUC of 0.823 (95% CI 0.750, 0.874) in the test set, showing consistency between training (AUC = 0.829) and test performance. External validation confirmed robust performance (AUC: 0.824, accuracy: 0.765, F1 score: 0.76) with satisfactory calibration (Brier score = 0.170). SHAP analysis highlighted the significant predictive value of clinical measurements and patient characteristics. Based on Youden's Index, the optimal predictive probability threshold was 0.603, yielding a sensitivity of 0.762 and specificity of 0.802.

AB  - Machine-learned models are often perceived as "black boxes": they are given inputs and hopefully produce desired outputs. There are many circumstances, however, where human-interpretability is crucial to understand (i) why a model outputs a certain prediction on a given instance, (ii) which adjustable features of that instance should be modified, and finally (iii) how to alter a prediction when the mutated instance is input back to the model. In this paper, we present a technique that exploits the feedback loop originated from the internals of any ensemble of decision trees to offer recommendations for transforming a k-labelled predicted instance into a k'-labelled one (for any possible pair of class labels k, k'). Our proposed algorithm perturbs individual feature values of an instance, so as to change the original prediction output by the ensemble on the so-transformed instance. This is also achieved under two constraints: the cost and tolerance of transformation. Finally, we evaluate our approach on four distinct application domains: online advertising, healthcare, spam filtering, and handwritten digit recognition. Experiments confirm that our solution is able to suggest changes to feature values that help interpreting the rationale of model predictions, making it indeed useful in practice especially if implemented efficiently.

AB  - Objectives : Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is a significant contributor to global mortality and disability, imposing a substantial social and economic burden on individuals and healthcare systems. To enhance the efficient allocation of medical resources and ultimately benefit a larger population, accurate prediction of healthcare costs is crucial. Methods: We developed an interpretable IHD hospitalization cost prediction model that integrates network analysis with machine learning. Specifically, our network-enhanced model extracts explainable features by leveraging a diagnosis-procedure concurrence network and advanced graph kernel techniques, facilitating the capture of intricate relationships between medical codes. Results: The proposed model achieved an R 2 of 0.804 +/- 0.008 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 17,076 +/- 420 CNY on the temporal validation dataset, demonstrating comparable performance to the model employing less interpretable code embedding features (R2: R 2 : 0.800 +/- 0.008; RMSE: 17,279 +/- 437 CNY) and the hybrid graph isomorphism network (R2: R 2 : 0.802 +/- 0.007; RMSE: 17,249 +/- 387 CNY). The interpretation of the network-enhanced model assisted in pinpointing specific diagnoses and procedures associated with higher hospitalization costs, including acute kidney injury, permanent atrial fibrillation, intra-aortic balloon bump, and temporary pacemaker placement, among others. Conclusion: Our analysis results demonstrate that the proposed model strikes a balance between predictive accuracy and interpretability. It aids in identifying specific diagnoses and procedures associated with higher hospitalization costs, underscoring its potential to support intelligent management of IHD.

AB  - Research that makes secondary use of administrative and clinical healthcare databases is increasingly influential for regulatory, reimbursement, and other healthcare decision-making. Consequently, there are numerous guidance documents on reporting for studies that use 'real-world' data captured in administrative claims and electronic health record (EHR) databases. These guidance documents are intended to improve transparency, reproducibility, and the ability to evaluate validity and relevance of design and analysis decisions. However, existing guidance does not differentiate between structured and unstructured information contained in EHRs, registries, or other healthcare data sources. While unstructured text is convenient and readily interpretable in clinical practice, it can be difficult to use for investigation of causal questions, e.g., comparative effectiveness and safety, until data have been cleaned and algorithms applied to extract relevant information to structured fields for analysis. The goal of this paper is to increase transparency for healthcare decision makers and causal inference researchers by providing general recommendations for reporting on steps taken to make unstructured text-based data usable for comparative effectiveness and safety research. These recommendations are designed to be used as an adjunct for existing reporting guidance. They are intended to provide sufficient context and supporting information for causal inference studies involving use of natural language processing- or machine learning-derived data fields, so that researchers, reviewers, and decision makers can be confident in their ability to evaluate the validity and relevance of derived measures for exposures, inclusion/exclusion criteria, covariates, and outcomes for the causal question of interest.

AB  - IntroductionWork-life balance (WLB) is critical to nurse retention and job satisfaction in healthcare. Traditional shift scheduling, characterised by inflexible hours and limited employee control, often leads to stress and perceptions of unfairness, contributing to high turnover rates. AI-based scheduling systems are promoted as a promising solution by enabling fairer and more transparent shift distribution. This study explored the perspectives of nurse leaders, permanent nurses, and temporary nurses on the perceived fairness, transparency, and impact on WLB of AI-based shift scheduling systems, which they had not yet used.MethodsA qualitative study design was used, with focus group (FG) interviews conducted between May and June 2024. FG interviews were conducted with 21 participants from acute hospitals, home care services, and nursing homes between May and June 2024. The interviews were analyzed using the knowledge mapping method, which allowed for a visual representation of key discussion points and highlighted consensus among participants. The discussions centered on five main themes: (1) experiences with current scheduling systems, (2) requirements for work scheduling, (3) fair and participatory work scheduling, (4) requirements for AI in work scheduling, and (5) perceived advantages and disadvantages of AI-based work scheduling.ResultsParticipants reported that current scheduling practices often lacked fairness and transparency, leading to dissatisfaction, particularly among permanent nurses. While temporary staff appreciated the flexibility in their schedules, permanent nurses expressed a desire for more autonomy and fairness in shift allocation. AI-based scheduling has the potential to improve shift equity by objectively managing shifts based on pre-defined criteria, thereby reducing bias and administrative burden. However, participants raised concerns about the depersonalisation of scheduling, emphasising the need for human oversight to consider the emotional and contextual factors that AI systems may overlook.ConclusionAI-based scheduling systems were perceived as having the potential to be beneficial in improving fairness, transparency and WLB for nurses. However, the integration of these systems must be accompanied by careful consideration of the human element and ongoing collaboration with healthcare professionals to ensure that the technology is aligned with organisational needs. By striking a balance between AI-driven efficiency and human judgement, healthcare organisations can improve nurse satisfaction and retention, ultimately benefiting patient care and organisational efficiency.

AB  - The use of intelligent systems in clinical diagnostics has evolved, integrating statistical learning and knowledge-based representation models. Two recent works propose the identification of risk factors for the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The first uses statistical learning to identify indicators associated with different levels of the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). The second paper combines statistical and symbolic inference approaches to obtain risk indicators (Statistical Risk and Symbolic Risk) for a given AHI level. Based on this, in this paper we propose a new intelligent system that considers different AHI levels and generates risk pairs for each level. A learning-based model generates Statistical Risks based on objective patient data, while a cascade of fuzzy expert systems determines a Symbolic Risk using symptom data from patient interviews. The aggregation of risk pairs at each level involves a fuzzy expert system with automatically generated fuzzy rules using the Wang-Mendel algorithm. This aggregation produces an Apnea Risk indicator for each AHI level, allowing discrimination between OSA and non-OSA cases, along with appropriate recommendations. This approach improves variability, usefulness, and interpretability, increasing the reliability of the system. Initial tests on data from 4400 patients yielded AUC values of 0.74-0.88, demonstrating the potential benefits of the proposed intelligent system architecture.

AB  - This study aims to develop a Machine Learning model to assess the risks faced by COVID-19 patients in a hospital setting, focusing specifically on predicting the complications leading to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission or mortality, which are minority classes compared to the majority class of discharged patients. We operate within a multiclass framework comprising three distinct classes, and address the challenge of dataset imbalance, a common source of model bias. To effectively manage this, we introduce the Multi-Thresholding meta-algorithm (MTh), an innovative output-level methodology that extends traditional thresholding from binary to multiclass classification. This methodology dynamically adjusts class probabilities using misclassification costs, making it highly effective in imbalanced datasets. Our approach is further enhanced by integrating the simplicity, transparency, and effectiveness of Bayesian networks to create a robust predictive model. Using patient admission data, the model accurately identifies key risk and protective factors for COVID-19 outcomes. Our findings indicate that certain patient characteristics, such as high Charlson Index and pre-existing conditions, significantly influence the risk of ICU admission and mortality. Moreover, we introduce an explanatory model that elucidates the interrelationships among these factors, demonstrating the influence of therapeutic limits on the overall risk assessment of COVID-19 patients. Overall, our research provides a significant contribution to the field of Machine Learning by offering a novel solution for multiclass classification in the context of imbalanced datasets. This model not only enhances predictive accuracy but also supports critical decision-making processes in healthcare, potentially improving patient outcomes and optimizing clinical resource allocation.

Advanced machine learning techniques, specifically random forest algorithms, in conjunction with regression analysis, were employed to examine the correlations between 45 distinct attributes and respective smart city rankings. The findings reveal that the human development index (HDI) is a key predictor of smart city performance. Furthermore, the regression analysis revealed that elements such as education, healthcare, infrastructure, and digital services significantly enhance achieving higher HDI scores. Similarly, factors like education, sanitation, healthcare, and government transparency are closely associated with successfully implementing sharing platforms. These findings highlight the importance of investing in human capital, developing digital infrastructure, and promoting community engagement to create sustainable and resilient smart cities. Policymakers can utilize these findings to prioritize investments and devise effective strategies to improve their city's ranking.

AB  - Background: Blood pressure (BP) is an essential indicator for human health and is known to be greatly influenced by lifestyle factors, like activity and sleep factors. However, the degree of impact of each lifestyle factor on BP is unknown and may vary between individuals. Our goal is to investigate the relationships between BP and lifestyle factors and provide personalized and precise recommendations to improve BP, as opposed to the current practice of general lifestyle recommendations. Method: Our proposed system consists of automated data collection using home BP monitors and wearable activity trackers and feature engineering techniques to address time-series data and enhance interpretability. We propose Random Forest with Shapley-Value-based Feature Selection to offer personalized BP modeling and top lifestyle factor identification, and subsequent generation of precise recommendations based on the top factors. Result: In collaboration with UC San Diego Health and Altman Clinical and Translational Research Institute, we performed a clinical study, applying our system to 25 patients with elevated BP or stage I hypertension for three consecutive months. Our study results validate our system's ability to provide accurate personalized BP models and identify the top features which can vary greatly between individuals. We also validate the effectiveness of personalized recommendations in a randomized controlled experiment. After receiving recommendations, the subjects in the experimental group decreased their BPs by 3.8 and 2.3 for systolic and diastolic BP, compared to the decrease of 0.3 and 0.9 for the subjects without recommendations. Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of using wearables and machine learning to develop personalized models and precise lifestyle recommendations to improve BP.

AB  - In a pandemic era, rapid infectious disease diagnosis is essential. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) promises sensitive and specific diagnosis including rapid point-of-care detection and drug susceptibility testing. SERS utilizes inelastic light scattering arising from the interaction of incident photons with molecular vibrations, enhanced by orders of magnitude with resonant metallic or dielectric nanostructures. While SERS provides a spectral fingerprint of the sample, clinical translation is lagged due to challenges in consistency of spectral enhancement, complexity in spectral interpretation, insufficient specificity and sensitivity, and inefficient workflow from patient sample collection to spectral acquisition. Here, we highlight the recent, complementary advances that address these shortcomings, including (1) design of label-free SERS substrates and data processing algorithms that improve spectral signal and interpretability, essential for broad pathogen screening assays; (2) development of new capture and affinity agents, such as aptamers and polymers, critical for determining the presence or absence of particular pathogens; and (3) microfluidic and bioprinting platforms for efficient clinical sample processing. We also describe the development of low-cost, point-of-care, optical SERS hardware. Our paper focuses on SERS for viral and bacterial detection, in hopes of accelerating infectious disease diagnosis, monitoring, and vaccine development. With advances in SERS substrates, machine learning, and microfluidics and bioprinting, the specificity, sensitivity, and speed of SERS can be readily translated from laboratory bench to patient bedside, accelerating point-of-care diagnosis, personalized medicine, and precision health.

AB  - Background: Knee osteoarthritis is a prevalent, chronic musculoskeletal disorder that impairs mobility and quality of life. Personalized patient education aims to improve self-management and adherence; yet, its delivery is often limited by time constraints, clinician workload, and the heterogeneity of patient needs. Recent advances in large language models offer potential solutions. GPT-4 (OpenAI), distinguished by its long-context reasoning and adoption in clinical artificial intelligence research, emerged as a leading candidate for personalized health communication. However, its application in generating condition-specific educational guidance remains underexplored, and concerns about misinformation, personalization limits, and ethical oversight remain. Objective: We evaluated GPT-4's ability to generate individualized self-management guidance for patients with knee osteoarthritis in comparison with clinician-created content. Methods: This 2-phase, double-blind, observational study used data from 50 patients previously enrolled in a registered randomized trial. In phase 1, 2 orthopedic clinicians each generated personalized education materials for 25 patient profiles using anonymized clinical data, including history, symptoms, and lifestyle. In phase 2, the same datasets were processed by GPT-4 using standardized prompts. All content was anonymized and evaluated by 2 independent, blinded clinical experts using validated scoring systems. Evaluation criteria included efficiency, readability (Flesch-Kincaid, Gunning Fog, Coleman-Liau, and Simple Measure of Gobbledygook), accuracy, personalization, and comprehensiveness and safety. Disagreements between reviewers were resolved through consensus or third-party adjudication. Results: GPT-4 outperformed clinicians in content generation speed (530.03 vs 37.29 words per min, P<.001). Readability was better on the Flesch-Kincaid (mean 11.56, SD 1.08 vs mean 12.67 SD 0.95), Gunning Fog (mean 12.47, SD 1.36 vs mean 14.56, SD 0.93), and Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (mean 13.33, SD 1.00 vs mean 13.81 SD 0.69) indices (all P<.001), though GPT-4 scored slightly higher on the Coleman-Liau Index (mean 15.90, SD 1.03 vs mean 15.15, SD 0.91). GPT-4 also outperformed clinicians in accuracy (mean 5.31, SD 1.73 vs mean 4.76, SD 1.10; P=.05, personalization (mean 54.32, SD 6.21 vs mean 33.20, SD 5.40; P<.001), comprehensiveness (mean 51.74, SD 6.47 vs mean 35.26, SD 6.66; P<.001), and safety (median 61, IQR 58-66 vs median 50, IQR 47-55.25; P<.001). Conclusions: GPT-4 could generate personalized self-management guidance for knee osteoarthritis with greater efficiency, accuracy, personalization, comprehensiveness, and safety than clinician-generated content, as assessed using standardized, guideline-aligned evaluation frameworks. These findings underscore the potential of large language models to support scalable, high-quality patient education in chronic disease management. The observed lexical complexity suggests the need to refine outputs for populations with limited health literacy. As an exploratory, single-center study, these results warrant confirmation in larger, multicenter cohorts with diverse demographic profiles. Future implementation should be guided by ethical and operational safeguards, including data privacy, transparency, and the delineation of clinical responsibility. Hybrid models integrating artificial intelligence-generated content with clinician oversight may offer a pragmatic path forward.

AB  - Peptide-based therapeutics have emerged as a promising avenue in drug development, offering high biocompatibility, specificity, and efficacy. However, the potential toxicity of peptides remains a significant challenge, necessitating the development of robust toxicity prediction methods. In this study, we introduce ToxiPep, a novel dual-model framework for peptide toxicity prediction that integrates sequence-based contextual information with atomic-level structural features. This framework combines BiGRU and Transformer to capture local and global sequence dependencies while leveraging multi-scale CNNs to extract refined structural features from molecular graphs derived from peptide SMILES representations. A cross-attention mechanism aligns and fuses these two feature modalities, enabling the model to capture intricate relationships between sequence and structural information. ToxiPep outperforms several state-of-the-art tools, including ToxinPred2, CSM-Toxin, PepNet, and ToxinPred3, on both internal and independent test sets. Additionally, interpretability analyses reveal that ToxiPep identifies key amino acids along with their structural features, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms of peptide toxicity. To facilitate broader accessibility, we have also developed a web server for convenient user access. Overall, this framework has the potential to accelerate the identification of safer therapeutic peptides, offering new opportunities for peptide-based drug development in precision medicine.

AB  - Background Recurrent and metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is characterized by a complex therapeutic management that needs to be discussed in multidisciplinary tumor boards (MDT). While artificial intelligence (AI) improved significantly to assist healthcare professionals in making informed treatment decisions for primary cases, an application in the even more complex recurrent/metastatic setting has not been evaluated yet. This study also represents the first evaluation of the recently published LLM ChatGPT 4o, compared to ChatGPT 4.0 for providing therapy recommendations.Methods The therapy recommendations for 100 HNSCC cases generated by each LLM, 50 cases of recurrence and 50 cases of distant metastasis were evaluated by two independent reviewers. The primary outcome measured was the quality of the therapy recommendations measured by the following parameters: clinical recommendation, explanation, and summarization.Results In this study, ChatGPT 4o and 4.0 provided mostly general answers for surgery, palliative care, or systemic therapy. ChatGPT 4o proved to be 48.5% faster than ChatGPT 4.0. For clinical recommendation, explanation, and summarization both LLMs obtained high scores in terms of performance of therapy recommendations, with no significant differences between both LLMs, but demonstrated to be mostly an assisting tool, requiring validation by an experienced clinician due to a lack of transparency and sometimes recommending treatment modalities that are not part of the current treatment guidelines.Conclusion This research demonstrates that ChatGPT 4o and 4.0 share a similar performance, while ChatGPT 4o is significantly faster. Since the current versions cannot tailor therapy recommendations, and sometimes recommend incorrect treatment options and lack information on the source material, advanced AI models at the moment can merely assist in the MDT setting for recurrent/metastatic HNSCC.

KW  - Methods for explanations
KW  - education and learning-related technologies
KW  - explanatory artificial intelligence (YAI)
KW  - SUS
AB  - We propose a new method for generating explanations with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and a tool to test its expressive power within a user interface. In order to bridge the gap between philosophy and humancomputer interfaces, we show a new approach for the generation of interactive explanations based on a sophisticated pipeline of AI algorithms for structuring natural language documents into knowledge graphs, answering questions effectively and satisfactorily. With this work, we aim to prove that the philosophical theory of explanations presented by Achinstein can be actually adapted for being implemented into a concrete software application, as an interactive and illocutionary process of answering questions. Specifically, our contribution is an approach to frame illocution in a computer-friendly way, to achieve user-centrality with statistical question answering. Indeed, we frame the illocution of an explanatory process as that mechanism responsible for anticipating the needs of the explainee in the form of unposed, implicit, archetypal questions, hence improving the user-centrality of the underlying explanatory process. Therefore, we hypothesise that if an explanatory process is an illocutionary act of providing content-giving answers to questions, and illocution is as we defined it, the more explicit and implicit questions can be answered by an explanatory tool, the more usable (as per ISO 9241-210) its explanations. We tested our hypothesis with a user-study involving more than 60 participants, on two XAI-based systems, one for credit approval (finance) and one for heart disease prediction (healthcare). The results showed that increasing the illocutionary power of an explanatory tool can produce statistically significant improvements ( hence with a P value lower than.05) on effectiveness. This, combined with a visible alignment between the increments in effectiveness and satisfaction, suggests that our understanding of illocution can be correct, giving evidence in favour of our theory.

AB  - As an essential research task in artificial intelligence (AI), the estimation of 3D human poses has important application value in virtual reality, medical diagnosis, athlete training and other fields. However, human pose recovery and retargeting require the acquisition of detailed visual data containing private information, which has led to increasing concerns about user privacy and security. Therefore, we build a lightweight framework, called Human Motion Parameters Prediction (HMPP), which can infer the 3D mesh and 3D skeletal joint points of the human body while protecting the privacy of the user. The proposed method successfully reduces or suppresses privacy attributes while ensuring important features to perform human pose estimation. The 2D and 3D joints are used for supervision to improve the interpretability of the model at each stage. In addition, the prediction of the camera's internal parameters is added so that the model can be augmented with projection supervision, thereby using more 2D datasets for training and improving the generalization ability of the model. Finally, the predicted motion parameters are used for 3D reconstruction and motion retargeting. Experiments show that our approach can achieve excellent evaluation results on multiple datasets and avoid inadvertently compromising private and sensitive data.(c) 2023 ISA.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves complex genetic interactions that remain challenging to model computationally. We present a novel deep learning framework integrating Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) data with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to predict gene-disease relationships in AD. Our dual-pathway architecture combines: (1) linear SNP feature processing for individual genetic variants and (2) non-linear GCN analysis of functional gene networks, fused through an optimized integration module. Using rigorously curated data from the GWAS Catalog and AD-specific functional networks (FGN), the model achieved exceptional performance (accuracy: 98.04 +/- 0.32%, AUROC: 0.996). Ablation studies demonstrated statistically significant contributions from both GCN (Delta accuracy - 7.92%, p < 0.001) and SNP pathways (Delta accuracy - 5.74%, p < 0.001), validating their complementary roles in AD prediction. The framework's biological interpretability revealed known AD risk genes (APOE, PSEN1) while identifying novel network-level associations. This study advances precision medicine in neurodegeneration by providing: (i) a validated tool for early genetic risk assessment, and (ii) mechanistic insights into AD pathogenesis through network medicine paradigms. The model's modular design permits adaptation to other complex diseases, with immediate applications in clinical trial stratification and therapeutic target discovery.

TI  - Enhancing diabetes risk prediction through focal active learning and machine learning models
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - To improve the effectiveness of diabetes risk prediction, this study proposes a novel method based on focal active learning strategies combined with machine learning models. Existing machine learning models often suffer from poor performance on imbalanced medical datasets, where minority class instances such as diabetic cases are underrepresented. Our proposed Focal Active Learning method selectively samples informative instances to mitigate this imbalance, leading to better prediction outcomes with fewer labeled samples. The method integrates SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) to quantify feature importance and applies attention mechanisms to dynamically adjust feature weights, enhancing model interpretability and performance in predicting diabetes risk. To address the issue of imbalanced classification in diabetes datasets, we employed a clustering-based method to identify representative data points (called foci), and iteratively constructed a smaller labeled dataset (sub-pool) around them using similarity-based sampling. This method aims to overcome common challenges, such as poor performance on minority classes and limited generalization, by enabling more efficient data utilization and reducing labeling costs. The experimental results demonstrated that our approach significantly improved the evaluation metrics for diabetes risk prediction, achieving an accuracy of 97.41% and a recall rate of 94.70%, clearly outperforming traditional models that typically achieve 95% accuracy and 92% recall. Additionally, the model's generalization ability was further validated on the public PIMA Indians Diabetes DataBase, outperforming traditional models in both accuracy and recall. This approach can enhance early diabetes screening in clinical settings, helping healthcare professionals reduce diagnostic errors and optimize resource allocation.

TI  - RETRACTED: The Promise for Reducing Healthcare Cost with Predictive Model: An Analysis with Quantized Evaluation Metric on Readmission (Retracted Article)
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE ENGINEERING
LA  - English
KW  - HOSPITAL READMISSIONS
KW  - RISK
AB  - Quality of care data has gained transparency captured through various measurements and reporting. Readmission measure is especially related to unfavorable patient outcomes that directly bends the curve of healthcare cost. Under the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program, payments to hospitals were reduced for those with excessive 30-day rehospitalization rates. These penalties have intensified efforts from hospital stakeholders to implement strategies to reduce readmission rates. One of the key strategies is the deployment of predictive analytics stratified by patient population. The recent research in readmission model is focused on making its prediction more accurate. As cost-saving improvements through artificial intelligent-based health solutions are expected, the broad economic impact of such digital tool remains unknown. Meanwhile, reducing readmission rate is associated with increased operating expenses due to targeted interventions. The increase in operating margin can surpass native readmission cost. In this paper, we propose a quantized evaluation metric to provide a methodological mean in assessing whether a predictive model represents cost-effective way of delivering healthcare. Herein, we evaluate the impact machine learning has had on transitional care and readmission with proposed metric. The final model was estimated to produce net healthcare savings at over $1 million given a 50% rate of successfully preventing a readmission.

AB  - Background: In the medical context where polypharmacy is increasingly common, accurately predicting drugdrug interactions (DDIs) is necessary for enhancing clinical medication safety and personalized treatment. Despite progress in identifying potential DDIs, a deep understanding of the underlying mechanisms of DDIs remains limited, constraining the rapid development and clinical application of new drugs. Methods: This study introduces a novel multimodal drug-drug interaction (MMDDI) model based on multi-source drug data and comprehensive feature fusion techniques, aiming to improve the accuracy and depth of DDI prediction. We utilized the real-world DrugBank dataset, which contains rich drug information. Our task was to predict multiple interaction events between drug pairs and analyze the underlying mechanisms of these interactions. The MMDDI model achieves precise predictions through four key stages: feature extraction, drug pairing strategy, fusion network, and multi-source feature integration. We employed advanced data fusion techniques and machine learning algorithms for multidimensional analysis of drug features and interaction events. Results: The MMDDI model was comprehensively evaluated on three representative prediction tasks. Experimental results demonstrated that the MMDDI model outperforms existing technologies in terms of predictive accuracy, generalization ability, and interpretability. Specifically, the MMDDI model achieved an accuracy of 93% on the test set, and the area under the AUC-ROC curve reached 0.9505, showing excellent predictive performance. Furthermore, the model's interpretability analysis revealed the complex relationships between drug features and interaction mechanisms, providing new insights for clinical medication decisions. Conclusion: The MMDDI model not only improves the accuracy of DDI prediction but also provides significant scientific support for clinical medication safety and drug development by deeply analyzing the mechanisms of drug interactions. These findings have the potential to improve patient medication outcomes and contribute to the development of personalized medicine.

AB  - Objective: This study seeks to develop a fully automated method of generating synthetic data from a real dataset that could be employed by medical organizations to distribute health data to researchers, reducing the need for access to real data. We hypothesize the application of Bayesian networks will improve upon the predominant existing method, medBGAN, in handling the complexity and dimensionality of healthcare data.
   Materials and Methods: We employed Bayesian networks to learn probabilistic graphical structures and simulated synthetic patient records from the learned structure. We used the University of California Irvine (UCI) heart disease and diabetes datasets as well as the MIMIC-III diagnoses database. We evaluated our method through statistical tests, machine learning tasks, preservation of rare events, disclosure risk, and the ability of a machine learning classifier to discriminate between the real and synthetic data.
   Results: Our Bayesian network model outperformed or equaled medBGAN in all key metrics. Notable improvement was achieved in capturing rare variables and preserving association rules.
   Discussion: Bayesian networks generated data sufficiently similar to the original data with minimal risk of disclosure, while offering additional transparency, computational efficiency, and capacity to handle more data types in comparison to existing methods. We hope this method will allow healthcare organizations to efficiently disseminate synthetic health data to researchers, enabling them to generate hypotheses and develop analytical tools.
   Conclusion: We conclude the application of Bayesian networks is a promising option for generating realistic synthetic health data that preserves the features of the original data without compromising data privacy.

AB  - Introduction
   Using machine learning techniques, we developed a brief questionnaire to aid neurologists and neuropsychologists in the screening of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia.
   Methods
   With the reduction of the survey size as a goal of this research, feature selection based on information gain was performed to rank the contribution of the 45 items corresponding to patient responses to the specified questions. The most important items were used to build the optimal screening model based on the accuracy, practicality, and interpretability. The diagnostic accuracy for discriminating normal cognition (NC), MCI, very mild dementia (VMD) and dementia was validated in the test group.
   Results
   The screening model (NMD-12) was constructed with the 12 items that were ranked the highest in feature selection. The receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that the area under the curve (AUC) in the test group was 0.94 for discriminating NC vs. MCI, 0.88 for MCI vs. VMD, 0.97 for MCI vs. dementia, and 0.96 for VMD vs. dementia, respectively.
   Discussion
   The NMD-12 model has been developed and validated in this study. It provides healthcare professionals with a simple and practical screening tool which accurately differentiates NC, MCI, VMD, and dementia.

AB  - Theory of Mind (ToM) is the ability to attribute mental states to others, an important component of human cognition. At present, there has been growing interest in the artificial intelligence (AI) with cognitive abilities, for example in healthcare and the motoring industry. Research indicates that infants exhibit early signs in cognitive and social understanding, including some basic abilities related to beliefs, desires, and intentions (BDIs). Thus, the ability to attribute BDIs to others is also crucial for the development of machine ToM. In this article, we review recent progress in machine ToM on BDIs. And we shall introduce the experiments, datasets, and methods of machine ToM on these three aspects, summarize the development of different tasks and datasets in recent years, and compare well-behaved models in aspects of advantages, limitations, and applicable conditions, hoping that this study can guide researchers to quickly keep up with latest trend in this field. Unlike other domains with a specific task and resolution framework, machine ToM lacks a unified instruction and a series of standard evaluation tasks, which make it difficult to formally compare the proposed models. And the existing models still cannot exhibit the same ToM reasoning ability as real humans, lack of transferability, interpretability, few-shot learning, etc. We argue that, one method to address this difficulty is now to present a standard assessment criteria and dataset, better a large-scale dataset covered multiple aspects of ToM. Besides, for developing an AI of ToM, it requires the cooperation of experts from various domains.

AB  - Classification is fundamental in machine learning (ML) applications such as medical diagnosis, financial analysis, and image recognition. Quantum machine learning shows promise in enhancing feature representation and computational efficiency. However, challenges like the noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware limitations, lack of interpretability, and barren plateau issue in parameterized quantum circuits hinder its practical adoption. To address these issues, this work proposes a novel hybrid approach called quantum-enhanced kernel logistic regression (QEKLR) for classification tasks, which combines quantum computation with classical logistic regression (LR) model for improved classification performance. In our QEKLR model, classical data (CD) are first transformed to quantum states (QS) using shallow-depth ZZFeatureMap, and then, fidelity kernel is employed to compute the dot product between feature vectors, resulting in a trained quantum kernel. Subsequently to predict new instances, the quantum kernel is integrated into a classical LR model. We evaluated the proposed model's effectiveness using four datasets: synthetic, Iris, Statlog Heart Disease (HD), and Ecoli datasets achieving accuracy rates of 100%, 100%, 94.87%, and 71%, respectively. In addition, experimental results reveal that the proposed QEKLR model surpasses classical ML models, achieving the MCC 0.88 and AUC-ROC 0.98 for the Statlog HD dataset demonstrating strong classification capability. However, on the Ecoli dataset, the model's performance was comparable to existing ML models, indicating balanced performance across datasets while maintaining robust classification ability and effective class distinctions.

AB  - Many researchers have documented how AI and data driven technologies have the potential to have profound effects on our lives-in ways that make these technologies stand out from those that went before. Around the world, we are seeing a significant growth in interest and investment in AI in healthcare. This has been coupled with rising concerns about the ethical implications of these technologies and an array of ethical guidelines for the use of AI and data in healthcare has arisen. Nevertheless, the question of if and how AI and data technologies can be ethical remains open to debate. This paper aims to contribute to this debate by considering the wide range of implications that have been attributed to these technologies and asking whether current ethical guidelines take these factors into account. In particular, the paper argues that while current ethics guidelines for AI in healthcare effectively account for the four key issues identified in the ethics literature (transparency; fairness; responsibility and privacy), they have largely neglected wider issues relating to the way in which these technologies shape institutional and social arrangements. This, I argue, has given current ethics guidelines a strong focus on evaluating the impact of these technologies on the individual, while not accounting for the powerful social shaping effects of these technologies. To address this, the paper proposes a Multiscale Ethics Framework, which aims to help technology developers and ethical evaluations to consider the wider implications of these technologies.

AB  - Background: The increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical diagnosis and consultation promises benefits such as greater accuracy and efficiency. However, there is little evidence to systematically test whether the ideal technological promises translate into an improved evaluation of the medical consultation from the patient's perspective. This perspective is significant because AI as a technological solution does not necessarily improve patient confidence in diagnosis and adherence to treatment at the functional level, create meaningful interactions between the medical agent and the patient at the relational level, evoke positive emotions, or reduce the patient's pessimism at the emotional level. Objective: This study aims to investigate, from a patient-centered perspective, whether AI or human-involved AI can replace the role of human physicians in diagnosis at the functional, relational, and emotional levels as well as how some health-related differences between human-AI and human-human interactions affect patients' evaluations of the medical consultation. Methods: A 3 (consultation source: AI vs human-involved AI vs human) x 2 (health-related stigma: low vs high) x 2 (diagnosis explanation: without vs with explanation) factorial experiment was conducted with 249 participants. The main effects and interaction effects of the variables were examined on individuals' functional, relational, and emotional evaluations of the medical consultation. Results: Functionally, people trusted the diagnosis of the human physician (mean 4.78-4.85, SD 0.06-0.07) more than medical AI (mean 4.34-4.55, SD 0.06-0.07) or human-involved AI (mean 4.39-4.56, SD 0.06-0.07; P<.001), but at the relational and emotional levels, there was no significant difference between human-AI and human-human interactions (P>.05). Health-related stigma had no significant effect on how people evaluated the medical consultation or contributed to preferring AI-powered systems over humans (P>.05); however, providing explanations of the diagnosis significantly improved the functional (P<.001), relational (P<.05), and emotional (P<.05) evaluations of the consultation for all 3 medical agents. Conclusions:The findings imply that at the current stage of AI development, people trust human expertise more than accurate AI, especially for decisions traditionally made by humans, such as medical diagnosis, supporting the algorithm aversion theory. Surprisingly, even for highly stigmatized diseases such as AIDS, where we assume anonymity and privacy are preferred in medical consultations, the dehumanization of AI does not contribute significantly to the preference for AI-powered medical agents over humans, suggesting that instrumental needs of diagnosis override patient privacy concerns. Furthermore, explaining the diagnosis effectively improves treatment adherence, strengthens the physician-patient relationship, and fosters positive emotions during the consultation. This provides insights for the design of AI medical agents, which have long been criticized for lacking transparency while making highly consequential decisions. This study concludes by outlining theoretical contributions to research on health communication and human-AI interaction and discusses the implications for the design and application of medical AI.

AB  - The healthcare industry faces huge losses due to the mismanagement of insurance transactions. Due to the development of public and private healthcare programs, many citizens receive better medical care benefits. Still, there is a need for financial transparency in these healthcare transactions, which has become a challenge. To ensure the delivery of more effective and higher-quality healthcare services, introducing healthcare fraudulent transactions prevention and detection tools in hospitals is necessary. In this paper, we propose how to inculcate a healthcare transaction monitoring system within an enterprise or organisation. Using machine and deep learning techniques, this research proposes a novel framework for analyzing health insurance data. Due to the complexity of medical information, detecting fraudulent transactions in the industry requires effort. Typically, patients, services, and providers (doctors, hospitals, pharmacies) are the main key elements of the healthcare ecosystem. As fraudsters continue to evolve their methods of conducting fraudulent transactions over time, an evolving fraud detection framework needs to be developed. Therefore, we proposed a framework that can identify fraud at the actor-level and further analyze the identified element (doctor, patient, and services) using an Anomaly transformer to evaluate the behavior of that particular identified element. Actor-level frauds are detected, 50% are at the patient level, 12% are at the service versus doctor level, 13% are at the service versus patient level, and 25% are at the physician level. Further, sequences of these elements are analyzed by the Anomaly transformer. All patient sequences' anomaly scores are generated using a data-driven threshold, and fraudulent sequences are identified. Results of the Speciality-based Rule engine and the Anomaly transformers are compared to identify the anomaly finally. Once the frauds are identified, the proposed architecture enables the management to take disciplinary action against each involved element. The Accuracy of the proposed framework is 97%, The experimental results are validated using the insurance data of local hospital employees, and the domain expert has validated the detected fraud cases.

AB  - ObjectiveThis study aimed to identify phenotypic clinical features associated with acute kidney injury (AKI) to predict non-recovery from AKI at hospital discharge using electronic health record data. MethodsData for hospitalized patients in the AKI Recovery Evaluation Study were derived from a large healthcare delivery system in Taiwan between January 2011 and December 2017. Living patients with AKI non-recovery were used to derive and validate multiple predictive models. In total, 64 candidates variables, such as demographic characteristics, comorbidities, healthcare services utilization, laboratory values, and nephrotoxic medication use, were measured within 1 year before the index admission and during hospitalization for AKI. ResultsAmong the top 20 important features in the predictive model, 8 features had a positive effect on AKI non-recovery prediction: AKI during hospitalization, serum creatinine (SCr) level at admission, receipt of dialysis during hospitalization, baseline comorbidity of cancer, AKI at admission, baseline lymphocyte count, baseline potassium, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. The predicted AKI non-recovery risk model using the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve statistic of 0.807, discrimination with a sensitivity of 0.724, and a specificity of 0.738 in the temporal validation cohort. ConclusionThe machine learning model approach can accurately predict AKI non-recovery using routinely collected health data in clinical practice. These results suggest that multifactorial risk factors are involved in AKI non-recovery, requiring patient-centered risk assessments and promotion of post-discharge AKI care to prevent AKI complications.

AB  - Human skin functions not only as a barrier but also as a sensitive interface responding to environmental stimuli. Skin-attachable conductive materials are gaining increasingly attention in the field of on-skin electronics for applications in health monitoring and human-machine interfaces (HMIs). However, achieving both low modulus and low hysteresis in skin-attachable conductive materials remains challenging. Herein, a skin-like transparent, low-hysteresis, and highly conductive ionogel for human motion monitoring and deep-learning assisted human-machine interface is introduced. The ionogel demonstrates low modulus (5.08 kPa), superior transparency (>92% in the visible range), low hysteresis (<3%), super adhesive and outstanding conductivity (up to 0.86 S/m at 20 degrees C). The ionogel based sensors demonstrate outstanding sensing sensitivity for human motion monitoring and biopotential detecting. In addition, the ionogel can be integrated in an HMI for handwriting recognition. The 1D-ResNet algorithm is developed for handwriting recognition, achieving an accuracy of 98.13%. It is believe that the ionogels with both low modulus and low hysteresis have great potential for wearable electronics in healthcare monitoring and HMIs in the future.

AB  - Open artificial intelligence (A.I.) applications, including ChatGPT, are gaining recognition across diverse research domains, including healthcare, due to their effective handling of inquiries related to A.I. implementation in healthcare. Despite the growing use of blockchain technology in healthcare systems, existing research struggles with storage limitations, computational efficiency, and scalability issues. Therefore, an optimized approach is required to address these critical challenges, including ethical risks. This study explores the synergistic potential of ChatGPT's integration with blockchain technology. This study used a mixed methods approach. Content analysis was used to analyze the qualitative and quantitative data generated by the ChatGPT application. The Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) strategy is used to compress the proposed versions of smart contracts. Code metrics are used to evaluate original and compressed versions of smart contracts. The research identifies seven primary overhead challenges in BCT, with maintenance cost being a less-explored aspect. The BPE's compression results show that 23%-26% of data size was reduced in compressed smart contract versions. Moreover, the study's results show 32.5% and 35% performance improvement in two compressed versions of smart contracts, respectively. The study findings showed that ChatGPT removed the redundant checks by simplifying variable names and adjusting spacing for better smart contracts. Ethical implications are recognized, including privacy, biases, transparency, and academic integrity. ChatGPT demonstrates synergistic capabilities when integrated with BCT. The proposed research is better at overcoming overheads in blockchain-based healthcare systems than the existing works. ChatGPT holds promise in addressing overhead challenges in healthcare BCT. Its potential role in healthcare presents valuable applications to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of BCT in the healthcare domain.

AB  - Background A huge amount of research is carried out nowadays in Artificial Intelligence to propose automated ways to analyse medical data with the aim to support doctors in delivering medical diagnoses. However, a main issue of these approaches is the lack of transparency and interpretability of the achieved results, making it hard to employ such methods for educational purposes. It is therefore necessary to develop new frameworks to enhance explainability in these solutions.Results In this paper, we present a novel full pipeline to generate automatically natural language explanations for medical diagnoses. The proposed solution starts from a clinical case description associated with a list of correct and incorrect diagnoses and, through the extraction of the relevant symptoms and findings, enriches the information contained in the description with verified medical knowledge from an ontology. Finally, the system returns a pattern-based explanation in natural language which elucidates why the correct (incorrect) diagnosis is the correct (incorrect) one. The main contribution of the paper is twofold: first, we propose two novel linguistic resources for the medical domain (i.e, a dataset of 314 clinical cases annotated with the medical entities from UMLS, and a database of biological boundaries for common findings), and second, a full Information Extraction pipeline to extract symptoms and findings from the clinical cases and match them with the terms in a medical ontology and to the biological boundaries. An extensive evaluation of the proposed approach shows the our method outperforms comparable approaches.Conclusions Our goal is to offer AI-assisted educational support framework to form clinical residents to formulate sound and exhaustive explanations for their diagnoses to patients.

AB  - Induction of the labour process is an extraordinarily common procedure used in some pregnancies. Obstetricians face the need to end a pregnancy, for medical reasons usually (maternal or fetal requirements) or less frequently, social (elective inductions for convenience). The success of induction procedure is conditioned by a multitude of maternal and fetal variables that appear before or during pregnancy or birth process, with a low predictive value. The failure of the induction process involves performing a caesarean section. This project arises from the clinical need to resolve a situation of uncertainty that occurs frequently in our clinical practice. Since the weight of clinical variables is not adequately weighted, we consider very interesting to know a priori the possibility of success of induction to dismiss those inductions with high probability of failure, avoiding unnecessary procedures or postponing end if possible. We developed a predictive model of induced labour success as a support tool in clinical decision making. Improve the predictability of a successful induction is one of the current challenges of Obstetrics because of its negative impact. The identification of those patients with high chances of failure, will allow us to offer them better care improving their health outcomes (adverse perinatal outcomes for mother and newborn), costs (medication, hospitalization, qualified staff) and patient perceived quality. Therefore a Clinical Decision Support System was developed to give support to the Obstetricians. In this article, we had proposed a robust method to explore and model a source of clinical information with the purpose of obtaining all possible knowledge. Generally, in classification models are difficult to know the contribution that each attribute provides to the model. We had worked in this direction to offer transparency to models that may be considered as black boxes. The positive results obtained from both the information recovery system and the predictions and explanations of the classification show the effectiveness and strength of this tool.

AB  - Objective: Delirium is a common and acute neuropsychiatric syndrome that requires timely intervention to prevent its associated morbidity and mortality. Yet, its diagnosis and symptoms are often overlooked due to its variable clinical presentation and fluctuating nature. Thus, in this study, we address the barriers to delirium diagnosis by utilizing a machine learning-based predictive algorithm for incident delirium that relies on archived electronic health records (EHRs) data. Methods: We used the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) database to create a detailed dataset for identifying delirium in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Our approach involved training machine learning models on this dataset to pinpoint critical clinical features for delirium detection. These features were then refined and applied to non-ICU patients using EHRs from the American University of Beirut Medical Center (AUBMC). Results: Our study assessed machine learning models like Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Categorical Boosting (CatBoost), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Random Forest (RF), Neural Oblivious Decision Ensembles (NODE), and Logistic Regression (LR), highlighting superior delirium detection in diverse clinical settings. The CatBoost model excelled in ICU environments with an F1 Score of 89.2%, while XGBoost performed best in general hospital settings with a 75.4% F1 Score. Interpretations using Tabular Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) revealed critical indicators such as prothrombin time and hematocrit levels, enhancing model transparency and clinical applicability. These clinical insights help differentiate the delirium predictors between ICU patients, who are often sensitive to various factors. Conclusion: The proposed predictive algorithm improves delirium detection rates and streamlines efficiency in hospital electronic systems, thereby enabling prompt interventions to prevent delirium progression and associated complications. The clinical indicators for delirium that we identified in general hospital settings and ICU can greatly help healthcare professionals identify potential causes of delirium and reduce misdiagnosis.

AB  - Traditional optoelectronic devices without stretchable performance could be limited for substrates with irregular shape. Therefore, it is urgent to explore a new generation of flexible, stretchable, and low-cost intelligent vehicles as visual display and storage devices, such as hydrogels. In the investigation, a novel photochromic hydrogel was developed by introducing the negatively charged ammonium molybdate as a photochromic unit into polyacrylamide via ionic and covalent cross-linking. The hydrogel exhibited excellent properties of low cost, easy preparation, stretchable deformation, fatigue resistance, high transparency, and second-order response to external signals. Moreover, the photochromic and fading process of hydrogels could be precisely controlled and repeated under the irradiation of UV light and exposure of oxygen at different time and temperature. The photochromic hydrogel could be considered applied for artificial intelligence system, wearable healthcare device, and flexible memory device. Therefore, the strategy for designing a soft photochromic material would open a new direction to manufacture flexible and stretchable devices.

AB  - The expanding number of low cost sensors and smart devices drives the internet-of-things (IoT) ecosystem of the future. These sensing devices are connected to the internet for information exchange. The location and positioning of these nodes is very important information required in vast range of location based services like smart homes, smart healthcare, environmental monitoring, personal navigation and smart transportation. This paper presents an intelligent solution for node localization in a 6G enabled IoT network. An indoor communication network scenario is proposed in which reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are installed to locate the sensor nodes operating in that network. The performance evaluation of the proposed scheme is carried out with optimum number of reflecting elements and optimum phase shifts. It is observed that optimized RISs with 100 reflecting elements improve the estimated localization error by 7.4% over non-optimum RISs. Also, the minimum gain of 6% in localization error is offered using equal phase shifts over random phase shifts. Further, the effect of channel conditions on the average estimation error in node locations is also elaborated. In the end, the explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) empowered indoor localization is discussed as a use case scenario and the performance comparison of the algorithms is evaluated.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This educational article explores the convergence of open science practices and traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine (TCIM), shedding light on the potential benefits and challenges of open science for the development, dissemination, and implementation of evidence-based TCIM. We emphasize the transformative shift in medical science towards open and collaborative practices, highlighting the limited application of open science in TCIM research despite its growing acceptance among patients. We define open science practices and discuss those that are applicable to TCIM, including: study registration; reporting guidelines; data, code and material sharing; preprinting; publishing open access; and reproducibility/replication studies. We explore the benefits of open science in TCIM, spanning improved research quality, increased public trust, accelerated innovation, and enhanced evidence-based decision-making. We also acknowledge challenges such as data privacy concerns, limited resources, and resistance to cultural change. We propose strategies to overcome these challenges, including ethical guidelines, education programs, funding advocacy, interdisciplinary dialogue, and patient engagement. Looking to the future, we envision the maturation of open science in TCIM, the development of TCIM-specific guidelines for open science practices, advancements in data sharing platforms, the integration of open data and artificial intelligence in TCIM research, and changes in the context of policy and regulation. We foresee a future where open science in TCIM leads to a better evidence base, informed decision-making, interdisciplinary collaboration, and transformative impacts on healthcare and research methodologies, highlighting the promising synergy between open science and TCIM for holistic, evidence-based healthcare solutions.

AB  - Advancing the quality of healthcare for senior citizens with chronic conditions is of great social relevance. To better manage chronic conditions, objective, convenient, and inexpensive wearable sensor -based information systems (IS) have been increasingly used by researchers and practitioners. However, existing models often focus on a single aspect of chronic conditions and are often "black boxes" with limited interpretability. In this research, we adopt the computational design science paradigm and propose a novel adversarial attention-based deep multisource multitask learning (AADMML) framework. Drawing upon deep learning, multitask learning, multisource learning, attention mechanism, and adversarial learning, AADMML addresses limitations with existing wearable sensor-based chronic condition severity assessment methods. Choosing Parkinson's disease (PD) as our test case because of its prevalence and societal significance, we conduct benchmark experiments to evaluate AADMML against state-of-the-art models on a large-scale dataset containing thousands of instances. We present three case studies to demonstrate the practical utility and economic benefits of AADMML and by applying it to detect early-stage PD. We discuss how our work is related to the IS knowledge base and its practical implications. This work can contribute to improved life quality for senior citizens and advance IS research in mobile health analytics.

AB  - Introduction Transparency and traceability are essential for establishing trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI). The lack of transparency in the data preparation process is a significant obstacle in developing reliable AI systems which can lead to issues related to reproducibility, debugging AI models, bias and fairness, and compliance and regulation. We introduce a formal data preparation pipeline specification to improve upon the manual and error-prone data extraction processes used in AI and data analytics applications, with a focus on traceability.Methods We propose a declarative language to define the extraction of AI-ready datasets from health data adhering to a common data model, particularly those conforming to HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR). We utilize the FHIR profiling to develop a common data model tailored to an AI use case to enable the explicit declaration of the needed information such as phenotype and AI feature definitions. In our pipeline model, we convert complex, high-dimensional electronic health records data represented with irregular time series sampling to a flat structure by defining a target population, feature groups and final datasets. Our design considers the requirements of various AI use cases from different projects which lead to implementation of many feature types exhibiting intricate temporal relations.Results We implement a scalable and high-performant feature repository to execute the data preparation pipeline definitions. This software not only ensures reliable, fault-tolerant distributed processing to produce AI-ready datasets and their metadata including many statistics alongside, but also serve as a pluggable component of a decision support application based on a trained AI model during online prediction to automatically prepare feature values of individual entities. We deployed and tested the proposed methodology and the implementation in three different research projects. We present the developed FHIR profiles as a common data model, feature group definitions and feature definitions within a data preparation pipeline while training an AI model for "predicting complications after cardiac surgeries".Discussion Through the implementation across various pilot use cases, it has been demonstrated that our framework possesses the necessary breadth and flexibility to define a diverse array of features, each tailored to specific temporal and contextual criteria.

AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to identify reliable risk factors for the development of Vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VaIN) within two years after the conization for high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL). We developed a prediction model to predict the risk of VaIN based on preoperative and follow-up data. Methods: We collected 5358 patients who underwent conization for HSIL, of whom 99 developed VaIN within two years after conization. We selected 495 patients as the control group by randomly pairing them 1:5, and were randomly divided into development and validation cohorts at a ratio 7:3. Random Forest (RF), Lasso, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) were employed to identify the most influential variables in the model development dataset. The optimal variables selected through this process were then used for model construction. Subsequently, four machine learning models were developed, and their performance was evaluated using metrics including sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, area under the curve (AUC), and the F1 score. To enhance interpretability, the prediction process was visualized using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). Finally, the model was deployed as a web-based clinical decision support system for practical clinical applications. Results: Five key clinical predictive variables were identified: age, transformation zone (TZ) type, presence of VaIN before conization, follow-up cytology after conization, and follow-up HPV after conization. The optimal model demonstrated strong predictive performance, achieving AUC of 0.910 (95% CI: 0.854-0.966) in the internal validation cohort and 0.905 (95% CI: 0.859-0.951) in the external validation cohort. Conclusion: We established a practical and accurate prediction model deployed in the network application to predict the occurrence of VaIN within two years after conization in patients with HSIL. This tool can facilitate targeted clinical decision-making for clinicians.

TI  - Exploring factors influencing user perspective of ChatGPT as a technology that assists in healthcare decision making: A cross sectional survey study
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
KW  - ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE
AB  - As ChatGPT emerges as a potential ally in healthcare decision-making, it is imperative to investigate how users leverage and perceive it. The repurposing of technology is innovative but brings risks, especially since AI's effectiveness depends on the data it's fed. In healthcare, ChatGPT might provide sound advice based on current medical knowledge, which could turn into misinformation if its data sources later include erroneous information. Our study assesses user perceptions of ChatGPT, particularly of those who used ChatGPT for healthcare-related queries. By examining factors such as competence, reliability, transparency, trustworthiness, security, and persuasiveness of ChatGPT, the research aimed to understand how users rely on ChatGPT for health-related decision-making. A web-based survey was distributed to U.S. adults using ChatGPT at least once a month. Bayesian Linear Regression was used to understand how much ChatGPT aids in informed decision-making. This analysis was conducted on subsets of respondents, both those who used ChatGPT for healthcare decisions and those who did not. Qualitative data from open-ended questions were analyzed using content analysis, with thematic coding to extract public opinions on urban environmental policies. Six hundred and seven individuals responded to the survey. Respondents were distributed across 306 US cities of which 20 participants were from rural cities. Of all the respondents, 44 used ChatGPT for health-related queries and decision-making. In the healthcare context, the most effective model highlights 'Competent + Trustworthy + ChatGPT for healthcare queries', underscoring the critical importance of perceived competence and trustworthiness specifically in the realm of healthcare applications of ChatGPT. On the other hand, the non-healthcare context reveals a broader spectrum of influential factors in its best model, which includes 'Trustworthy + Secure + Benefits outweigh risks + Satisfaction + Willing to take decisions + Intent to use + Persuasive'. In conclusion our study findings suggest a clear demarcation in user expectations and requirements from AI systems based on the context of their use. We advocate for a balanced approach where technological advancement and user readiness are harmonized.

AB  - Background: As the use of smartphones continues to surge globally, mobile applications (apps) have become a powerful tool for healthcare engagement. Prominent among these are dermatology apps powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI), which provide immediate diagnostic guidance and educational resources for skin diseases, including skin cancer.Objective: This article, authored by the EADV AI Task Force, seeks to offer insights and recommendations for the present and future deployment of AI-assisted smartphone applications (apps) and web-based services for skin diseases with emphasis on skin cancer detection.Methods: An initial position statement was drafted on a comprehensive literature review, which was subsequently refined through two rounds of digital discussions and meticulous feedback by the EADV AI Task Force, ensuring its accuracy, clarity and relevance.Results: Eight key considerations were identified, including risks associated with inaccuracy and improper user education, a decline in professional skills, the influence of non-medical commercial interests, data security, direct and indirect costs, regulatory approval and the necessity of multidisciplinary implementation. Following these considerations, three main recommendations were formulated: (1) to ensure user trust, app developers should prioritize transparency in data quality, accuracy, intended use, privacy and costs; (2) Apps and web-based services should ensure a uniform user experience for diverse groups of patients; (3) European authorities should adopt a rigorous and consistent regulatory framework for dermatology apps to ensure their safety and accuracy for users.Conclusions: The utilisation of AI-assisted smartphone apps and web-based services in diagnosing and treating skin diseases has the potential to greatly benefit patients in their dermatology journeys. By prioritising innovation, fostering collaboration and implementing effective regulations, we can ensure the successful integration of these apps into clinical practice.

AB  - Antibiotic resistance, particularly among Gram-negative bacteria, poses a significant healthcare challenge due to their ability to evade antibiotic action through various mechanisms. In this study, we explore the prediction of small molecule accumulation in Gram-negative bacteria by using machine learning techniques enhanced with statistical descriptors derived from molecular dynamics simulations. We begin by identifying a minimal set of molecular descriptors that maximize the model's predictive power while preserving human interpretability. We optimize model accuracy, precision, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve through an iterative process. We demonstrate that the inclusion of statistical descriptors significantly improves model performance across various prediction metrics. Particularly, the addition of statistical descriptors related to dipole moment and minimum projection radius enhances the model's predictive capabilities, shedding light on the physicochemical properties crucial for small molecule accumulation. Our findings highlight the importance of considering statistical moments beyond mean values in predictive modeling and suggest avenues for future research. Overall, our study provides insights into the complex dynamics of antibiotic accumulation in Escherichia coli bacterial cells, generalizable to other Gram-negative species, offering a promising approach for the discovery of effective antibacterial agents, identifying new hits, and improving them to define effective lead agents.

AB  - Healthcare big data provides trajectory data on chronic disease onset, progression, and outcomes, essential for understanding metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) patient health dynamics. However, constructing explainable predictive models for MAFLD using longitudinal healthcare big data remains challenging due to its complexity. While several high-performance machine learning models have shown promise, their "black box" nature limits interpretability and trust among clinical healthcare professionals. Most studies also rely on cross-sectional data, which lacks the depth of longitudinal data, hindering accurate health status tracking. This paper proposes an intelligent MAFLD prediction system integrating temporal association rules (TARs) through a "human-in-the-loop" approach. By analyzing TARs that capture disease dynamics, the system incorporates high-quality domain knowledge into its predictive model. To enhance explainability, we use the SHapley Additive exPlanations framework alongside clinically significant TARs. The system's effectiveness was validated on real-world data, showing improved MAFLD outcome prediction. Sensitivity analysis identified optimal TARs and robust model configurations. Finally, the online-deployed explainable prototype system demonstrates potential to boost trust and adoption among clinical healthcare professionals. Additionally, the system's effectiveness and their willingness to use it were further evaluated through the "human-on-the-loop" method. These findings suggest the system could serve as a valuable tool for clinical applications and advance information systems design.

TI  - Predictive analytics for thyroid cancer recurrence: a feature selection and data balancing approach
T2  - EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL-SPECIAL TOPICS
LA  - English
AB  - Thyroid cancer recurrence presents considerable challenges in clinical practice, underscoring the need for accurate predictive models to guide timely interventions. This study introduces a hybrid machine learning (ML) framework that combines data balancing and feature selection to enhance recurrence prediction. Utilizing the Differentiated Thyroid Cancer Recurrence dataset, the framework evaluates the performance of nine distinct ML classifiers through an 80:20 stratified train-test split and stratified 5-fold cross-validation. Among the evaluated models, ensemble methods-particularly Random Forest and Bagging-demonstrate superior performance on SMOTE-balanced data, achieving 98.7%\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$98.7\%$$\end{document} accuracy and 95.5%\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$95.5\%$$\end{document} recall, and outperforming previously reported methods. Statistical analyses further confirm that the impact of feature selection techniques varies depending on classifier architecture. Overall, the proposed framework illustrates that combining data balancing with informed feature selection significantly enhances predictive performance and contributes to the development of reliable decision-support systems for the early detection of thyroid cancer recurrence. The framework's interpretability and robustness underscore its potential for integration into clinical decision-support systems, enabling early recurrence detection and facilitating personalized treatment strategies. These findings are also applicable to other imbalanced medical datasets.

AB  - Decision trees have the particularity of being machine learning models that are visually easy to interpret and understand. Therefore, they are primarily suited for sensitive domains like medical diagnosis, where decisions need to be explainable. However, if used on complex problems, then decision trees can become large, making them hard to grasp. In addition to this aspect, when learning decision trees, it may be necessary to consider a broader class of constraints, such as the fact that two variables should not be used in a single branch of the tree. This motivates the need to enforce constraints in learning algorithms of decision trees. We propose a survey of works that attempted to solve the problem of learning decision trees under constraints. Our contributions are fourfold. First, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey that deals with constraints on decision trees. Second, we define a flexible taxonomy of constraints applied to decision trees and methods for their treatment in the literature. Third, we benchmark state-of-the art depth-constrained decision tree learners with respect to predictive accuracy and computational time. Fourth, we discuss potential future research directions that would be of interest for researchers who wish to conduct research in this field.

AB  - Significant changes in brain morphology occur during the third trimester of gestation. The capability of deep learning in leveraging these morphological features has enhanced the accuracy of brain age predictions for this critical period. Yet, the opaque nature of deep learning techniques, often described as "black box" approaches, limits their interpretability, posing challenges in clinical applications. Traditional interpretable methods developed for computer vision and natural language processing may not directly translate to the distinct demands of neuroimaging. In response, our research evaluates the effectiveness and adaptability of two interpretative methods-regional age prediction and the perturbation-based saliency map approach-for predicting the brain age of neonates. Analyzing 664 T1 MRI scans with the NEOCIVET pipeline to extract brain surface and cortical features, we assess how these methods illuminate key brain regions for age prediction, focusing on technical analysis with clinical insight. Through a comparative analysis of the saliency index (SI) with relative brain age (RBA) and the examination of structural covariance networks, we uncover the saliency index's enhanced ability to pinpoint regions vital for accurate indication of clinical factors. Our results highlight the advantages of perturbation techniques in addressing the complexities of medical data, steering clinical interventions for premature neonates towards more personalized and interpretable approaches. This study not only reveals the promise of these methods in complex medical scenarios but also offers a blueprint for implementing more interpretable and clinically relevant deep learning models in healthcare settings.

AB  - Objective: Delirium in cancer patients presents a significant clinical challenge, often leading to increased mortality, prolonged hospital stays, and higher healthcare costs. This study aimed to develop an interpretable and generalizable machine learning (ML) model for early prediction of mortality risk in cancer patients with delirium. Methods: A retrospective cohort study design was employed, utilizing data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Five ML models were subsequently constructed and evaluated. Results: A total of 1893 cancer patients with delirium were included in the analysis, of whom 685 (36.2%) died within 28 days who were admitted to the intensive care unit at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2008 and 2022. The Category Boosting (CatBoost) algorithm outperformed other ML models, achieving the highest area under the curve (AUC) on both training and validation datasets. Its robustness was supported by a bias-corrected performance curve closely aligned with the ideal line and the greatest net benefit in decision curve analysis across all threshold probabilities (0-1). The top five predictors of 28-day mortality were high Glasgow Coma Scale and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores, use of antibiotics, propofol, and vasopressors. Conclusions: This study developed an optimal and explainable ML model for predicting 28-day mortality in cancer patients with delirium. The CatBoost algorithm demonstrated stable and robust performance, and interpretability analysis highlighted key predictors. These findings may aid early clinical decision-making and targeted interventions for this high-risk population.

AB  - Objective: The objective of the study was to establish an AI-driven decision support system by identifying the most important features in the severity of disease for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with Mechanical Ventilation (MV) requirement, ICU, and InterMediate Care Unit (IMCU) admission for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in South Florida. The features implicated in the risk factors identified by the model interpretability can be used to forecast treatment plans faster before critical conditions exacerbate. Methods: We analyzed eHR data from 5371 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from South Florida Memorial Healthcare Systems admitted between March 2020 and January 2021 to predict the need for ICU with MV, ICU, and IMCU admission. A Random Forest classifier was trained on patients' data augmented by SMOTE, collected at hospital admission. We then compared the importance of features utilizing different model interpretability analyses, such as SHAP, MDI, and Permutation Importance. Results: The models for ICU with MV, ICU, and IMCU admission identified the following factors overlapping as the most important predictors among the three outcomes: age, race, sex, BMI, diarrhea, diabetes, hypertension, early stages of kidney disease, and pneumonia. It was observed that individuals over 65 years ('older adults'), males, current smokers, and BMI classified as 'overweight' and 'obese' were at greater risk of severity of illness. The severity was intensified by the co-occurrence of two interacting features (e.g., diarrhea and diabetes). Conclusions: The top features identified by the models' interpretability were from the 'sociodemographic characteristics', 'pre-hospital comorbidities', and 'medications' categories. However, 'pre-hospital comorbidities' played a vital role in different critical conditions. In addition to individual feature importance, the feature interactions also provide crucial information for predicting the most likely outcome of patients' conditions when urgent treatment plans are needed during the surge of patients during the pandemic.

AB  - Real-time Electrocardiogram (ECG) anomaly detection is critical for accurate diagnosis and timely intervention in cardiac disorders. Existing models, such as CNNs and LSTMs, often struggle with long-range dependencies, generalization across multiple ECG patterns, and real-time inference with minimal latency. To address these limitations, we propose DeepECG-Net. This hybrid transformer-based deep learning model integrates CNNs and transformer architectures for enhanced feature representation and global dependency capture in ECG anomaly detection. Unlike conventional CNNs, which fail to handle long-term sequence dependencies, or LSTMs, which incur high computational costs, DeepECG-Net leverages a multi-head self-attention mechanism to learn both local and global ECG signal variations efficiently. This results in reduced computational overhead, improved interpretability, and superior real-time detection capabilities. DeepECG-Net achieves 98.2% accuracy with a hierarchical embedding strategy, outperforming ECGNet (88%) and LSTM models (90%). It also demonstrates significant signal reconstruction improvements, with SNR rising from 5.2 dB to 14.5 dB and MSE reducing from 0.042 to 0.007. Its low memory usage (30 MB) makes it ideal for deploying real-time clinical and wearable device applications. Our model achieves 98.2% precision, 96.8% recall, and 97.5% F1 score, closing the gap between AI-driven healthcare and real-time cardiac monitoring. The model is also extended with a federated learning framework for privacy-preserving distributed ECG anomaly detection, supporting deployment across wearable and clinical edge devices. The model was deployed on a Raspberry Pi 4B with 4 GB RAM, achieving sub-50 ms latency and 30 MB memory usage, making it ideal for real-time applications on standalone wearable platforms.

AB  - Background and Objectives: AI is transforming healthcare, with family doctors at the forefront. As primary care providers, they play a key role in integrating AI into patient care. Despite AI's potential, concerns about trust, data privacy, and physician autonomy persist. Little research exists on family doctors' perspectives. This study investigates the views of Lithuanian family physicians on AI's ethical challenges and benefits, aiming to support responsible implementation. Materials and Methods: A review of the literature was conducted (2015-2025) using Google Scholar, PubMed, and Scopus. This qualitative study explored family physicians' perceptions of AI in Lithuania, focusing on ethics, AI's role, experience, training, and concerns about replacement. Informed consent and ethical guidelines were followed. Results: AI has strong potential in family medicine, automating administrative tasks, improving diagnostic accuracy, and supporting patient autonomy. AI tools, like clinical documentation systems and smart devices save time, allowing physicians to focus on patient care. They also improve diagnostic precision, enabling earlier detection of conditions such as cancer and coronary artery disease. Physicians express concerns about AI's reliability, biases, and data privacy. While AI boosts efficiency, many emphasize the importance of human oversight in decision-making, especially in complex cases. Privacy concerns around health data and the need for stricter regulations are crucial. Lithuanian family physicians generally accept AI as a helpful tool for routine tasks but remain cautious regarding its trustworthiness. Job displacement concerns were not prevalent, with AI seen as a tool to augment rather than replace their role. Successful AI integration requires training, transparency, and ethical guidelines to build trust and ensure patient safety. Conclusions: AI enhances efficiency in family medicine but requires structured training and ethical safeguards to address concerns about data privacy, accountability, and bias.

AB  - ObjectiveTo develop models for prediction of the onset of specific diseases in cats using pet insurance data and to evaluate their predictive performance. Methods Agria Pet Insurance data from almost 550,000 cats (2011 to 2016) were analyzed and used to train predictive mod-els for periodontal disease and skin tumors using breed, sex, and insurance claim history. Random downsampling and 1:1 matching by age, insurance duration, and time at risk balanced the dataset. Variables were then further processed, with random forest and conditional logistic regression used for analysis. Model accuracy was assessed through leave-one-out cross-validation, while variable importance plots, partial dependence plots, and coefficients were used for model interpretation. Results Model accuracy ranged from 81.9% to 88.2% (P < .01, baseline 50%). Key predictors included prior insurance claims for "digestive," "whole body symptom," "skin," and "injury conditions," which may be nonspecific and predictive of various diseases. Maine Coon, Siamese, and Burmese cats were associated with periodontal disease-positive predic-tions, while domestic cats were linked with negative predictions. For skin tumors, Norwegian Forest Cats, Devon Rex and Sphynx cats, and Maine Coon cats were associated with positive predictions, whereas Birman and domestic cats were linked with negative predictions. Conclusions This study presents a method of machine learning predictive analysis on pet insurance data, although more comprehensive medical information and approaches accounting for data characteristics may be necessary to develop clearer predictors. Clinical RelevanceTo prevent or detect these conditions early, veterinarians can use the breed risk results to guide clients, especially those with high-risk breeds, by offering early advice on lifestyle and monitoring.

AB  - Breast milk is essential for infant health, but the transfer of xenobiotic chemicals poses significant risks. Ethical challenges in clinical trials necessitate the use of in vitro predictive models to assess chemical exposure risks in breastfeeding infants. This study introduces an explainable machine learning model to predict the risk of chemical transfer through human milk. Our novel framework integrates ensemble resampling methods with advanced feature selection techniques, addressing data imbalance and enhancing predictive accuracy. The balanced random forest classifier, optimized using the genetic algorithm for feature selection, achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.8708 and an accuracy of 82.67 % on the internal test set, with an accuracy of 86.36 % on the external validation set. The integration of the SHapley Additive exPlanations approach provided deeper insights by revealing how specific chemical properties influence the transfer of high-risk compounds into breast milk. This enhanced interpretability offers a clearer understanding of the associated risks and informs strategies for their mitigation. Structural alert analysis further identified molecular fragments linked to high-risk chemicals, enabling targeted risk assessments. Additionally, the model was applied to evaluate the transfer risks of FDA-approved drugs from 2019 to 2024, identifying several with high transfer probabilities. To broaden its application, we developed an online prediction tool that offers real-time risk assessments, providing an accessible resource for healthcare professionals and researchers. These contributions present a robust, ethically sound tool for assessing chemical exposure risks in breastfeeding infants, supporting informed decisions on drug use and environmental contaminant exposure.

AB  - Computational phenotyping allows for unsupervised discovery of subgroups of patients as well as corresponding co-occurring medical conditions from electronic health records (EHR). Typically, EHR data contains demographic information, diagnoses and laboratory results. Discovering (novel) phenotypes has the potential to be of prognostic and therapeutic value. Providing medical practitioners with transparent and interpretable results is an important requirement and an essential part for advancing precision medicine. Low-rank data approximation methods such as matrix (e.g., nonnegative matrix factorization) and tensor decompositions (e.g., CANDECOMP/PARAFAC) have demonstrated that they can provide such transparent and interpretable insights. Recent developments have adapted low-rank data approximation methods by incorporating different constraints and regularizations that facilitate interpretability further. In addition, they offer solutions for common challenges within EHR data such as high dimensionality, data sparsity and incompleteness. Especially extracting temporal phenotypes from longitudinal EHR has received much attention in recent years. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of low-rank approximation-based approaches for computational phenotyping. The existing literature is categorized into temporal versus static phenotyping approaches based on matrix versus tensor decompositions. Furthermore, we outline different approaches for the validation of phenotypes, that is, the assessment of clinical significance.This article is categorized under:Algorithmic Development > Structure DiscoveryFundamental Concepts of Data and Knowledge > Explainable AITechnologies > Machine Learning

AB  - As an ensemble model that consists of many independent decision trees, random forests generate predictions by feeding the input to internal trees and summarizing their outputs. The ensemble nature of the model helps random forests outperform any individual decision tree. However, it also leads to a poor model interpretability, which significantly hinders the model from being used in fields that require transparent and explainable predictions, such as medical diagnosis and financial fraud detection. The interpretation challenges stem from the variety and complexity of the contained decision trees. Each decision tree has its unique structure and properties, such as the features used in the tree and the feature threshold in each tree node. Thus a data input may lead to a variety of decision paths. To understand how a final prediction is achieved, it is desired to understand and compare all decision paths in the context of all tree structures, which is a huge challenge for any users. In this paper, we propose a visual analytic system aiming at interpreting random forest models and predictions. In addition to providing users with all the tree information, we summarize the decision paths in random forests which eventually reflects the working mechanism of the model and reduces users mental burden of interpretation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our system, two usage scenarios and a qualitative user study are conducted.

AB  - Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, necessitating the development of more accurate and efficient diagnostic tools. This study presents a hybrid approach to heart disease prediction, combining fractional-order dynamics with decision tree algorithms and an interactive graphical user interface (GUI). Fractional-order models allow for a more elaborate representation of the complex physiological processes involved in heart disease, including factors such as cholesterol levels, blood pressure, inflammation, and plaque buildup. By integrating decision trees, a machine learning (ML) method known for its interpretability and efficiency in classification tasks, this approach enhances predictive accuracy. The use of an interactive GUI further enables healthcare professionals to visualize and interact with the model, providing real-time insights into patient risk profiles. The model's fractional-order differential equations (FDEs) account for varying rates of progression in different health parameters, offering a dynamic view of heart disease risk. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the model, which outperforms traditional prediction models in terms of both accuracy and usability. The hybrid framework is intended to serve as a robust tool for clinicians, offering an innovative combination of advanced mathematical modeling and user-friendly machine-learning techniques for heart disease prediction. Our findings show that the decision tree classifier performed well, with 93% accuracy, 95% precision, 90% recall, and an F1-score of 0.92. The model handled non-linear relationships and missing data effectively, achieving an ROC-AUC score of 0.99. Key correlations, such as between ST depression and exercise-induced angina, were identified. Fractional-order simulations revealed how cholesterol, blood pressure, and other factors influenced heart disease risk, reinforcing clinical links through numerical simulations.

AB  - A crucial characteristic of machine learning models in various domains (such as medical diagnosis, financial analysis, or real-time process monitoring) is the interpretability. The interpretation supports humans in understanding the meaning behind every single prediction made by the machine, and enables the user to assess trustworthiness before acting on the predictions. This article presents our work in building an interpretable classification model based on association rule mining and multi-objective optimization. The classification model itself is a rule list, making a single prediction based on multiple rules. The rule list consists of If ... THEN statements that are understandable to humans. We choose these rules from a large set of pre-mined rules according to an interestingness measure which is formulated as a function of basic probabilities related to the rules. We learned the interestingness measure through multi-objective optimization, concentrating on two objectives: the classifier's size in terms of number of rules and prediction accuracy. The model is called MoMAC, "Multi-Objective optimization to combine Multiple Association rules into an interpretable Classification". The experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MoMAC outperforms other existing rule-based classification methods in terms of classification accuracy.

AB  - Due to the excellent efficiency and high interpretability, coupled with the accuracy comparable to deep learning on tabular data, various tree-based models have been widely concerned and succeeded in many fields like medical diagnosis, credit evaluation, and fault detection. However, the model owner may face dilemmas such as compromised privacy and insufficient machine performance when providing tree-based inference services. Therefore, this paper proposes an efficient and privacy-preserving tree-based inference scheme, through which users can enjoy secure, high-accuracy, and transparent outsourcing inference services from one cloud. Specifically, by adopting additive homomorphic encryption as the underlying privacy-preserving technique, we design a suite of perturbation and recovery methods, processing cipher-based inference while masking the inference path. Meanwhile, without additional interactions, users can directly obtain high-accuracy results comparable to non-privacy inference, so the used privacy-preserving methods seem transparent to users. Moreover, through optimizing algorithm design and precalculating partial ciphertexts, the efficiency of our scheme is improved significantly. Formal security analysis demonstrates that our scheme achieves selective security under the honest-but-curious model. Extensive experimental evaluation shows the lossless accuracy, low complexity, and high efficiency of our scheme, which is practical to real-world scenes, especially for large-scale models.

AB  - Rehabilitation behavior recognition is critical for monitoring patient progress and providing feedback during physical therapy. This paper introduces a novel Spatio-Temporal Attention-Augmented Gated Graph Convolutional Network (STA-GGCN) designed to capture the complex dynamics of human motion using skeletal data. The STA-GGCN is specifically designed to capture the complex dynamics of human motion using skeletal data. The proposed model integrates graph-based spatial modeling and gated mechanisms to selectively manage joint interactions. Additionally, a spatio-temporal attention module dynamically identifies critical joints and frames, while recurrent layers model temporal dependencies. We evaluated the STA-GGCN on three benchmark datasets: UPFall, Human3.6M, and Kinetics-Skeleton. The model achieved accuracy scores of 89.14%, 90.82%, and 88.31%, respectively, along with high temporal alignment as measured by Temporal Intersection over Union (tIoU). Comprehensive analyses demonstrate the contributions of individual components, the robustness of the model across datasets, and its interpretability through attention heatmaps and Grad-CAM. Despite its computational overhead and sensitivity to noisy skeletal data, STA-GGCN exhibits strong generalization and interpretability, rendering it suitable for applications in rehabilitation, sports analytics, and human-computer interaction.

AB  - Chronic knee conditions and musculoskeletal (MSK) injuries are prevalent and pose significant challenges to global healthcare systems. Current diagnostic methods, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and X-ray, provide valuable insights but are limited by high costs and the inability to continuously monitor knee health. In response to these challenges, the proposed work makes the following contributions. First, a novel wearable knee health monitoring system is developed, incorporating a flexible composite piezoelectric film that captures subtle patellar displacements as early indicators of knee joint abnormalities. Second, a Bayesian machine learning framework incorporating both expert knowledge and diagnostic data is proposed to address the potential limitations of current machine learning-based diagnostic methods, such as low accuracy and poor interpretability in medical practice. This framework integrates causal discovery algorithms, clinical insights, and medical expertise to identify the key relationships between machine learning models and medical principles, ultimately improving diagnostic accuracy. Finally, the proposed system achieves an 83.3% success rate in distinguishing between healthy, sub-healthy, and unhealthy knee states, outperforming traditional methods with an accuracy improvement of 6.4%-17%. Furthermore, the system integrates a wireless sensor network and user-friendly software, enabling convenient monitoring and diagnosis in both clinical and home settings. The main innovation of this study lies in the design of a wearable sensor network structure based on patellar activity and a medical knowledge-guided Bayesian framework to enable a three-state classification diagnosis, namely, healthy, sub-healthy, and unhealthy. This system is particularly suited for knee health assessments in outpatient clinics, community settings, and home environments.

AB  - ObjectivesAlthough the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is increasing, stakeholder engagement remains poor, particularly relating to understanding parent/carer acceptance of AI tools in paediatric imaging. We explore these perceptions and compare them to the opinions of children and young people (CYAP).Materials and methodsA UK national online survey was conducted, inviting parents, carers and guardians of children to participate. The survey was "live" from June 2022 to 2023. The survey included questions asking about respondents' views of AI in general, as well as in specific circumstances (e.g. fractures) with respect to children's healthcare.ResultsOne hundred forty-six parents/carers (mean age = 45; range = 21-80) from all four nations of the UK responded. Most respondents (93/146, 64%) believed that AI would be more accurate at interpreting paediatric musculoskeletal radiographs than healthcare professionals, but had a strong preference for human supervision (66%). Whilst male respondents were more likely to believe that AI would be more accurate (55/72, 76%), they were twice as likely as female parents/carers to believe that AI use could result in their child's data falling into the wrong hands. Most respondents would like to be asked permission before AI is used for the interpretation of their child's scans (104/146, 71%). Notably, 79% of parents/carers prioritised accuracy over speed compared to 66% of CYAP.ConclusionParents/carers feel positively about AI for paediatric imaging but strongly discourage autonomous use. Acknowledging the diverse opinions of the patient population is vital in aiding the successful integration of AI for paediatric imaging.Critical relevance statementParents/carers demonstrate a preference for AI use with human supervision that prioritises accuracy, transparency and institutional accountability. AI is welcomed as a supportive tool, but not as a substitute for human expertise.Key PointsParents/carers are accepting of AI use, with human supervision.Over half believe AI would replace doctors/nurses looking at bone X-rays within 5 years.Parents/carers are more likely than CYAP to trust AI's accuracy.Parents/carers are also more sceptical about AI data misuse.

AB  - Environmental Sound Classification (ESC) remains a significant challenge due to the dynamic nature of audio data, scarcity of labeled datasets, and the complexity of feature extraction. Existing deep learning approaches, such as CNNs and RNNs, frequently struggle to manage diverse sound features, achieve real-time processing, and provide interpretability and generalization across varied environments. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture, integrating CNNs for spatial feature extraction and LSTMs for temporal sequence modeling, enabling superior classification performance. We also present an improved Patch Transformer model that uses self-attention mechanisms to improve spectro-temporal feature learning even more. To achieve this, we extract Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and transform them into Mel spectrograms so that the models can accurately represent spectro-temporal information for ESC. We incorporate batch normalization, feature representation maps, and transfer learning to enhance the model's accuracy and generalization. Evaluated on the UrbanSound8K and ESC-50 datasets, our model surpasses conventional CNN, RNN, and ANN approaches, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy. The findings demonstrate the importance of hybrid architectures and optimized feature extraction techniques in ESC. This study provides a robust framework to improve environmental sound recognition, with potential applications in smart surveillance, healthcare monitoring, and urban noise analysis.

AB  - In the rapidly evolving landscape of medical imaging, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with clinical expertise offers unprecedented opportunities to enhance diagnostic precision and accuracy. Yet, the "black box" nature of AI models often limits their integration into clinical practice, where transparency and interpretability are important. This paper presents a novel system leveraging the Large Multimodal Model (LMM) to bridge the gap between AI predictions and the cognitive processes of radiologists. This system consists of two core modules, Temporally Grounded Intention Detection (TGID) and Region Extraction (RE). The TGID module predicts the radiologist's intentions by analyzing eye gaze fixation heatmap videos and corresponding radiology reports. Additionally, the RE module extracts regions of interest that align with these intentions, mirroring the radiologist's diagnostic focus. This approach introduces a new task, radiologist intention detection, and is the first application of Dense Video Captioning (DVC) in the medical domain. By making AI systems more interpretable and aligned with radiologist's cognitive processes, this proposed system aims to enhance trust, improve diagnostic accuracy, and support medical education. Additionally, it holds the potential for automated error correction, guiding junior radiologists, and fostering more effective training and feedback mechanisms. This work sets a precedent for future research in AI-driven healthcare, offering a pathway towards transparent, trustworthy, and human-centered AI systems. We evaluated this model using NLG(Natural Language Generation), time-related, and vision-based metrics, demonstrating superior performance in generating temporally grounded intentions on REFLACX and EGD-CXR datasets. This model also demonstrated strong predictive accuracy in overlap scores for medical abnormalities and effective region extraction with high IoU(Intersection over Union), especially in complex cases like cardiomegaly and edema. These results highlight the system's potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy and support continuous learning in radiology.

AB  - Aims Current risk prediction models, such as the Norwegian NORRISK 2, explain only a modest proportion of cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence. This study aimed to develop improved sex-specific models for predicting the 10-year CVD risk as well as sex- and age-specific thresholds for intervention.Methods and results Data from 31 946 participants (40-79 years) without prior CVD were analysed. Data were randomly split into a training set (for estimation) and a test set (for model evaluation). An extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model was used to identify the most important predictive variables. Next, prediction models were developed on the training set for each sex separately using XGBoost and logistic regression. The models were evaluated on the test set using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) and precision recall (PR) curves. Finally, age- and sex-specific thresholds for intervention were explored. All traditional risk factors included in NORRISK 2 and the European SCORE2 model were important predictors for males, but not for females. Potential new risk predictors were identified. The XGBoost model improved CVD risk prediction for males: 0.013- and 0.012-unit increase in ROC-AUC compared with NORRISK 2 and SCORE2, respectively, and 12% and 11% increase in PR-AUC, respectively. For females, neither the XGBoost nor logistic regression model performed significantly better than NORRISK 2 and SCORE2. Age- and sex-specific thresholds showed an improvement in sensitivity compared with NORRISK 2-suggested thresholds.Conclusion By employing statistical learning and incorporating sex-specific risk factors, we propose improved risk prediction models for CVD in males. Implementing sex-specific thresholds for intervention could improve CVD prevention in both men and women.
   The study showed how artificial intelligence can improve the tools to predict the chances of a person experiencing heart disease within 10 years:In addition to traditional factors that can increase the risk for heart disease, such as age, high blood pressure, and smoking, we identified new characteristics separately for men and for women. Being aware of these factors and making lifestyle changes accordingly could mean remaining in good heart health for longer time.We developed new prediction tools separately for men and women, that is, using different risk factors for each sex and different thresholds that suggest when a person is at risk. These new tools make the prediction of having heart disease more precise. Increased precision is very important for doctors to identify persons at risk also when they look apparently healthy and at same time avoid overtreating healthy persons.

AB  - Purpose: The goal of the study described in this protocol is to build a multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) model to predict abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) shrinkage 1 year after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). Methods: In this retrospective observational multicenter study, approximately 1000 patients will be enrolled from hospital records of 5 experienced vascular centers. Patients will be included if they underwent elective EVAR for infrarenal AAA with initial assisted technical success and had imaging available of the same modality preoperatively and at 1-year follow-up (CTA-CTA or US-US). Data collection will include baseline and vascular characteristics, medication use, procedural data, preoperative and postoperative imaging data, follow-up data, and complications. Proposed Analyses: The cohort will be stratified into 3 groups of AAA remodeling based on the maximum AAA diameter difference between the preoperative and 1-year postoperative moment. Patients with a diameter reduction of >= 5 mm will be assigned to the AAA shrinkage group, cases with an increase of >= 5 mm will be assigned to the AAA growth group, and patients with a diameter increase or reduction of <5 mm will be assigned to the stable AAA group. Furthermore, an additional fourth group will include all patients who underwent an AAA-related reintervention within the first year after EVAR, because both the complication and the reintervention might have influenced the state of AAA remodeling at 1 year. The preoperative and postoperative CTA scans will be used for anatomical AAA analysis and biomechanical assessment through semi-automatic segmentation and finite element analysis. All collected clinical, biomechanical, and imaging data will be used to create an AI prediction model for AAA shrinkage. Explainable AI techniques will be used to identify the most descriptive input features in the model. Predicting factors resulting from the AI model will be compared with conventional univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to find the best model for the prediction of AAA shrinkage. The study is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov under the registration number NCT06250998. Clinical Impact This study aims to develop a robust and high-performance AI model for predicting AAA shrinkage one-year after EVAR, with great potential for optimizing both EVAR treatment and follow-up. The model can identify cases with an initially lower chance of early AAA shrinkage, in whom EVAR-treatment could be tailored by including additional preoperative coil embolization, active sac management and/or postoperative tranexamic acid therapy, which have shown to promote AAA shrinkage rate but are too complex and costly to perform in all patients. The model could aid in stratification of post-EVAR surveillance based on the patient's individual risk and possibly decrease follow-up for the 40-50% of patients who will experience AAA sac shrinkage. Overall, the AI prediction model is expected to improve patient survival and decrease the number of reinterventions after EVAR and associated healthcare costs.

AB  - Study Design.Retrospective study.Objectives.The objective of this investigation was to formulate and internally verify a customized machine learning (ML) framework for forecasting cerebrospinal fluid leakage (CSFL) in lumbar fusion surgery. This was accomplished by integrating imaging parameters and using the SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) technique to elucidate the interpretability of the model.Summary of Background Data.Given the increasing incidence and surgical volume of spinal degeneration worldwide, accurate predictions of postoperative complications are urgently needed. SHAP-based interpretable ML models have not been used for CSFL risk factor analysis in lumbar fusion surgery.Methods.Clinical and imaging data were retrospectively collected from 3505 patients who underwent lumbar fusion surgery. Six distinct machine learning models were formulated: extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), Gaussian naive Bayes (GaussianNB), and K-nearest neighbors (KNN) models. Evaluation of model performance on the test dataset was performed using performance metrics, and the analysis was executed through the SHAP framework.Results.CSFL was detected in 95 (2.71%) of 3505 patients. Notably, the XGBoost model exhibited outstanding accuracy in forecasting CSFLs, with high precision (0.9815), recall (0.6667), accuracy (0.8182), F1 score (0.7347), and AUC (0.7343). In addition, through SHAP analysis, significant predictors of CSFL were identified, including ligamentum flavum thickness, zygapophysial joint degeneration grade, central spinal stenosis grade, decompression segment count, decompression mode, intervertebral height difference, Cobb angle, intervertebral height index difference, operation mode, lumbar segment lordosis angle difference, Meyerding grade of lumbar spondylolisthesis, and revision surgery.Conclusions.The combination of the XGBoost model with the SHAP is an effective tool for predicting the risk of CSFL during lumbar fusion surgery. Its implementation could aid clinicians in making informed decisions, potentially enhancing patient outcomes and lowering healthcare expenses. This study advocates for the adoption of this approach in clinical settings to enhance the evaluation of CSFL risk among patients undergoing lumbar fusion.

AB  - Activity recognition via wearable devices plays a crucial role in enhancing user interaction and service personalization within the domain of consumer electronics. Nonetheless, the quest for high precision in activity classification encounters notable hurdles due to the variability in sensor data coupled with the intricate nature of human activities. Prevailing methodologies frequently grapple with challenges such as the inadequate resolution of multicollinearity among features, suboptimal feature engineering, and an imbalanced approach to class imbalances, all of which detrimentally affect the performance of classification models. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel model employing a RandomForestClassifier, augmented with advanced feature engineering and multimodal analysis. This technique innovatively synthesizes a new set of features directly from the raw sensor data, integrating diverse sensor modalities to ameliorate multicollinearity and boost model interpretability significantly. The incorporation of a Class Weight Approach and Gini coefficient formulation further refines the handling of class imbalances. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves exceptional accuracy, precision, and recall metrics, nearing 99.8.

AB  - Objective The aims of this study were to develop and validate interpretable ML models for extended length of stay (eLOS) prediction following endoscopic lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) decompression, and identify modifiable risk factors influencing healthcare costs and recovery. Methods A prospective-retrospective cohort of 350 patients (2019-2025) undergoing single-level endoscopic decompression was analyzed. The eLOS was defined as >9 days via classification and regression tree (CART) analysis. Predictors included demographics (age, BMI), comorbidities (osteoporosis, hypertension), surgical parameters, and hospitalization costs. Seven ML models (XGBoost, Lasso Regression, CNN, etc.) were trained using stratified 70:30 splits, SMOTE balancing, and Bayesian hyperparameter tuning. Model performance was evaluated via AUC-ROC, F1-score, and SHAP interpretability. Results The eLOS group (n = 135) exhibited higher age (56.3 vs. 48.6 years, p < 0.001), osteoporosis (23% vs. 3.7%, p < 0.001), and hypertension (33.3% vs. 14.0%, p < 0.001). Gradient Boosting Machines (AUC = 0.96), XGBoost (AUC = 0.99), and Lasso Regression (AUC = 1.00) outperformed other models, identifying L4/L5 involvement, heart rate, age, osteoporosis, and hypertension as top predictors. Post-cross-validation, CNN (Accuracy = 0.75, AUC = 0.89) and XGB (Accuracy = 0.69, AUC = 0.85) demonstrated robustness. eLOS patients incurred 13% higher costs (p = 0.02). Conclusion This study establishes the first ML-driven framework for eLOS prediction in endoscopic LSS surgery, emphasizing age-related comorbidities over procedural factors. The integration of economic and clinical data enables actionable risk mitigation, supporting value-based care initiatives. Future multicenter studies should validate these models across diverse healthcare systems.

AB  - The extraction of informative features from medical images and the retrieving of similar images from data repositories is vital for clinical decision support systems. Unlike general tasks such as medical image classification and segmentation, retrieval is more reliable in terms of interpretability. However, this task is quite challenging due to the multimodal and imbalanced nature of medical images. Because traditional retrieval methods use hand-crafted feature extraction guided approximate hashing functions, they often have problems capturing the latent characteristics of images. Deep learning based retrieval methods can eliminate drawbacks of hand-crafted feature extraction methods. However, in order for a deep architecture to produce high performance, large-scale datasets containing labeled and balanced samples are required. Since most medical datasets do not have these properties, existing hashing methods are not powerful enough to model patterns in medical images, which have a similar general appearance but subtle differences. In this study, a novel W-shaped contrastive loss (W-SCL) is proposed for skin lesion image retrieval on a dataset whose visual difference between classes is relatively low. We considerably improve the traditional contrastive loss (CL) performance by including label information for very similar skin lesion images. We use two benchmark datasets consisting of general images and two benchmark skin lesion datasets to test the proposed W-SCL performance. In addition, experiments are carried out using various pre-trained CNN and shallow CNN architectures. These extensive experiments reveal that the proposed method improves the mean average precision (mAP) performance by approximately 7% for general image datasets and approximately 12% for skin lesion datasets.

AB  - Cardiac digital twins (CDTs) are personalized virtual representations used to understand complex cardiac mechanisms. A critical component of CDT development is solving the ECG inverse problem, which enables the reconstruction of cardiac sources and the estimation of patient-specific electrophysiology (EP) parameters from surface ECG data. Despite challenges from complex cardiac anatomy, noisy ECG data, and the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem, recent advances in computational methods have greatly improved the accuracy and efficiency of ECG inverse inference, strengthening the fidelity of CDTs. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the methods for solving ECG inverse problems, their validation strategies, their clinical applications, and their future perspectives. For the methodologies, we broadly classify state-of-the-art approaches into two categories: deterministic and probabilistic methods, including both conventional and deep learning-based techniques. Integrating physics laws with deep learning models holds promise, but challenges such as capturing dynamic electrophysiology accurately, accessing accurate domain knowledge, and quantifying prediction uncertainty persist. Integrating models into clinical workflows while ensuring interpretability and usability for healthcare professionals is essential. Overcoming these challenges will drive further research in CDTs.

AB  - Federated Learning (FL) offers a collaborative approach to training machine learning models while preserving data privacy. However, FL faces significant privacy and security challenges, such as identity disclosure and model inference attacks. To this end, we propose a novel Blockchain-Based Framework for Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning (BPPFL), which integrates threshold signature authentication and threshold Paillier encryption with blockchain technology. The BPPFL framework secures participant authentication and protects against internal and external threats, while the blockchain provides an immutable ledger for recording transactions and model updates, ensuring transparency and security. Experimental results show that our framework significantly reduces computation and communication overhead compared to existing methods while maintaining high model accuracy and robust privacy guarantees. Our framework enhances the security and trustworthiness of FL applications, making it suitable for domains like healthcare, finance, and the IoT.

AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), one of the most common sleep disorders globally, is closely linked to brain function. Resting-state electroencephalography (EEG), due to its convenience, cost-effectiveness, and high temporal resolution, serves as a valuable tool for exploring the human brain function. This study utilized a large cohort with 968 participants who joined in 15-minute daytime resting-state EEG acquisition and overnight polysomnography (PSG) monitoring. Participants were categorized into healthy controls and mild, moderate, and severe OSA groups based on apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) derived from PSG data. Resting-state EEG functional connectivity (FC) was estimated using correlation (Corr), coherence (Coh), phase-locking value (PLV), and phase lag index (PLI). Results showed that FC between most nodes increased with the OSA severity, which suggest the potential neural compensation. However, regional decreases emerged in the right central, right frontal, left central, and left parieto-occipital regions. Higher frequency bands exhibited fewer enhanced FC connections. Graph-theoretical analysis revealed reduced centrality, indicating weakened communication hubs and potential topological reorganization. Multivariate analysis with adjustment of age, sex, and BMI, was also used as a feature selection strategy, identified effective FC features of OSA severity (p value < adjusted significance threshold, 2.15e-5). These FC features were used in machine learning models for severity classification and enhanced interpretability. The Corr-based XGBoost model achieved the highest performance, with an accuracy of 0.79 and AUC of 0.90. These findings highlight OSA-related brain function alterations and demonstrate that resting-state EEG FC provides a non-invasive, task-free and interpretable tool for OSA severity classification without disrupting natural sleep.

AB  - The current landscape of medical diagnostics grapples with a critical challenge posed by the limitations of existing meta-learning techniques in interpreting complex representations from limited labeled data, particularly evident in COVID-19 datasets. In response to this gap, our paper introduces a groundbreaking Turning Point (TP) methodology designed to enhance the interpretability of machine learning diagnostics, specifically addressing the shortcomings highlighted in conventional meta-learning approaches. Our Turning Point-based Few-Shot Learning (TPFSL) model goes beyond traditional FSL methods by embracing structured knowledge representation, departing from unstructured metric spaces. We found that our TPFSL model outperformed the state-of-theart models by an average of 4.50% in 1-shot learning and 4.43% in 5-shot learning after conducting extensive benchmarking on the COVCT, SARSCOV2, and SIRM datasets. Across all datasets studied, TPFSL outperforms the ProtoNet benchmark in 1-shot classification by 12.966% and in 5-shot classification by 11.033%. The importance of TP density, the structure of the network, and placement in improving model performance have been shown by a thorough set of ablation investigations; with its revolutionary TPFSL model, which tackles the shortcomings of current meta-learning methods head-on, COVID-19 diagnostic procedures can be made more accurate and valid in clinical situations.

AB  - We propose a BlackBox Counterfactual Explainer, designed to explain image classification models for medical applications. Classical approaches (e.g., , saliency maps) that assess feature importance do not explain how imaging features in important anatomical regions are relevant to the classification decision. Such reasoning is crucial for transparent decision-making in healthcare applications. Our framework explains the decision for a target class by gradually exaggerating the semantic effect of the class in a query image.We adopted a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate a progressive set of perturbations to a query image, such that the classification decision changes from its original class to its negation. Our proposed loss function preserves essential details (e.g., support devices) in the generated images. We used counterfactual explanations from our framework to audit a classifier trained on a chest X-ray dataset with multiple labels. Clinical evaluation of model explanations is a challenging task. We proposed clinically-relevant quantitative metrics such as cardiothoracic ratio and the score of a healthy costophrenic recess to evaluate our explanations. We used these metrics to quantify the counterfactual changes between the populations with negative and positive decisions for a diagnosis by the given classifier.We conducted a human-grounded experiment with diagnostic radiology residents to compare different styles of explanations (no explanation, saliency map, cycleGAN explanation, and our counterfactual explana-tion) by evaluating different aspects of explanations: (1) understandability, (2) classifier's decision justification, (3) visual quality, (d) identity preservation, and (5) overall helpfulness of an explanation to the users. Our results show that our counterfactual explanation was the only explanation method that significantly improved the users' understanding of the classifier's decision compared to the no-explanation baseline. Our metrics established a benchmark for evaluating model explanation methods in medical images. Our explanations revealed that the classifier relied on clinically relevant radiographic features for its diagnostic decisions, thus making its decision-making process more transparent to the end-user.

AB  - Anticipating the trajectory of cranial lesion progression with high precision represents a formidable challenge in neurosurgery, where the capacity for timely and accurate prognostication is indispensable for optimizing patient care strategies. This study introduces an advanced framework underpinned by a Seq2Seq architecture, augmented with a sophisticated temporal attention mechanism specifically designed for the analysis of longitudinal clinical datasets. The proposed architecture seamlessly integrates LSTM networks with Transformer-based components within a dynamic and adaptable decoder, thereby enabling the model to capture both transient fluctuations and enduring trends across complex patient data. To ensure alignment with practical clinical needs, a tailored loss function was developed, emphasizing critical lesion parameters, including volumetric dimensions, morphological complexity, and signal intensity. Rigorous validation was conducted using publicly available datasets, such as MIMIC-IV and eICU, where the model consistently outperformed traditional methodologies, including RNNs and standard Transformer frameworks. Moreover, the inclusion of the temporal attention mechanism enhances interpretability by identifying critical temporal windows associated with key clinical events. These results underscore the transformative potential of artificial intelligence to generate dynamic, context-aware insights, facilitating personalized treatment planning despite the inherent complexity and variability of clinical datasets.

AB  - Background The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in radiography presents transformative opportunities for diagnostic imaging and introduces complex ethical considerations. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to explore radiographers' perspectives on the ethical implications of AI in their field and identify key concerns and potential strategies for addressing them.Methods A structured questionnaire was distributed to a diverse group of radiographers in Saudi Arabia. The questionnaire included items on ethical concerns related to AI, the perceived impact on clinical practice, and suggestions for ethical AI integration in radiography. The data were analyzed using quantitative and qualitative methods to capture a broad range of perspectives.Results Three hundred eighty-eight radiographers responded and had varying levels of experience and specializations. Most (44.8%) participants were unfamiliar with the integration of AI into radiography. Approximately 32.9% of radiographers expressed uncertainty regarding the importance of transparency and explanatory capabilities in the AI systems used in radiology. Many (36.9%) participants indicated that they believed that AI systems used in radiology should be transparent and provide justifications for their decision-making procedures. A significant preponderance (44%) of respondents agreed that implementing AI in radiology may increase ethical dilemmas. However, 27.8%expressed uncertainty in recognizing and understanding the potential ethical issues that could arise from integrating AI in radiology. Of the respondents, 41.5% stated that the use of AI in radiology required establishing specific ethical guidelines. However, a significant percentage (28.9%) expressed the opposite opinion, arguing that utilizing AI in radiology does not require adherence to ethical standards. In contrast to the 46.6% of respondents voicing concerns about patient privacy over AI implementation, 41.5% of respondents did not have any such apprehensions.Conclusions This study revealed a complex ethical landscape in the integration of AI in radiography, characterized by enthusiasm and apprehension among professionals. It underscores the necessity for ethical frameworks, education, and policy development to guide the implementation of AI in radiography. These findings contribute to the ongoing discourse on AI in medical imaging and provide insights that can inform policymakers, educators, and practitioners in navigating the ethical challenges of AI adoption in healthcare.

AB  - Background The integration of large language models (LLMs) into healthcare offers transformative potential but raises significant ethical challenges. Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive framework to assess healthcare professionals' ethical awareness of LLMs usage.Objective To develop and validate a scale designed to evaluate healthcare professionals' ethical awareness regarding the integration of LLMs into clinical practice.Methods This two-phase methodological study was conducted in 2024 across nine healthcare institutions-five in Egypt and four in Saudi Arabia. In Phase I, a comprehensive literature review and semi-structured interviews with healthcare professionals guided the development of the initial scale and item pool. In Phase II, the psychometric properties of the scale were evaluated using data collected from 658 healthcare professionals. Construct validity was assessed through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, while internal consistency reliability was examined using Cronbach's alpha (alpha) coefficients and item-total correlation metrics.Results An initial pool of 36 items was refined to 21 items across 6 dimensions: data privacy and confidentiality, consent and autonomy, transparency and accountability, bias and equity, safety and professional integrity, and education and sustainability. EFA identified a six-factor structure accounting for 71.5% of the variance. CFA confirmed the scale's structure with strong model fit indices for first-order analysis (CMIN/DF = 1.798, CFI = 0.967, RMSEA = 0.050) and second-order analysis (CMIN/DF = 2.862, CFI = 0.927, RMSEA = 0.058). The scale demonstrated excellent internal consistency (overall Cronbach's alpha = 0.90; dimensions ranging from 0.780 to 0.964) and achieved satisfactory composite reliability, convergent validity and discriminant validity. Moderate statistically significant inter-factor correlations confirmed the multidimensional nature of the scale.Conclusion The developed scale is a valid and reliable tool for assessing healthcare professionals' ethical awareness in the use of LLMs in healthcare. It provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating and enhancing ethical considerations, promoting the responsible and informed use of LLMs technologies in clinical practice.

AB  - Different research studies about healthcare organizations in the public and private sectors display several opposite values. Therefore, there are several gaps that make consensual generalizations over the best manage-ment model as the only choice for the entire sector unlikely. Considering the importance and complexity of the Brazilian Unified Health System - SUS, the objective of this research study is to propose a framework to aid the choice between public and/or private management models for SUS using a benchmarking of multicriteria methods. Fuzzy TOPSIS, Fuzzy VIKOR, and a group method based on Game Theory were applied to a group of regional experts with different qualifications and perspectives concerning the management models to be selected as alternatives for the city of Ribeira similar to o Preto. Two decision matrices were constructed for that complex problem, one for Primary Care and another for Secondary Care, considering criteria from four dimensions. The alternatives were assessed through sensibility and robustness analysis. Ranking reversal, the perceptions of experts as decision-makers, and similarities to the reality of the city were also evaluated. It has been demonstrated that the framework shows potential in aiding group decision analysis, involving the public agents of each geographical territory covered by the healthcare management models, to endorse the use of proper methods that promote transparency and the use of scientific arguments.

AB  - Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and diabetes are the most prevalent NCDs, causing 1.9 and 1.5 million deaths yearly. Individuals diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (T1D) are at high risk of developing CVDs. Machine learning (ML) models have provided outstanding results in different domains, including healthcare, allowing to obtain models with high predictive performance. The aim of this study was to develop an interpretable data-driven approach to predict the 10-year CVD risk for T1D older individuals, aiming to provide both reasonable predictive performance and the identification of risk factors associated with CVDs. Data from T1D individuals at the Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen were used. Different ML-based models were considered, including KNN, decision tree, random forest, and multilayer perceptron (MLP). To enhance the predictive performance of ML models, the conditional tabular generative adversarial network (CTGAN) was used to create synthetic data and increase the size of the training data. Several filter and wrapper feature selection (FS) techniques were considered for identifying the most relevant features involved in CVD risk and enhancing the performance of the ML-based models used. To gain interpretability on predictive models, we used the post-hoc methods: SHAP and accumulated local effects. The experimental results showed a great performance of FS and ML-based models for predicting CVD risk. In particular, the MLP obtained the best results, with a mean absolute error of 0.0088 and mean relative absolute error of 0.0817. Regarding risk factors, age, Hba1c, and albuminuria were identified as crucial in CVD risk prediction, which is in line with recent clinical evidence. Our study contributes to identifying CVD risk and associated risk factors in a data-driven manner, helping to make early interventions and adequate treatments to prevent CVDs.

AB  - Ovarian cancer stands out as one of the most formidable adversaries in women's health, largely due to its typically subtle and nonspecific early symptoms, which pose significant challenges to early detection and diagnosis. Although existing diagnostic methods, such as biomarker testing and imaging, can help with early diagnosis to some extent, these methods still have limitations in sensitivity and accuracy, often leading to misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis. Ovarian cancer's high heterogeneity and complexity increase diagnostic challenges, especially in disease progression prediction and patient classification. Machine learning (ML) has outperformed traditional methods in cancer detection by processing large datasets to identify patterns missed by conventional techniques. However, existing AI models still struggle with accuracy in handling imbalanced and high-dimensional data, and their "black-box" nature limits clinical interpretability. To address these issues, this study proposes SHAP-GAN, an innovative diagnostic model for ovarian cancer that integrates Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The SHAP module quantifies each biomarker's contribution to the diagnosis, while the GAN component optimizes medical data generation. This approach tackles three key challenges in medical diagnosis: data scarcity, model interpretability, and diagnostic accuracy. Results show that SHAP-GAN outperforms traditional methods in sensitivity, accuracy, and interpretability, particularly with high-dimensional and imbalanced ovarian cancer datasets. The top three influential features identified are PRR11, CIAO1, and SMPD3, which exhibit wide SHAP value distributions, highlighting their significant impact on model predictions. The SHAP-GAN network has demonstrated an impressive accuracy rate of 99.34% on the ovarian cancer dataset, significantly outperforming baseline algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), and XGBoost. Specifically, SVM achieved an accuracy of 72.78%, LR achieved 86.09%, and XGBoost achieved 96.69%. These results highlight the superior performance of SHAP-GAN in handling high-dimensional and imbalanced datasets. Furthermore, SHAP-GAN significantly alleviates the challenges associated with intricate genetic data analysis, empowering medical professionals to tailor personalized treatment strategies for individual patients.

TI  - Women's views on using artificial intelligence in breast cancer screening: A review and qualitative study to guide breast screening services
T2  - BREAST
LA  - English
AB  - As breast screening services move towards use of healthcare AI (HCAI) for screen reading, research on public views of HCAI can inform more person-centered implementation. We synthesise reviews of public views of HCAI in general, and review primary studies of women's views of AI in breast screening. People generally appear open to HCAI and its potential benefits, despite a wide range of concerns; similarly, women are open towards AI in breast screening because of the potential benefits, but are concerned about a wide range of risks. Women want radiologists to remain central; oversight, evaluation and performance, care, equity and bias, transparency, and accountability are key issues; women may be less tolerant of AI error than of human error. Using our recent Australian primary study, we illustrate both the value of informing participants before collecting data, and women's views. The 40 screening-age women in this study stipulated four main conditions on breast screening AI implementation: 1) maintaining human control; 2) strong evidence of performance; 3) supporting familiarisation with AI; and 4) providing adequate reasons for introducing AI. Three solutions were offered to support familiarisation: transparency and information; slow and staged implementation; and allowing women to opt-out of AI reading. We provide recommendations to guide both implementation of AI in healthcare and research on public views of HCAI. Breast screening services should be transparent about AI use and share information about breast screening AI with women. Implementation should be slow and staged, providing opt-out options if possible. Screening services should demonstrate strong governance to maintain clinician control, demonstrate excellent AI system performance, assure data protection and bias mitigation, and give good reasons to justify implementation. When these measures are put in place, women are more likely to see HCAI use in breast screening as legitimate and acceptable.

AB  - The artificial skin-like stretchable ionic sensor device usually requires a synergistic effect of reliable adhesion between human machine interface, reasonable mechanical strength, and visually displayable transparency. A plant-inspired zwitterionic hydrogel was prepared through rapid UV initiation in the existence of cellulose nanocrystals as physically crosslinker and reinforcing agent. The resulting transparent zwitterionic nanocomposite hydrogel successfully brings the synergistic advantages of robust adhesive strength between diversified substrates such as skins, plastics, glass, and steels with remarkable mechanical properties of a superior stretchability over 1000% strain, a mechanical tensile strength up to 0.61 MPa, and compressive strength up to 7.5 MPa, manifesting in superior ionic transport performance, simultaneously. Furthermore, the zwitterionic nanocomposite hydrogel was fabricated as a wearable compliant stretchable pressure-strain sensor in the modality of the skin-adhesive patch to be sensitive to human motion such as finger touch and speech recognition for personal healthcare of patient sensory rebuilding and physiological data acquisition. It maintains compressive cycling sensibility at diverse pressure during 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 Hz, respectively. The multifunctional zwitterionic nanocomposite hydrogel could also be assembled into flexible electrical devices such as luminescent display and information transfer between human and robot communication for mechanosensory electronics and artificial intelligence.

AB  - Accurate prediction of in-hospital mortality is critical for healthcare risk management and clinical decision-making. However, existing time-series models struggle to model the non-stationarity and cross-periodic patterns in clinical data effectively, and their interpretability remains limited, particularly in addressing the dynamic importance of time-varying features and actionable counterfactual interventions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the xTimesNet-TSR-CoMTE framework, which integrates a hybrid spectral-temporal model, xTimesNet, with two interpretability methods: Two-Step temporal saliency Rescaling (TSR) and Counterfactual Multivariate Time series Explainability (CoMTE). xTimesNet leverages adaptive Wavelet-FFT mixture and Inception modules to capture cross-period temporal interactions in clinical time series. Experiments on the MIMIC-III dataset, involving 27 features over 48 timesteps, demonstrate the framework's superior performance, achieving a ROC_AUC of 0.785 and PR_AUC of 0.403. Comparative analysis shows that CoMTE outperforms existing methods by generating clinically plausible counterfactuals with minimal modifications, as evidenced by the lowest L1 distance of 0.024 and zero violent feature modifications. TSR identifies critical time-varying features and their temporal importance, pinpointing systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and body temperature as the most impactful predictors of mortality. CoMTE generates actionable counterfactual explanations by suggesting minimal interventions on these key features, such as maintaining systolic blood pressure within a stable range during critical early time points. This study advances the application of time-series models in clinical risk analysis and offers a robust solution for interpretable and actionable mortality prediction.

AB  - Introduction Acne detection is critical in dermatology, focusing on quality control of acne imagery, precise segmentation, and grading. Traditional research has been limited, typically concentrating on singular aspects of acne detection.Methods We propose a multi-task acne detection method, employing a CenterNet-based training paradigm to develop an advanced detection system. This system collects acne images via smartphones and features multi-task capabilities for detecting image quality and identifying various acne types. It differentiates between noninflammatory acne, papules, pustules, nodules, and provides detailed delineation for cysts and post-acne scars.Results The implementation of this multi-task learning-based framework in clinical diagnostics demonstrated an 83% accuracy in lesion categorization, surpassing ResNet18 models by 12%. Furthermore, it achieved a 76% precision in lesion stratification, outperforming dermatologists by 16%.Discussion Our framework represents a advancement in acne detection, offering a comprehensive tool for classification, localization, counting, and precise segmentation. It not only enhances the accuracy of remote acne lesion identification by doctors but also clarifies grading logic and criteria, facilitating easier grading judgments.

AB  - Background: Sepsis is a severe syndrome of organ dysfunction caused by infection; it has high heterogeneity and high in-hospital mortality, representing a grim clinical challenge for precision medicine in critical care. Objective: We aimed to extract reported sepsis biomarkers to provide users with comprehensive biomedical information and integrate retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and prompt engineering to enhance the accuracy, stability, and interpretability of clinical decisions recommended by large language models (LLMs). Methods: To address the challenge, we established and updated the first knowledge-enhanced platform, MetaSepsisKnowHub, comprising 427 sepsis biomarkers and 423 studies, aiming to systematically collect and annotate sepsis biomarkers to guide personalized clinical decision-making in the diagnosis and treatment of human sepsis. We curated a tailored LLM framework incorporating RAG and prompt engineering and incorporated 2 performance evaluation scales: the System Usability Scale and the Net Promoter Score. Results: The overall quantitative ratings of expert-reviewed clinical recommendations based on RAG surpassed baseline responses generated by 4 LLMs and showed a statistically significant improvement in textual questions (GPT-4: mean 75.79, SD 7.11 vs mean 81.59, SD 9.87; P=.02; GPT-4o: mean 70.36, SD 7.63 vs mean 77.98, SD 13.26; P=.02; Qwen2.5-instruct: mean 77.08 SD 3.75 vs mean 85.46, SD 7.27; P<.001; and DeepSeek-R1: mean 77.67, SD 3.66 vs mean 86.42, SD 8.56; P<.001), but no significant statistical differences could be measured in clinical scenarios. The RAG assessment score comparing RAG-based responses and expert-provided benchmark answers illustrated prominent factual correctness, accuracy, and knowledge recall compared to the baseline responses. After use, the average the System Usability Scale score was 82.20 (SD 14.17) and the Net Promoter Score was 72, demonstrating high user satisfaction and loyalty. Conclusions: We highlight the pioneering MetaSepsisKnowHub platform, and we show that combining MetaSepsisKnowHub with RAG can minimize limitations on precision and maximize the breadth of LLMs to shorten the bench-to-bedside distance, serving as a knowledge-enhanced paradigm for future application of artificial intelligence in critical care medicine.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects approximately 1% of the population, presenting a significant healthcare challenge due to limited resources, particularly a shortage of clinicians, which impedes timely ASD detection and management in children. This study investigates stakeholder viewpoints regarding the effectiveness of integrating machine learning (ML) into the information and communications technology (ICT) platform for ASD detection and intervention. Primary stakeholders, including parents and clinicians, provide first hand experiences with this technology during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The research identifies critical technology adoption factors by synthesizing stakeholder input based on user experiences, technology design, technology utility, and its impact. Additionally, the study gathers insights from potential investors interested in assistive technologies. Stakeholders unanimously acknowledge the pivotal role of technology in enhancing current ASD detection and management. However, their attitudes toward technology adoption exhibit divergent trends during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The study highlights a shift toward a technology-enabled, human-centred framework, which gained prominence post-pandemic. Various factors contributing to this shift in stakeholder perspective were identified, including caregiver stress, technostress, and pandemic-induced environmental factors affecting stakeholders' stress levels and motivating them to shift towards a human-centric model. Stakeholders emphasize the paramount importance of human-centred approaches in ASD detection and intervention, with technology serving as an empowering tool. Stakeholders also highlight the imperative ethical and legal considerations to foster trust and enhance the adoption of ML-based technology. Consequently, future research should delve into stakeholder perspectives within the framework of fairness, accountability, transparency, and ethics (FATE) to ensure these technologies' responsible development and implementation.

AB  - Background: Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is associated with elevated rates of readmission and mortality. Accurate prediction of readmission risk is essential for optimizing healthcare resources and enhancing patient outcomes. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study utilizing HFpEF patient data from two institutions: the First Affiliated Hospital Zhejiang University School of Medicine for model development and internal validation, and the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University for external validation. A machine learning (ML) model was developed and validated using 53 variables to predict the risk of readmission within one year. The model's performance was assessed using several metrics, including the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, model training time, model prediction time and brier score. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis was employed to enhance model interpretability, and a dynamic nomogram was constructed to visualize the predictive model. Results: Among the 766 HFpEF patients included in the study, 203 (26.5%) were readmitted within one year. The LightGBM model exhibited the highest predictive performance, with an AUC of 0.88 (95% confidence interval (CI):0.84-0.91), an accuracy of 0.79, a sensitivity of 0.81, and a specificity of 0.78. Key predictors included the E/e' ratio, NYHA classification, LVEF, age, BNP levels, MLR, history of atrial fibrillation (AF), use of ACEI/ARB/ ARNI, and history of myocardial infarction (MI). External validation also demonstrated strong predictive performance, with an AUC of 0.87 (95%CI:0.83-0.91). Conclusions: The LightGBM model exhibited robust performance in predicting one-year readmission risk among HFpEF patients, providing a valuable tool for clinicians to identify high-risk individuals and implement timely interventions.

TI  - False-positive tolerant model misconduct mitigation in distributed federated learning on electronic health record data across clinical institutions
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA  - English
KW  - LOGISTIC-REGRESSION
KW  - BLOCKCHAIN
AB  - As collaborative Machine Learning on cross-institutional, fully distributed networks become an important tool in predictive health modeling, its inherent security risks must be addressed. One among such risks is the lack of a mitigation strategy against injections of tampered models (or "model misconduct") into the collaborative pipeline, without excessive false alarms. We propose a false-positive tolerant methodology to preserve model integrity and mitigate the impacts of adversarial misconduct in a Federated Learning scenario. Our method grants false-positive detection leeway as each participating site would be quarantined only when their misbehavior allowance (or "budget") is exhausted, preventing over-ostracization and the subsequent loss of sample size. We evaluated our system on a decentralized blockchain network with three datasets. Our method demonstrated gains of 0.058-0.121 Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve when compared to the solution without false-positive tolerance, with negligible overhead (< 12 milliseconds). Our method can serve as an efficient and robust approach to safeguard the distributed Federated Learning process in collaborative healthcare, inheriting blockchain's characteristics of transparency and decentralization. Future work can apply our methodology to more sophisticated machine learning algorithms or scale the experiments in a large-scale learning scenario with more participating sites and larger sample sizes.

KW  - Deep learning
AB  - With advances in reinforcement learning (RL), agents are now being developed in high stakes application domains such as healthcare and transportation. Explaining the behavior of these agents is challenging, as the environments in which they act have large state spaces, and their decision-making can be affected by delayed rewards, making it difficult to analyze their behavior. To address this problem, several approaches have been developed. Some approaches attempt to convey the global behavior of the agent, describing the actions it takes in different states. Other approaches devised local explanations which provide information regarding the agent's decision-making in a particular state. In this paper, we combine global and local explanation methods, and evaluate their joint and separate contributions, providing (to the best of our knowledge) the first user study of combined local and global explanations for RL agents. Specifically, we augment strategy summaries that extract important trajectories of states from simulations of the agent with saliency maps which show what information the agent attends to. Our results show that the choice of what states to include in the summary (global information) strongly affects people's understanding of agents: participants shown summaries that included important states significantly outperformed participants who were presented with agent behavior in a set of world-states that are likely to appear during gameplay. We find mixed results with respect to augmenting demonstrations with saliency maps (local information), as the addition of saliency maps, in the form of raw heat maps, did not significantly improve performance in most cases. However, we do find some evidence that saliency maps can help users better understand what information the agent relies on during its decision-making, suggesting avenues for future work that can further improve explanations of RL agents.

AB  - Low back pain (LBP) is a global health-problem phenomenon. Most patients are categorized as non-specific, thus requiring an individualized approach which still poses a major challenge. In this paper, sEMG recordings from two pairs of lumbar muscle sites were collected during an isometric trunk extension exercise. Ninety-one subjects were included in the study; 29 patients with non-specific chronic LBP (CLBP), 25 patients with radiculopathy (RLBP), and 37 control healthy subjects (HS). Six best-performing time-domain raw features were employed to model contextual secondary feature groups. Neuromuscular LBP characteristics were described with coordination, co-activation, trends, and fatigue measures. Altogether, a set of 327 secondary features was created where inputs into the classification models were further refined by employing neighborhood component analysis (NCA). NCA effectively reduced the number of features (<20 components), alongside preserving them in the original interpretable domain. A set of 23 different classifiers was employed and explored, resulting in classification accuracy of 0.94 for HS vs. LBP, 0.89 for HS vs. CLBP, 0.98 for HS vs. RLBP, and 0.89 for CLBP vs. RLBP differentiation. High median precision (0.97) and sensitivity (0.99) across all classifiers for HS vs. RLBP differentiation was obtained, with only three feature components utilized (out of 327). Support vector machines (SVM) and k-nearest neighbor kNN) based classifiers consistently demonstrated best classification results. Different profiles of CLBP patients were presented and discussed. The suggested method demonstrated the potential for patients' subgrouping and subsequent more individualized rehabilitation treatments, backed by medical interpretations through feature modeling.

KW  - Quality of Health Care
AB  - The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into pharmaceutical practices raises critical ethical concerns, including algorithmic bias, data commodification and global health inequities. While existing AI ethics frameworks emphasise transparency and fairness, they often overlook structural vulnerabilities tied to race, gender and socioeconomic status. This paper introduces relational accountability-a feminist ethics framework-to critique AI-driven pharmaceutical practices, arguing that corporate reliance on biased algorithms exacerbates inequalities by design. Through case studies of Pfizer-IBM Watson's immuno-oncology collaboration and Google DeepMind's National Health Service partnership, we demonstrate how AI entrenches disparities in drug pricing, access and development. We propose a causal pathway linking biased training data to inequitable health outcomes, supported by empirical evidence of AI-driven price discrimination and exclusionary clinical trial recruitment algorithms. Policy solutions, including algorithmic audits and equity-centred data governance, are advanced to realign AI with the ethical imperative. This work bridges feminist bioethics and AI governance, offering a novel lens to address structural harm in healthcare innovation.

AB  - BackgroundAlthough machine learning (ML) models are well-liked for their outperformance in prediction, greatly avoided due to the lack of intuition and explanation of their predictions. Interpretable ML is, therefore, an emerging research field that combines the performance and interpretability of ML models to create comprehensive solutions for complex decision-making analysis. Conversely, infant mortality is a global public health concern affecting health, social well-being, socio-economic development, and healthcare services. The study employs advanced interpretable ML techniques to anticipate and understand the factors affecting infant mortality in Bangladesh, overcoming the shortcomings of the conventional logistic regression (LR) model.MethodsBy utilizing the global surrogate model and local individual conditional expectation (ICE) interpretability technique, the interpretable support vector machine (SVM) has been used in this study to reveal significant characteristics of infant mortality using data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) 2017-18. To investigate intricate decision-making analysis of infant mortality, we adapted SVM and LR techniques with the hyperparameter tuning parameters. These models' performances were initially assessed using the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve, run-time, and confusion matrix parameters with 100 permutations. Afterward, the SVM model's model-agnostic explanation and the LR model's interpretation were compared to enhance advanced comprehension for further insights.ResultsThe results of the 100 permutations demonstrated that the LR model (Average: accuracy = 0.9105, precision = NaN, sensitivity = 0, specificity = 1, F1-score = 0, area under the ROC curve (AUC) = 0.6780, run-time = 0.0832) outperformed the SVM model (Average: accuracy = 0.8470, precision = 0.1062, sensitivity = 0.0949, specificity = 0.9209, F1-score = 0.1000, AUC = 0.5632, run-time = 0.0254) in predicting infant mortality, but the LR model had a slower run-time and it was unable to predict any positive cases. The interpretation of LR analysis revealed that infant mortality rates decrease when mothers give birth after over two years, with higher educational attainment, overweight or obese mothers, working mothers, and families with polluted cooking fuel having lower rates. The local ICE interpretability technique, which depicts individual influences on the average likelihood of dying within the first birthday, explores the interpretable SVM model that mothers with normal BMIs, giving birth within two years, using less polluted cooking fuel, working mothers, and having male infant were more likely to experience infant death. The interpretable SVM model based on the global surrogate model also reveals that working mothers who used polluted cooking fuel at home and working women who used less polluted cooking fuel but had a longer period between pregnancies than two years would have higher infant death rates. Even among non-working mothers who used polluted cooking fuel and gave birth within two years of the preceding one, infant death rates were higher.ConclusionsThe interpretable SVM model reveals global interpretations help clinicians understand the entire conditional distribution, while local interpretations focus on specific instances, providing different insights into model behavior. Interpretable ML models aid policymakers, stakeholders, and families in understanding and preventing infant deaths by improving policy-making strategies and establishing effective family counseling services.

AB  - In Australian intensive care units (ICUs), Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises to enhance efficiency and improve patient outcomes. However, ethical concerns surrounding AI must be addressed before widespread adoption. We examine the ethical challenges of of AI using the framework of the four pillars of biomedical ethicsdbeneficence, nonmaleficence, autonomy, and justice, and discuss the need for a fifth pillar of explicability. We consider the risks of perpetuating inequities, privacy breaches, and unintended harms, particularly in disadvantaged populations such as First Nations people. We advocate fora national strategy for ICUs to guide the ethical implementation of AI, that aligns with existing National AI Frameworks. Our recommendations for implementation of safe and ethical AI in ICU include education, developing guidelines, and ensuring transparency in AI decision-making. A coordinated strategy is essential to balance AI's benefits with the ethical responsibility to protect patients and healthcare providers in critical care settings. (c) 2025 The Authors.

AB  - ObjectiveFor children with asthma, emergency department (ED) visits are common, expensive, and often avoidable. Though several factors are associated with ED use (demographics, comorbidities, insurance, medications), its predictability using electronic health record (EHR) data is understudied.
   MethodsWe used a retrospective cohort study design and EHR data from one center to examine the relationship of patient factors in 1 year (2013) and the likelihood of frequent ED use (2 visits) in the following year (2014), using bivariate and multivariable statistics. We applied and compared several machine-learning algorithms to predict frequent ED use, then selected a model based on accuracy, parsimony, and interpretability.
   ResultsWe identified 2691 children. In bivariate analyses, future frequent ED use was associated with demographics, co-morbidities, insurance status, medication history, and use of healthcare resources. Machine learning algorithms had very good AUC (area under the curve) values [0.66-0.87], though fair PPV (positive predictive value) [48-70%] and poor sensitivity [16-27%]. Our final multivariable logistic regression model contained two variables: insurance status and prior ED use. For publicly insured patients, the odds of frequent ED use were 3.1 [2.2-4.5] times that of privately insured patients. Publicly insured patients with 4+ ED visits and privately insured patients with 6+ ED visits in a year had 50% probability of frequent ED use the following year. The model had an AUC of 0.86, PPV of 56%, and sensitivity of 23%.
   ConclusionAmong children with asthma, prior frequent ED use and insurance status strongly predict future ED use.

AB  - Many machine learning-based methods have been widely applied to Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) and are achieving high accuracy. However, they are black-box methods that are unable to explain the reasons behind the diagnosis. The trade-off between accuracy and interpretability of diagnosis models is important, especially for human disease. This work aims to propose an approach for generating rule-based models for CAD diagnosis. The classification rule generation is modeled as combinatorial optimization problem and it can be solved by means of metaheuristic algorithms. Swarm intelligence algorithms like Equilibrium Optimizer Algorithm (EOA) have demonstrated great performance in solving different optimization problems. Our present study comes up with a Novel Discrete Equilibrium Optimizer Algorithm (NDEOA) for the classification rule generation from training CAD dataset. The proposed NDEOA is a discrete version of EOA, which use a discrete encoding of a particle for representing a classification rule; new discrete operators are also defined for the particle's position update equation to adapt real operators to discrete space. To evaluate the proposed approach, the real world Z-Alizadeh Sani dataset has been employed. The proposed approach generate a diagnosis model composed of 17 rules, among them, five rules for the class "Normal" and 12 rules for the class "CAD". In comparison to nine black-box and eight white-box state-of-the-art approaches, the results show that the generated diagnosis model by the proposed approach is more accurate and more interpretable than all white-box models and are competitive to the black-box models. It achieved an overall accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 93.54%, 80% and 100% respectively; which show that, the proposed approach can be successfully utilized to generate efficient rule-based CAD diagnosis models.

AB  - Chronic alcohol consumption poses significant public health challenges globally. In underserved regions, the lack of AI-based interventions for alcohol addiction highlights a critical gap in the healthcare system, particularly regarding the early detection of alcohol abuse. Henceforth, this research aims to raise awareness of alcohol use disorder and proposes a novel AI-powered solution designed with an improved classification algorithm to address this deficiency, with a primary focus on a cutting-edge prediction model. This research shifts the current reactive approach in alcohol addiction intervention to proactive approach by employing an enhanced meta-classification algorithm (EMC) that focuses on improving the interpretability, efficiency, and accuracy of predictions. The proposed EMC ultimately provides a robust tool for healthcare professionals and patients which fosters more effective and personalized intervention strategies for alcohol addiction recovery. The results demonstrate a remarkable 10.13% improvement in balanced accuracy and a 9.72% enhancement in the area under the curve compared to traditional ensemble and state-of-the-art methods. Thus, findings from this study will assist medical practitioners and policymakers in developing evidence-based strategies to combat alcoholism and enhance public health outcomes. By deriving insights from real-world case study, the outcome of this research represents a pioneering effort to betterment of healthcare in underserved regions, offering a low-cost, scalable solution for early detection, and has the potential to significantly improve outcomes in marginalized communities.

AB  - Extracting clinical concepts, such as problems, diagnosis, and treatment, from unstructured clinical narrative documents enables data-driven approaches such as machine and deep learning to support advanced applications such as clinical decision-support systems, the assessment of disease progression, and the intelligent analysis of treatment efficacy. Various tools such as cTAKES, Sophia, MetaMap, and other rules-based approaches and algorithms have been used for automatic concept extraction. Recently, machine- and deep-learning approaches have been used to extract, classify, and accurately annotate terms and phrases. However, the requirement of an annotated dataset, which is labor-intensive, impedes the success of data-driven approaches. A rule-based mechanism could support the process of annotation, but existing rule-based approaches fail to adequately capture contextual, syntactic, and semantic patterns. This study intends to introduce a comprehensive rule-based system that automatically extracts clinical concepts from unstructured narratives with higher accuracy and transparency. The proposed system is a pipelined approach, capable of recognizing clinical concepts of three types, problem, treatment, and test, in the dataset collected from a published repository as a part of the I2b2 challenge 2010. The system's performance is compared with that of three existing systems: Quick UMLS, BIO-CRF, and the Rules (i2b2) model. Compared to the baseline systems, the average F1-score of 72.94% was found to be 13% better than Quick UMLS, 3% better than BIO CRF, and 30.1% better than the Rules (i2b2) model. Individually, the system performance was noticeably higher for problem-related concepts, with an F1-score of 80.45%, followed by treatment-related concepts and test-related concepts, with F1-scores of 76.06% and 55.3%, respectively. The proposed methodology significantly improves the performance of concept extraction from unstructured clinical narratives by exploiting the linguistic and lexical semantic features. The approach can ease the automatic annotation process of clinical data, which ultimately improves the performance of supervised data-driven applications trained with these data.

AB  - BackgroundHeart failure (HF) is a debilitating condition affecting over 6.7 million adults in the United States. Social risks and complexity, or personal, social, and clinical aspects of persons' experiences, have been found to influence healthcare utilization and hospitalizations in persons with HF. Low-value utilization, or irregular outpatient visits with frequent emergency room use, or hospitalization is common among persons with complex conditions and social risk and requires further investigation in the HF population.ObjectivesThe purpose of this research was to assess the influence of complexity and social risk on low-value utilization in persons with HF using machine learning approaches.MethodsSupervised machine learning, tree-based predictive modeling was conducted on an existing data set of adults with HF in the eight-county region of Western New York for the year 2022. Decision tree and random forest models were validated using a 70/30 training/testing data set and k-fold cross-validation. The models were compared for accuracy and interpretability using the area under the curve, Matthews correlation coefficient, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and negative predictive value.ResultsArea deprivation index, a proxy for social risk, number of chronic conditions, age, and substance use disorders were predictors of low-value utilization in both the decision tree and random forest models. The decision tree model performed moderately, whereas the random forest model performed excellently and added hardship as an additional important variable.DiscussionThis is the first known study to look at the outcome of low-value utilization, targeting individuals who are underutilizing outpatient services. The random forest model performed better than the decision tree; however, features were similar in both models, with area deprivation index as the key variable in predicting low-value utilization. The decision tree was able to produce specific cutoff points, making it more interpretable and useful for clinical application. Both models can be used to create clinical tools for identifying and targeting individuals for intervention and follow-up.

AB  - BackgroundArtificial Intelligence (AI) promises to revolutionize healthcare but has been previously characterized by cycles of "boom" and "bust." Alongside technological capability, realistic user expectations are essential for appropriate implementation. We surveyed surgeons, surgical trainees, and medical students in Ireland regarding their current perceptions.MethodsElectronic survey distributed through professional networks and social media with institutional ethical approval. Statistical and thematic analyses were performed to identify key perspectives.ResultsAmong 94 participants (63% medical students, 18% surgical trainees, 15% consultants, and 4% ancillary surgical roles), 62.7% "strongly agreed" that AI could enhance real-time decision-making during surgery. Most (90.5%) believed AI was already being surgically deployed to some extent although only 18% felt it appropriate ever to use for decision-making. While 53.2% were positive about AI's potential to improve surgical outcomes, 72.3% reported no AI training in this context despite 86.2% expressing interest. The primary concerns with AI regarded accuracy and reliability (38.7%) and the lack of evidence of effectiveness (33.7%). Surgical trainees expressed greater concern about AI transparency (47% "extremely concerned") compared to consultants (42.9% "slightly concerned") and, along with students, declared higher concern regarding liability issues versus consultants (64.3% of whom had "little to no concern").ConclusionStudents and postgraduates in surgery in Ireland express optimism and high expectations for AI's potential to improve surgery. However, concerns about reliability, evidence, and liability persist with clear caution regarding automated decision-making and insight regarding the need for education that may help align expectations realistically regarding AI evolution.

AB  - Background: Collaborative privacy-preserving modeling across several healthcare institutions allows for the construction of more generalizable predictive models while protecting patient privacy. Objective: We aim at addressing the site availability issue on a hierarchical network by designing an immutable/ transparent/source-verifiable quorum mechanism.Methods: We developed an approach to combine a hierarchical learning algorithm, a novel Proof-of-Quorum (PoQ) consensus protocol, and a design of blockchain smart contracts. We constructed QuorumChain as an example and evaluated the scenarios of site-unavailability during the initialization and/or iteration phases of the modeling process on three healthcare/genomic datasets.Results: When one or more sites would become unavailable, HierarchicalChain could not function, whereas QuorumChain improved predictive correctness significantly (the full Area Under the receiver operating char-acteristic Curve, or AUC, improved from 0.068 to 0.441, all with p-values < 0.001).Conclusion: By constructing a quorum to continue the modeling process, QuorumChain possesses the capability to tackle the situation of sites being unavailable. It inherits the capability of learning on network-of-networks, improves learning continuity, and provides data/software immutability, transparency, and provenance, which can be important in expediting clinical research.

AB  - Background Complete and unbiased reporting of clinical trial results is essential for evaluating medical advances, yet publication bias and reporting discrepancies in research on the clinical application of artificial intelligence (AI) remain unknown. Methods We conducted a comprehensive search of research publications and clinical trial registries focused on the application of AI in healthcare. Our search included publications in Dimensions.ai and pre-registered records from ClinicalTrials.gov and the EU Clinical Trials Registry before 31 December 2023. We linked registered trials to their corresponding publications, analysed the registration, reporting and different dissemination patterns of results, identified discrepancies between clinical trial registries and published literature, and assessed the use of these results in secondary research. Findings We identified 28,248 publications related to the use of AI in clinical settings and found 1863 publications that included a clinical trial registration ID. The clinical trial registry search identified 3710 trials evaluating the use of AI in clinical settings, of which 1106 trials are completed, yet only 101 trials have published results. By linking the trials to their corresponding publications, we found that 26 trials had results available from both registries and publications. There were more results in trial registries than in articles, but researchers showed a clear preference for rapid dissemination of results through peer-reviewed articles (37.6% published within one year) over trial registries (15.8%). Discrepancies and omissions of results were common, and no complete agreement was observed between the two sources. Selective reporting of publications occurred in 53.6% of cases, and the underestimation of the incidence of adverse events is alarming. Interpretation This research uncovers concerns with the registration and reporting of AI clinical trial results. While trial registries and publications serve distinct yet complementary roles in disseminating research fi ndings, discrepancies between them may undermine the reliability of the evidence. We emphasise adherence to guidelines that promote transparency and standardisation of reporting, especially for investigator-initiated trials (IITs). Copyright (c) 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Introduction Emerging developments in applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare offer the opportunity to improve diagnostic capabilities in obstetrics and gynaecology (O&G), ensuring early detection of pathology, optimal management and improving survival. Consensus on a robust AI healthcare framework is crucial for standardising protocols that promote data privacy and transparency, minimise bias, and ensure patient safety. Here, we describe the study protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate current applications of AI in O&G diagnostics with consideration of reporting standards used and their ethical implications. This protocol is written following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) 2015 checklist.Methods and analysis The study objective is to explore the current application of AI in O&G diagnostics and assess the reporting standards used in these studies. Electronic bibliographic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane will be searched. Study selection, data extraction and subsequent narrative synthesis and meta-analyses will be carried out following the PRISMA-P guidelines. Included papers will be English-language full-text articles from May 2015 to March 2024, which provide original data, as AI has been redefined in recent literature. Papers must use AI as the predictive method, focusing on improving O&G diagnostic outcomes. We will evaluate the reporting standards including the risk of bias, lack of transparency and consider the ethical implications and potential harm to patients. Outcome measures will involve assessing the included studies against gold-standard criteria for robustness of model development (Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis, model predictive performance, model risk of bias and applicability (Prediction model Risk Of Bias Assessment Tool and study reporting (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials-AI) guidance.Methods and analysis The study objective is to explore the current application of AI in O&G diagnostics and assess the reporting standards used in these studies.

AB  - Objective: Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based approaches for extracting Social Drivers of Health (SDoH) from clinical notes offer healthcare systems an efficient way to identify patients' social needs, yet we know little about the acceptability of this approach to patients and clinicians. We investigated patient and clinician acceptability through interviews.
   Materials and Methods: We interviewed primary care patients experiencing social needs (n = 19) and clinicians (n = 14) about their acceptability of "SDoH autosuggest," an AI-based approach for extracting SDoH from clinical notes. We presented storyboards depicting the approach and asked participants to rate their acceptability and discuss their rationale.
   Results: Participants rated SDoH autosuggest moderately acceptable (mean = 3.9/5 patients; mean = 3.6/5 clinicians). Patients' ratings varied across domains, with substance use rated most and employment rated least acceptable. Both groups raised concern about information integrity, actionability, impact on clinical interactions and relationships, and privacy. In addition, patients raised concern about transparency, autonomy, and potential harm, whereas clinicians raised concern about usability.
   Discussion: Despite reporting moderate acceptability of the envisioned approach, patients and clinicians expressed multiple concerns about AI systems that extract SDoH. Participants emphasized the need for high-quality data, non-intrusive presentation methods, and clear communication strategies regarding sensitive social needs. Findings underscore the importance of engaging patients and clinicians to mitigate unintended consequences when integrating AI approaches into care.
   Conclusion: Although AI approaches like SDoH autosuggest hold promise for efficiently identifying SDoH from clinical notes, they must also account for concerns of patients and clinicians to ensure these systems are acceptable and do not undermine trust.

AB  - BackgroundIncreasing life expectancy results in more elderly people struggling with age related diseases and functional conditions. This poses huge challenges towards establishing new approaches for maintaining health at a higher age. An important aspect for age related deterioration of the general patient condition is frailty. The frailty syndrome is associated with a high risk for falls, hospitalization, disability, and finally increased mortality. Using predictive data mining enables the discovery of potential risk factors and can be used as clinical decision support system, which provides the medical doctor with information on the probable clinical patient outcome. This enables the professional to react promptly and to avert likely adverse events in advance.MethodsMedical data of 474 study participants containing 284 health related parameters, including questionnaire answers, blood parameters and vital parameters from the Toledo Study for Healthy Aging (TSHA) was used. Binary classification models were built in order to distinguish between frail and non-frail study subjects.ResultsUsing the available TSHA data and the discovered potential predictors, it was possible to design, develop and evaluate a variety of different predictive models for the frailty syndrome. The best performing model was the support vector machine (SVM, 78.31%). Moreover, a methodology was developed, making it possible to explore and to use incomplete medical data and further identify potential predictors and enable interpretability.ConclusionsThis work demonstrates that it is feasible to use incomplete, imbalanced medical data for the development of a predictive model for the frailty syndrome. Moreover, potential predictive factors have been discovered, which were clinically approved by the clinicians. Future work will improve prediction accuracy, especially with regard to separating the group of frail patients into frail and pre-frail ones and analyze the differences among them.

AB  - Breast cancer (BrCa), being one of the most prevalent forms of cancer in women, poses many challenges in the field of treatment and diagnosis due to its complex biological mechanisms. Early and accurate diagnosis plays a fundamental role in improving survival rates, but the limitations of existing imaging methods and clinical data interpretation often prevent optimal results. Large Language Models (LLMs), which are developed based on advanced architectures such as transformers, have brought about a significant revolution in data processing and medical decision-making. By analyzing a large volume of medical and clinical data, these models enable early diagnosis by identifying patterns in images and medical records and provide personalized treatment strategies by integrating genetic markers and clinical guidelines. Despite the transformative potential of these models, their use in BrCa management faces challenges such as data sensitivity, algorithm transparency, ethical considerations, and model compatibility with the details of medical applications that need to be addressed to achieve reliable results. This review systematically reviews the impact of LLMs on BrCa treatment and diagnosis. This study's objectives include analyzing the role of LLM technology in diagnosing and treating this disease. The findings indicate that the application of LLMs has resulted in significant improvements in various aspects of BrCa management, such as a 35% increase in the Efficiency of Diagnosis and BrCa Treatment (EDBC), a 30% enhancement in the System's Clinical Trust and Reliability (SCTR), and a 20% improvement in the quality of patient education and information (IPEI). Ultimately, this study demonstrates the importance of LLMs in advancing precision medicine for BrCa and paves the way for effective patient-centered care solutions.

AB  - Background and objective: Immunotherapy holds promise in enhancing pathological complete response rates in breast cancer, albeit confined to a select cohort of patients. Consequently, pinpointing factors predictive of treatment responsiveness is of paramount importance. Gene expression and regulation, inherently operating within intricate networks, constitute fundamental molecular machinery for cellular processes and often serve as robust biomarkers. Nevertheless, contemporary feature selection approaches grapple with two key challenges: opacity in modeling and scarcity in accounting for gene-gene interactions Methods: To address these limitations, we devise a novel feature selection methodology grounded in cooperative game theory, harmoniously integrating with sophisticated machine learning models. This approach identifies interconnected gene regulatory network biomarker modules with priori genetic linkage architecture. Specifically, we leverage Shapley values on network to quantify feature importance, while strategically constraining their integration based on network expansion principles and nodal adjacency, thereby fostering enhanced interpretability in feature selection. We apply our methods to a publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing dataset of breast cancer immunotherapy responses, using the identified feature gene set as biomarkers. Functional enrichment analysis with independent validations further illustrates their effective predictive performance Results: We demonstrate the sophistication and excellence of the proposed method in data with network structure. It unveiled a cohesive biomarker module encompassing 27 genes for immunotherapy response. Notably, this module proves adept at precisely predicting anti-PD1 therapeutic outcomes in breast cancer patients with classification accuracy of 0.905 and AUC value of 0.971, underscoring its unique capacity to illuminate gene functionalities Conclusion: The proposed method is effective for identifying network module biomarkers, and the detected antiPD1 response biomarkers can enrich our understanding of the underlying physiological mechanisms of immunotherapy, which have a promising application for realizing precision medicine.

AB  - Introduction: Nurses' innovative behaviours play a crucial role in addressing the challenges including adapting to emerging technologies, resource limitations and social realities such as population ageing that are intricately tied to today's healthcare landscape. Innovative behaviours improve healthcare quality, patient safety and satisfaction. Organisational factors and individual attributes influence nurses' inclination to innovate. With the rise of artificial intelligence and novel technology, healthcare institutions are actively engaged in the pursuit of identifying nurses who demonstrate innovative qualities. Developing a comprehensive protocol to elucidate the various dimensions of nurses' innovative behaviours and constructing a valid measuring instrument, rooted in this protocol represents a significant step in operationalising this concept. Methods and analysis: The study encompasses two phases: a qualitative study combined with a literature review, followed by the design and psychometric evaluation of the instrument. To ensure diversity, a maximum variation purposive sampling method will be used during the qualitative phase to select clinical nurses. In-depth semistructured interviews will be conducted and analysed using conventional content analysis. Additionally, a comprehensive literature review will supplement any missing features not captured in the qualitative phase, ensuring their inclusion in the primary tool. The subsequent quantitative phase will focus on evaluating the questionnaire's psychometric properties, including face, content and construct validity through exploratory factor analyses (including at least 300 samples) and confirmatory factor analyses (including at least 200 samples). Internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha), reliability (test-retest), responsiveness, interpretability and scoring will also be assessed. Ethics and dissemination: This study originates from a doctoral dissertation in nursing. Permission and ethical approval from Semnan University of Medical Sciences has been obtained with reference code IR.SEMUMS.1401.226. The study's findings will ultimately be submitted as a research paper to a peer-reviewed journal.

AB  - Objective To develop a framework for good clinical decision-making using machine learning (ML) models for interventional, patient-level decisions.Design Grounded theory qualitative interview study.Setting Primarily single-site at a major urban academic paediatric hospital, with external sampling.Participants Sixteen participants representing physicians (n=10), nursing (n=3), respiratory therapists (n=2) and an ML specialist (n=1) with experience working in acute care environments were identified through purposive sampling. Individuals were recruited to represent a spectrum of ML knowledge (three expert, four knowledgeable and nine non-expert) and years of experience (median=12.9 years postgraduation). Recruitment proceeded through snowball sampling, with individuals approached to represent a diversity of fields, levels of experience and attitudes towards artificial intelligence (AI)/ML. A member check step and consultation with patients was undertaken to vet the framework, which resulted in some minor revisions to the wording and framing.Interventions A semi-structured virtual interview simulating an intensive care unit handover for a hypothetical patient case using a simulated ML model and seven visualisations using known methods addressing interpretability of models in healthcare. Participants were asked to make an initial care plan for the patient, then were presented with a model prediction followed by the seven visualisations to explore their judgement and potential influence and understanding of the visualisations. Two visualisations contained contradicting information to probe participants' resolution process for the contrasting information. The ethical justifiability and clinical reasoning process were explored.Main outcome A comprehensive framework was developed that is grounded in established medicolegal and ethical standards and accounts for the incorporation of inference from ML models.Results We found that for making good decisions, participants reflected across six main categories: evidence, facts and medical knowledge relevant to the patient's condition; how that knowledge may be applied to this particular patient; patient-level, family-specific and local factors; facts about the model, its development and testing; the patient-level knowledge sufficiently represented by the model; the model's incorporation of relevant contextual factors. This judgement was centred on and anchored most heavily on the overall balance of benefits and risks to the patient, framed by the goals of care. We found evidence of automation bias, with many participants assuming that if the model's explanation conflicted with their prior knowledge that their judgement was incorrect; others concluded the exact opposite, drawing from their medical knowledge base to reject the incorrect information provided in the explanation. Regarding knowledge about the model, we found that participants most consistently wanted to know about the model's historical performance in the cohort of patients in their local unit where the hypothetical patient was situated.Conclusion Good decisions using AI tools require reflection across multiple domains. We provide an actionable framework and question guide to support clinical decision-making with AI.

AB  - Introduction: The prevalence of cognitive impairment and dementia in the older population is increasing, and thereby, early detection of cognitive decline is essential for effective intervention. Methods: This study included 2,288 participants with normal cognitive function from the Ma'anshan Healthy Aging Cohort Study. Forty-two potential predictors, including demographic characteristics, chronic diseases, lifestyle factors, anthropometric indices, physical function, and baseline cognitive function, were selected based on clinical importance and previous research. The dataset was partitioned into training, validation, and test sets in a proportion of 60% for training, 20% for validation, and 20% for testing, respectively. Recursive feature elimination was used for feature selection, followed by six machine learning algorithms that were employed for model development. The performance of the models was evaluated using area under the curve (AUC), specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy. Moreover, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was conducted to access the interpretability of the final selected model and to gain insights into the impact of features on the prediction outcomes. SHAP force plots were established to vividly show the application of the prediction model at the individual level. Results: The final predictive model based on the Naive Bayes algorithm achieved an AUC of 0.820 (95% CI, 0.773-0.887) on the test set, outperforming other algorithms. The top ten influential features in the model included baseline Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), education, self-reported economic status, collective or social activities, Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), body mass index, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, instrumental activities of daily living, and age. The model demonstrated the potential to identify individuals at a higher risk of cognitive impairment within 3 years from older adults. Conclusion: The predictive model developed in this study contributes to the early detection of cognitive impairment in older adults by primary healthcare staff in community settings.

AB  - Featured Application The proposed intelligent filtering system can be seamlessly integrated into platforms utilizing large language models (LLMs), including customer service chatbots, educational tutors, healthcare assistants, and code-generation tools. By dynamically identifying and mitigating harmful, biased, or unethical outputs in real time, the system significantly enhances the safety and reliability of LLM-powered applications. This approach supports the responsible deployment of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies by ensuring adherence to ethical standards and regulatory frameworks while simultaneously preserving a high-quality user experience.Abstract This paper proposes a technological framework designed to mitigate the inherent risks associated with the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in decision-making and task execution within the management processes. The Agreement Validation Interface (AVI) functions as a modular Application Programming Interface (API) Gateway positioned between user applications and LLMs. This gateway architecture is designed to be LLM-agnostic, meaning it can operate with various underlying LLMs without requiring specific modifications for each model. This universality is achieved by standardizing the interface for requests and responses and applying a consistent set of validation and enhancement processes irrespective of the chosen LLM provider, thus offering a consistent governance layer across a diverse LLM ecosystem. AVI facilitates the orchestration of multiple AI subcomponents for input-output validation, response evaluation, and contextual reasoning, thereby enabling real-time, bidirectional filtering of user interactions. A proof-of-concept (PoC) implementation of AVI was developed and rigorously evaluated using industry-standard benchmarks. The system was tested for its effectiveness in mitigating adversarial prompts, reducing toxic outputs, detecting personally identifiable information (PII), and enhancing factual consistency. The results demonstrated that AVI reduced successful fast injection attacks by 82%, decreased toxic content generation by 75%, and achieved high PII detection performance (F1-score approximate to 0.95). Furthermore, the contextual reasoning module significantly improved the neutrality and factual validity of model outputs. Although the integration of AVI introduced a moderate increase in latency, the overall framework effectively enhanced the reliability, safety, and interpretability of LLM-driven applications. AVI provides a scalable and adaptable architectural template for the responsible deployment of generative AI in high-stakes domains such as finance, healthcare, and education, promoting safer and more ethical use of AI technologies.

AB  - Objective To train and test a model predicting chronic kidney disease (CKD) using the Generalized Additive(2) Model (GA(2)M), and compare it with other models being obtained with traditional or machine learning approaches. Materials We adopted the Health Search Database (HSD) which is a representative longitudinal database containing electronic healthcare records of approximately 2 million adults. Methods We selected all patients aged 15 years or older being active in HSD between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2020 with no prior diagnosis of CKD. The following models were trained and tested using 20 candidate determinants for incident CKD: logistic regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs), GAM, and GA(2)M. Their prediction performances were compared by calculating Area Under Curve (AUC) and Average Precision (AP). Results Comparing the predictive performances of the 7 models, the AUC and AP for GBM and GA(2)M showed the highest values which were equal to 88.9%, 88.8% and 21.8%, 21.1%, respectively. These 2 models outperformed the others including logistic regression. In contrast to GBMs, GA(2)M kept the interpretability of variable combinations, including interactions and nonlinearities assessment. Discussion Although GA(2)M is slightly less performant than light GBM, it is not "black-box" algorithm, so being simply interpretable using shape and heatmap functions. This evidence supports the fact machine learning techniques should be adopted in case of complex algorithms such as those predicting the risk of CKD. Conclusion The GA(2)M was reliably performant in predicting CKD in primary care. A related decision support system might be therefore implemented.

AB  - Background Personalizing medical treatments based on patient-specific risks and preferences can improve patient health. However, models to support personalized treatment decisions are often complex and difficult to interpret, limiting their clinical application. Methods We present a new method, using machine learning to create meta-models, for simplifying complex models for personalizing medical treatment decisions. We consider simple interpretable models, interpretable ensemble models, and noninterpretable ensemble models. We use variable selection with a penalty for patient-specific risks and/or preferences that are difficult, risky, or costly to obtain. We interpret the meta-models to the extent permitted by their model architectures. We illustrate our method by applying it to simplify a previously developed model for personalized selection of antipsychotic drugs for patients with schizophrenia. Results The best simplified interpretable, interpretable ensemble, and noninterpretable ensemble models contained at most half the number of patient-specific risks and preferences compared with the original model. The simplified models achieved 60.5% (95% credible interval [crI]: 55.2-65.4), 60.8% (95% crI: 55.5-65.7), and 83.8% (95% crI: 80.8-86.6), respectively, of the net health benefit of the original model (quality-adjusted life-years gained). Important variables in all models were similar and made intuitive sense. Computation time for the meta-models was orders of magnitude less than for the original model. Limitations The simplified models share the limitations of the original model (e.g., potential biases). Conclusions Our meta-modeling method is disease- and model- agnostic and can be used to simplify complex models for personalization, allowing for variable selection in addition to improved model interpretability and computational performance. Simplified models may be more likely to be adopted in clinical settings and can help improve equity in patient outcomes.

AB  - Aims Studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic found high occurrence of suicidal thoughts and behaviours (STBs) among healthcare workers (HCWs). The current study aimed to (1) develop a machine learning-based prediction model for future STBs using data from a large prospective cohort of Spanish HCWs and (2) identify the most important variables in terms of contribution to the model's predictive accuracy.Methods This is a prospective, multicentre cohort study of Spanish HCWs active during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 8,996 HCWs participated in the web-based baseline survey (May-July 2020) and 4,809 in the 4-month follow-up survey. A total of 219 predictor variables were derived from the baseline survey. The outcome variable was any STB at the 4-month follow-up. Variable selection was done using an L1 regularized linear Support Vector Classifier (SVC). A random forest model with 5-fold cross-validation was developed, in which the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and undersampling of the majority class balancing techniques were tested. The model was evaluated by the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) curve and the area under the precision-recall curve. Shapley's additive explanatory values (SHAP values) were used to evaluate the overall contribution of each variable to the prediction of future STBs. Results were obtained separately by gender.Results The prevalence of STBs in HCWs at the 4-month follow-up was 7.9% (women = 7.8%, men = 8.2%). Thirty-four variables were selected by the L1 regularized linear SVC. The best results were obtained without data balancing techniques: AUROC = 0.87 (0.86 for women and 0.87 for men) and area under the precision-recall curve = 0.50 (0.55 for women and 0.45 for men). Based on SHAP values, the most important baseline predictors for any STB at the 4-month follow-up were the presence of passive suicidal ideation, the number of days in the past 30 days with passive or active suicidal ideation, the number of days in the past 30 days with binge eating episodes, the number of panic attacks (women only) and the frequency of intrusive thoughts (men only).Conclusions Machine learning-based prediction models for STBs in HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic trained on web-based survey data present high discrimination and classification capacity. Future clinical implementations of this model could enable the early detection of HCWs at the highest risk for developing adverse mental health outcomes.Study registration NCT04556565

AB  - BackgroundGiven that AI-driven decision support systems (AI-DSS) are intended to assist in medical decision making, it is essential that clinicians are willing to incorporate AI-DSS into their practice. This study takes as a case study the use of AI-driven cardiotography (CTG), a type of AI-DSS, in the context of intrapartum care. Focusing on the perspectives of obstetricians and midwives regarding the ethical and trust-related issues of incorporating AI-driven tools in their practice, this paper explores the conditions that AI-driven CTG must fulfill for clinicians to feel justified in incorporating this assistive technology into their decision-making processes regarding interventions in labor.MethodsThis study is based on semi-structured interviews conducted online with eight obstetricians and five midwives based in England. Participants were asked about their current decision-making processes about when to intervene in labor, how AI-driven CTG might enhance or disrupt this process, and what it would take for them to trust this kind of technology. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed with thematic analysis. NVivo software was used to organize thematic codes that recurred in interviews to identify the issues that mattered most to participants. Topics and themes that were repeated across interviews were identified to form the basis of the analysis and conclusions of this paper.ResultsThere were four major themes that emerged from our interviews with obstetricians and midwives regarding the conditions that AI-driven CTG must fulfill: (1) the importance of accurate and efficient risk assessments; (2) the capacity for personalization and individualized medicine; (3) the lack of significance regarding the type of institution that develops technology; and (4) the need for transparency in the development process.ConclusionsAccuracy, efficiency, personalization abilities, transparency, and clear evidence that it can improve outcomes are conditions that clinicians deem necessary for AI-DSS to meet in order to be considered reliable and therefore worthy of being incorporated into the decision-making process. Importantly, healthcare professionals considered themselves as the epistemic authorities in the clinical context and the bearers of responsibility for delivering appropriate care. Therefore, what mattered to them was being able to evaluate the reliability of AI-DSS on their own terms, and have confidence in implementing them in their practice.

AB  - The swift advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT), coupled with the growing application of healthcare software in this area, has given rise to significant worries about the protection and confidentiality of critical health data. To address these challenges, blockchain technology has emerged as a promising solution, providing decentralized and immutable data storage and transparent transaction records. However, traditional blockchain systems still face limitations in terms of preserving data privacy. This paper proposes a novel approach to enhancing privacy preservation in IoT-based healthcare applications using homomorphic encryption techniques combined with blockchain technology. Homomorphic encryption facilitates the performance of calculations on encrypted data without requiring decryption, thus safeguarding the data's privacy throughout the computational process. The encrypted data can be processed and analyzed by authorized parties without revealing the actual contents, thereby protecting patient privacy. Furthermore, our approach incorporates smart contracts within the blockchain network to enforce access control and to define data-sharing policies. These smart contracts provide fine-grained permission settings, which ensure that only authorized entities can access and utilize the encrypted data. These settings protect the data from being viewed by unauthorized parties. In addition, our system generates an audit record of all data transactions, which improves both accountability and transparency. We have provided a comparative evaluation with the standard models, taking into account factors such as communication expense, transaction volume, and security. The findings of our experiments suggest that our strategy protects the confidentiality of the data while at the same time enabling effective data processing and analysis. In conclusion, the combination of homomorphic encryption and blockchain technology presents a solution that is both resilient and protective of users' privacy for healthcare applications integrated with IoT. This strategy offers a safe and open setting for the management and exchange of sensitive patient medical data, while simultaneously preserving the confidentiality of the patients involved.

AB  - Increasing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) represents a global healthcare threat. To decrease the spread of AMR and associated mortality, methods for rapid selection of optimal antibiotic treatment are urgently needed. Machine learning (ML) models based on genomic data to predict resistant phenotypes can serve as a fast screening tool prior to phenotypic testing. Nonetheless, many existing ML methods lack interpretability. Therefore, we present a methodology for visualization of sequence space and AMR prediction based on the non-linear dimensionality reduction method - generative topographic mapping (GTM). This approach, applied to AMR data of >5000 S. aureus isolates retrieved from the PATRIC database, yielded GTM models with reasonable accuracy for all drugs (balanced accuracy values >= 0.75). The Generative Topographic Maps (GTMs) represent data in the form of illustrative maps of the genomic space and allow for antibiotic-wise comparison of resistant phenotypes. The maps were also found to be useful for the analysis of genetic determinants responsible for drug resistance. Overall, the GTM-based methodology is a useful tool for both the illustrative exploration of the genomic sequence space and AMR prediction.

AB  - In the present study, we introduced a novel approach, the dynamic hierarchical pattern learning network (DHPLNet), to assess operators' cognitive workload in a human-machine collaboration setting across multiple individuals using electroencephalogram (EEG) data. The DHPL-Net incorporates a 3-D global feature learning module and a dynamical pattern learning module to capture EEG feature correlations in spatial, statistical, frequency, and temporal domains utilizing position-based adjacency matrices. To enhance generalization across individuals, a regularization term based on Kullback-Leibler divergence and double dropout operations were integrated into the training loss. We developed a new EEG database that includes an N-back task and utilized the publicly available STEW database for algorithm validation. The DHPL-Net achieved 70.11 % accuracy for individual-independent and 97.73 % for individual-dependent binary cognitive workload level recognition in the N-back task. For the STEW database, the accuracies were 78.59 % and 98.77 %, respectively. The results demonstrated that the DHPL-Net exhibited competitive performance and interpretability compared to traditional workload classifiers. The EEG database (N-back) and deep learning models created in this study are publicly accessible (https://github.com/CFSRgroup/NBACK-DHPL) to support further research in EEG-based workload assessment. The proposed lightweight DHPL-Net offers significant potential for real-time cognitive workload assessment in safety-critical human-machine collaboration environments, particularly in aviation, healthcare, and industrial operations. Moreover, this framework can support the development of adaptive systems that dynamically adjust task demands against interference from the individual variability in neurophysiological signals.

AB  - Cancer remains a leading global health issue, where accurate and timely diagnosis is critical for effective treatment. The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), an interconnected network of medical devices, offers realtime multimodal and multi-source data acquisition and analysis, facilitating remote monitoring and improving diagnostic precision. However, IoMT-based diagnostic frameworks face major challenges, including limited computational resources of IoMT devices, difficulties in integrating multimodal data from diverse sources, and the necessity for interpretable models to enhance clinical trust. To address these issues, we propose TinyViT-LightGBM, a lightweight and smart multimodal data fusion framework optimized for breast cancer diagnostics in resource-constrained IoMT environments. TinyViT, an efficient Vision Transformer, extracts features from multi-source histopathology images, combined with mammograms and clinical-genetic data through a comprehensive fusion strategy. By using LightGBM for classification, the framework not only achieves high diagnostic accuracy but also enhances interpretability by identifying the most critical diagnostic features. The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic performance, with 97.8% accuracy, a 6.5% improvement over existing methods, alongside gains in precision (97.2%), recall (99.1%), and F1-score (98.1%). Additionally, its low false positive rate (0.0058) and computational efficiency on IoMT devices underscore its scalability and suitability for real-world healthcare applications.

AB  - Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the foremost cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Recent advancements in machine learning (ML) have demonstrated substantial potential in augmenting risk stratification for primary prevention, surpassing conventional statistical models in predictive performance. Thus, integrating ML with Electronic Health Records (EHRs) enables refined risk estimation by leveraging the granularity and breadth of longitudinal individual patient data. However, fundamental barriers persist, including limited generalizability, challenges in interpretability, and the absence of rigorous external validation, all of which impede widespread clinical deployment. Methods: This review adheres to the methodological rigor of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Scale for the Assessment of Narrative Review Articles (SANRA) guidelines. A systematic literature search was performed in March 2024, encompassing the Medline and Embase databases, to identify studies published since 2010. Supplementary references were retrieved from the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science, and manual searches were curated. The selection process, conducted via Rayyan, focused on systematic and narrative reviews evaluating ML-driven models for long-term CVD risk prediction within primary prevention contexts utilizing EHR data. Studies investigating short-term prognostication, highly specific comorbid cohorts, or conventional models devoid of ML components were excluded. Results: Following an exhaustive screening of 1757 records, 22 studies met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 10 were systematic reviews (four incorporating meta-analyses), while 12 constituted narrative reviews, with the majority published post-2020. The synthesis underscores the superiority of ML in modeling intricate EHR-derived risk factors, facilitating precision-driven cardiovascular risk assessment. Nonetheless, salient challenges endure heterogeneity in CVD outcome definitions, undermine comparability, data incompleteness and inconsistency compromise model robustness, and a dearth of external validation constrains clinical translatability. Moreover, ethical and regulatory considerations, including algorithmic opacity, equity in predictive performance, and the absence of standardized evaluation frameworks, pose formidable obstacles to seamless integration into clinical workflows. Conclusions: Despite the transformative potential of ML-based CVD risk prediction, it remains encumbered by methodological, technical, and regulatory impediments that hinder its full-scale adoption into real-world healthcare settings. This review underscores the imperative circumstances for standardized validation protocols, stringent regulatory oversight, and interdisciplinary collaboration to bridge the translational divide. Our findings established an integrative framework for developing, validating, and applying ML-based CVD risk prediction algorithms, addressing both clinical and technical dimensions. To further advance this field, we propose a standardized, transparent, and regulated EHR platform that facilitates fair model evaluation, reproducibility, and clinical translation by providing a high-quality, representative dataset with structured governance and benchmarking mechanisms.
   Meanwhile, future endeavors must prioritize enhancing model transparency, mitigating biases, and ensuring adaptability to heterogeneous clinical populations, fostering equitable and evidence-based implementation of ML-driven predictive analytics in cardiovascular medicine.

AB  - Background: The development of medical artificial intelligence (AI) models is primarily driven by the need to address healthcare resource scarcity, particularly in underserved regions. Proposing an affordable, accessible, interpretable, and automated AI system for non-clinical settings is crucial to expanding access to quality healthcare. Methods: This cross-sectional study developed the Multimodal Ocular Surface Assessment and Interpretation Copilot (MOSAIC) using three multimodal large language models: gpt-4-turbo, claude-3-opus, and gemini-1.5-pro-latest, for detecting three ocular surface diseases (OSDs) and grading keratitis and pterygium. A total of 375 smartphone-captured ocular surface images collected from 290 eyes were utilized to validate MOSAIC. The performance of MOSAIC was evaluated in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, with tasks including image quality control, OSD detection, analysis of the severity of keratitis, and pterygium grading. The interpretability of the system was also evaluated. Results: MOSAIC achieved 95.00% accuracy in image quality control, 86.96% in OSD detection, 88.33% in distinguishing mild from severe keratitis, and 66.67% in determining pterygium grades with five-shot settings. The performance significantly improved with the increasing learning shots (p < 0.01). The system attained high ROUGE-L F1 scores of 0.70-0.78, depicting its interpretable image comprehension capability. Conclusion: MOSAIC exhibited exceptional few-shot learning capabilities, achieving high accuracy in OSD management with minimal training examples. This system has significant potential for smartphone integration to enhance the accessibility and effectiveness of OSD detection and grading in resource-limited settings.

AB  - Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have been important tools for the extraction of useful knowledge from biological sequences, particularly in healthcare, agriculture, and the environment. However, the categorical and unstructured nature of these sequences requiring usually additional feature engineering steps, before an ML algorithm can be efficiently applied. The addition of these steps to the ML algorithm creates a processing pipeline, known as end -to -end ML. Despite the excellent results obtained by applying end -to -end ML to biotechnology problems, the performance obtained depends on the expertise of the user in the components of the pipeline. In this work, we propose an end -to -end ML -based framework called BioPrediction-RPI, which can identify implicit interactions between sequences, such as pairs of non-coding RNA and proteins, without the need for specialized expertise in end -to -end ML. This framework applies feature engineering to represent each sequence by structural and topological features. These features are divided into feature groups and used to train partial models, whose partial decisions are combined into a final decision, which, provides insights to the user by giving an interpretability report. In our experiments, the developed framework was competitive when compared with various expert-created models. We assessed BioPrediction-RPI with 12 datasets when it presented equal or better performance than all tools in 40% to 100% of cases, depending on the experiment. Finally, BioPrediction-RPI can fine-tune models based on new data and perform at the same level as ML experts, democratizing end -to -end ML and increasing its access to those working in biological sciences.

AB  - This study examines how platform-based artificial intelligence resources (PAIRs) influence sustainable performance in e-business ecosystems by shaping stakeholder cognition and behavior. Guided by the Resource-Based View (RBV), the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), and institutional theory, we examine the psychological mechanisms-particularly trust in AI and environmental identity-that mediate the relationship between PAIRs and green value co-creation (GVC), with sustainable development (SD) acting as a moderating factor. Drawing on survey data from 466 platform managers in China's digital economy hubs (Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta, Beijing-Tianjin), covering diverse industries (e-commerce, consumer goods, healthcare), our data suggest that PAIRs may influence firm performance via GVC, and that this association appears to be stronger under high-SD contexts. Our results underscore the importance of responsible and psychologically informed AI design-such as algorithmic transparency, cognitive load reduction, and ethical calibration-to facilitate stakeholder trust and pro-environmental engagement. This research contributes both theoretically and practically to elucidating how AI integration in e-business can be leveraged for responsible innovation and sustainable value creation.

AB  - The growing trend of high-dimensional problems in multidisciplinary domains such as healthcare, finance, and bioinformatics, highlights the importance of dimensionality reduction techniques to manage data complexity. Among the available approaches, feature selection has been used recurrently, as it enhances the predictive performance and interpretability of machine learning models by selecting a subset of discriminative features. However, traditional feature selection algorithms often struggle with large-scale datasets due to The Curse of Dimensionality. Cooperative co-evolutionary algorithms (CCEAs) emerge as a promising paradigm for feature selection in Big Data. By decomposing a high-dimensional problem into low-dimensional subproblems, they allow subpopulations to evolve independently and collaborate to identify high-quality feature subsets. As the first stage of a CCEA, decomposition significantly impacts optimization, as poorly structured subproblems hinder search efficiency and cause premature convergence. Determining the number of subproblems and their feature allocation is a crucial part of this process - too many subproblems increase computational costs, while too few limit decomposition benefits. Motivated by this, we propose a decomposition strategy that leverages domain knowledge inherent in the data to generate robust subproblems through three stages: discriminative feature projection, feature space reduction, and feature clustering. Throughout these steps, we integrate lowcost parameter tuning mechanisms to optimize the number and size of subproblems, thereby eliminating the need for extensive offline experimentation through complete optimizations. We show that our approach not only relieves users from manual tuning, but also enhances model explainability by achieving more compact solutions, with an average of 32.85% fewer features than baseline methods.

AB  - Causal relationships in a data play vital role in decision making. Identification of causal association in data is one of the important areas of research in data analytics. Simple correlations between data variables reveal the degree of linear relationship. Partial correlation explains the association between two variables within the control of other related variables. Partial association test explains the causality in data. In this paper a couple of causal relationship discovery strategies are proposed using the design of partial association tree that makes use of partial association test among variables. These decision trees are different from normal decision trees in terms of construction, scalability, interpretability and the ability of identifying causality in data. Normal Decision Trees are supervised machine learning approach to classify data based on a labeled attribute values. Variants of partial association trees are constructed as a part of analytics on a number of healthcare datasets. The applicability of design variants are carefully analyzed through this experimentation. In the above said experimentation it is found that the causation in data is not existed in data in some situations and sometimes the existing causality cannot be extracted where low associated dimensions are involved in data and hiding the underlying causality. One of the variants of proposed algorithms which was named dimensionality reduced partial association tree, did well in extracting causal association in case of a hidden causality in data.

AB  - Background Accurate and interpretable clinical code assignment from free-text medical records is a fundamental challenge in healthcare informatics. Traditional machine learning and language model-based methods often lack transparency and struggle with multi-label prediction across complex taxonomies such as ICD, CPT, and LOINC. Existing topic modeling techniques, while interpretable, are rarely optimized for the clinical coding task and fail to leverage the rich semantic structure inherent in medical texts and ontologies. Methods We propose MedConGTM, a novel dual-view graph contrastive topic modeling framework tailored for interpretable and multi-label clinical code prediction. MedConGTM constructs two semantic views of each document: a document-token semantic graph and a document-code co-assignment graph. These views are jointly optimized through a novel dual-view contrastive learning objective that maximizes the mutual information between topic distributions inferred from text and task-specific code views. We introduce a code-aware word co-occurrence graph enhanced with medical ontologies and propose a hierarchy-sensitive contrastive loss that incorporates structural relationships between clinical codes. To ensure transparency, we design a topic-to-code attention decoder that links predicted codes to interpretable latent topics and salient textual evidence. Results Experiments on MIMIC-III and i2b2 datasets demonstrate that MedConGTM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both code prediction accuracy and topic coherence. It also provides interpretable code rationales aligned with clinical semantics. Conclusions MedConGTM offers a powerful, interpretable, and clinically grounded solution for automated ICD/CPT/LOINC code assignment, bridging the gap between topic modeling, contrastive learning, and real-world healthcare applications.

AB  - Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is a valuable modality in the diagnosis and characterization of cardiovascular diseases, since it can identify abnormalities in structure and function of the myocardium non-invasively and without the need for ionizing radiation. However, in clinical practice, it is commonly acquired as a collection of separated and independent 2D image planes, which limits its accuracy in 3D analysis. This paper presents a completely automated pipeline for generating patient-specific 3D biventricular heart models from cine magnetic resonance (MR) slices. Our pipeline automatically selects the relevant cine MR images, segments them using a deep learning-based method to extract the heart contours, and aligns the contours in 3D space correcting possible misalignments due to breathing or subject motion first using the intensity and contours information from the cine data and next with the help of a statistical shape model. Finally, the sparse 3D representation of the contours is used to generate a smooth 3D biventricular mesh. The computational pipeline is applied and evaluated in a CMR dataset of 20 healthy subjects. Our results show an average reduction of misalignment artefacts from 1.82 +/- 1.60 mm to 0.72 +/- 0.73 mm over 20 subjects, in terms of distance from the final reconstructed mesh. The high-resolution 3D biventricular meshes obtained with our computational pipeline are used for simulations of electrical activation patterns, showing agreement with non-invasive electrocardiographic imaging. The automatic methodologies presented here for patient-specific MR imaging-based 3D biventricular representations contribute to the efficient realization of precision medicine, enabling the enhanced interpretability of clinical data, the digital twin vision through patient-specific image-based modelling and simulation, and augmented reality applications. This article is part of the theme issue 'Advanced computation in cardiovascular physiology: new challenges and opportunities'.

AB  - Conductive hydrogel-based sensors have recently garnered significant attention in flexible wearable electronics, artificial intelligence and human-machine interaction due to their remarkable wearability and high conductivity. However, simultaneous realization of superior stretchability, environmental stability, and excellent electrical performance of conductive hydrogels via a simple approach remains a great challenge. Here, an ultrastretchable freezing-tolerant NaCl-based organohydrogel (N-OHG) is developed for health monitoring and gesture recognition. The abundant functional groups of trehalose form covalent-like hydrogen bonds with poly(acrylamide) (PAM)/poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), endowing high conductivity (10.1 S/m), stretchability (5000 %), transparency (78 %), freezing tolerance (-24 degrees C), and environmental stability (over 2 months) of the N-OHG. Furthermore, wearable strain sensor based on the N-OHG demonstrates superior sensitivity (GF=55.9, 0-4000 %) for health monitoring. Furthermore, the stretchable single-electrode-mode triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) based on the N-OHG as working electrode exhibits high output performances even in harsh environment (-24 degrees C). Additionally, leveraging its desirable performance in terms of TENG, a smart glove assembled by five TENG-based sensors has been developed for gesture recognition with high accuracy rate of 99.3 %. Consequently, the proposed N-OHG demonstrates a considerable potential as promising candidates in fields of personal healthcare, medical diagnostics, and human-machine interfaces.

AB  - The challenge of making flexible, standard, and early medical diagnoses is significant. However, some limitations are not fully overcome. First, the diagnosis rules established by medical experts or learned from a trained dataset prove static and too general. It leads to decisions that lack adaptive flexibility when finding new circumstances. Secondly, medical terminological interoperability is highly critical. It increases realism and medical progress and avoids isolated systems and the difficulty of data exchange, analysis, and interpretation. Third, criteria for diagnosis are often heterogeneous and changeable. It includes symptoms, patient history, demographic, treatment, genetics, biochemistry, and imaging. Symptoms represent a high-impact indicator for early detection. It is important that we deal with these symptoms differently, which have a great relationship with semantics, vary widely, and have linguistic information. This negatively affects early diagnosis decision-making. Depending on the circumstances, the diagnosis is made solo on imaging and some medical tests. In this case, although the accuracy of the diagnosis is very high, can these decisions be considered an early diagnosis or prove the condition is deteriorating? Our contribution in this paper is to present a real medical diagnostic system based on semantics, fuzzy, and dynamic decision rules. We attempt to integrate ontology semantics reasoning and fuzzy inference. It promotes fuzzy reasoning and handles knowledge representation problems. In complications and symptoms, ontological semantic reasoning improves the process of evaluating rules in terms of interpretability, dynamism, and intelligence. A real-world case study, ADNI, is presented involving the field of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The proposed system has indicated the possibility of the system to diagnose AD with an accuracy of 97.2%, 95.4%, 94.8%, 93.1%, and 96.3% for AD, LMCI, EMCI, SMC, and CN respectively.

AB  - BackgroundDeep learning has demonstrated significant advancements across various domains. However, its implementation in specialized areas, such as medical settings, remains approached with caution. In these high-stake environments, understanding the model's decision-making process is critical. This study assesses the performance of different pretrained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) models and delves into understanding its decision-making within the context of medical image protocol assignment.MethodsFour different pre-trained BERT models (BERT, BioBERT, ClinicalBERT, RoBERTa) were fine-tuned for the medical image protocol classification task. Word importance was measured by attributing the classification output to every word using a gradient-based method. Subsequently, a trained radiologist reviewed the resulting word importance scores to assess the model's decision-making process relative to human reasoning.ResultsThe BERT model came close to human performance on our test set. The BERT model successfully identified relevant words indicative of the target protocol. Analysis of important words in misclassifications revealed potential systematic errors in the model.ConclusionsThe BERT model shows promise in medical image protocol assignment by reaching near human level performance and identifying key words effectively. The detection of systematic errors paves the way for further refinements to enhance its safety and utility in clinical settings.

AB  - The outbreak of COVID-19 has caused a severe shortage of healthcare resources. Ground Glass Opacity (GGO) and consolidation of chest CT scans have been an essential basis for imaging diagnosis since 2020. The similarity of imaging features between COVID-19 and other pneumonia makes it challenging to distinguish between them and affects radiologists' diagnosis. Recently, deep learning in COVID-19 has been mainly divided into disease classification and lesion segmentation, yet little work has focused on the feature correlation between the two tasks. To address these issues, in this study, we propose MultiR-Net, a 3D deep learning model for combined COVID-19 classification and lesion segmentation, to achieve real-time and interpretable COVID-19 chest CT diagnosis. Precisely, the proposed network consists of two subnets: a multi-scale feature fusion UNet-like subnet for lesion segmentation and a classification subnet for disease diagnosis. The features between the two subnets are fused by the reverse attention mechanism and the iterable training strategy. Meanwhile, we proposed a loss function to enhance the interaction between the two subnets. Individual metrics can not wholly reflect network effectiveness. Thus we quantify the segmentation results with various evaluation metrics such as average surface distance, volume Dice, and test on the dataset. We employ a dataset containing 275 3D CT scans for classifying COVID-19, Community-acquired Pneumonia (CAP), and healthy people and segmented lesions in pneumonia patients. We split the dataset into 70% and 30% for training and testing. Extensive experiments showed that our multi-task model framework obtained an average recall of 93.323%, an average precision of 94.005% on the classification test set, and a 69.95% Volume Dice score on the segmentation test set of our dataset.

AB  - Background: Primary results from randomized clinical trials (RCT) only inform on the average treatment effect in the studied population, and it is critical to understand how treatment effect varies across subpopulations. In this paper we describe a clustering-based approach for the assessment of Heterogeneity of Treatment Effect (HTE) over patient phenotypes, which maintains the unsupervised nature of classical subgroup analysis while jointly accounting for relevant patient characteristics. Methods: We applied phenotype-based stratification in the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial, a non-inferiority trial comparing the effects of higher-dose edoxaban regimen (direct anticoagulant) versus warfarin (vitamin K antagonist) on a composite endpoint of stroke and systemic embolism in 14,062 patients with atrial fibrillation. Results: We identified three distinct phenotypes: non-white participants, mostly from Asia (A); white participants without previous use of vitamin-K antagonists (B); and white participants with previous use of vitamin-K antagonist (C). The effect of the higher-dose edoxaban regimen vs warfarin significantly varied over phenotypes (p for interaction = 0.03) with the strongest benefit in cluster A (HR = 0.72, 95 % CI: 0.52-1.00), moderate effect in cluster B (HR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.61, 1.06) and no observed effect in cluster C (HR = 1.01, 95 % CI: 0.80, 1.27). Conclusions: Assessing HTE over patients' phenotypes might represent a relevant complement to other stratification approaches to elucidate results from subgroups analyses, especially in those settings where an overwhelming superiority overall effect was not observed. Cluster analysis allows a clear discrimination of patients with direct interpretability of who are the patients that would most benefit from the investigated strategy or treatment.

AB  - Background Predictive models in surgery promise to improve clinical care by anticipating complications, guiding decision-making, and supporting personalized treatment strategies. Although their potential to enhance outcomes and efficiency is substantial, their integration into clinical practice also raises profound ethical challenges.Ethical Framework These challenges span the entire lifecycle of predictive models from data collection and development to validation and clinical use. They touch upon patient privacy, algorithmic bias, transparency, and the shifting responsibilities of clinicians. Importantly, the ethical concerns are not isolated to one group but shared across patients, developers, and clinicians within a dynamic stakeholder relationship.Analysis Key risks include biased or unrepresentative datasets, privacy breaches, opaque decision-making processes, and the danger of deskilling surgeons if reliance on algorithms becomes excessive. To mitigate these risks, strategies, such as out-of-distribution detection, standardized data collection, parallel model development, and continuous auditing, are essential. Beyond technical safeguards, embedding predictive models within a framework of accountability and patient-centered care is necessary to sustain trust and equity.Conclusion The integration of predictive models into surgery requires more than technical excellence, and it demands ethical vigilance. Preparing future clinicians through education that emphasizes both clinical reasoning and ethical awareness is critical. By aligning predictive model development with human-centered values, healthcare systems can ensure that these innovations enhance surgical practice while safeguarding equity, transparency, and patient trust.

AB  - The global increase in dementia cases highlights the importance of early detection and intervention, particularly for individuals at risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a precursor to dementia. The aim of this study is to develop and validate machine learning (ML) models based on non-imaging features to predict the risk of MCI conversion in cognitively healthy older adults over a three-year period. Using data from 845 participants aged 65 to 87 years, we built five eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) models of increasing complexity, incorporating demographic, self-reported, medical, and cognitive variables. The models were trained and evaluated using robust preprocessing techniques, including multiple imputation for missing data, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) for class balancing, and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) for interpretability. Model performance improved with the inclusion of cognitive assessments, with the most comprehensive model (Model 5) achieving the highest accuracy (86%) and area under the curve (AUC = 0.8359). Feature importance analysis revealed that variables such as memory tests, depressive symptoms, and age were significant predictors of MCI conversion. In addition, an online risk calculator has been developed and made available free of charge to facilitate clinical use and provide a practical, cost-effective tool for early detection in diverse healthcare settings (https://aimar-project.shinyapps.io/MCI-risk-calculator/). This study highlights the potential of non-imaging ML models for early detection of MCI and emphasizes their accessibility and clinical utility. Future research should focus on validating these models in different populations and examining their integration with personalized intervention strategies to reduce dementia risk.

AB  - Objective The primary objective is to develop an automated method for detecting patients that are ready for discharge from intensive care.
   Design We used two datasets of routinely collected patient data to test and improve on a set of previously proposed discharge criteria.
   Setting Bristol Royal Infirmary general intensive care unit (GICU).
   Patients Two cohorts derived from historical datasets: 1870 intensive care patients from GICU in Bristol, and 7592 from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III.
   Results In both cohorts few successfully discharged patients met all of the discharge criteria. Both a random forest and a logistic classifier, trained using multiple-source cross-validation, demonstrated improved performance over the original criteria and generalised well between the cohorts. The classifiers showed good agreement on which features were most predictive of readiness-for-discharge, and these were generally consistent with clinical experience. By weighting the discharge criteria according to feature importance from the logistic model we showed improved performance over the original criteria, while retaining good interpretability.
   Conclusions Our findings indicate the feasibility of the proposed approach to ready-for-discharge classification, which could complement other risk models of specific adverse outcomes in a future decision support system. Avenues for improvement to produce a clinically useful tool are identified.

AB  - Bayesian network is an increasingly popular method in modeling uncertain and complex problems, because its interpretability is often more useful than plain prediction. To satisfy the core requirement in medical research to obtain interpretable prediction with high accuracy, we constructed an inference engine for post-stroke outcomes based on Bayesian network classifiers. The prediction system that was trained on data of 3,605 patients with acute stroke forecasts the functional independence at 3 months and the mortality 1 year after stroke. Feature selection methods were applied to eliminate less relevant and redundant features from 76 risk variables. The Bayesian network classifiers were trained with a hill-climbing searching for the qualified network structure and parameters measured by maximum description length. We evaluated and optimized the proposed system to increase the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) while ensuring acceptable sensitivity for the class-imbalanced data. The performance evaluation demonstrated that the Bayesian network with selected features by wrapper-type feature selection can predict 3-month functional independence with an AUC of 0.889 using only 19 risk variables and 1-year mortality with an AUC of 0.893 using 24 variables. The Bayesian network with 50 features filtered by information gain can predict 3-month functional independence with an AUC of 0.875 and 1-year mortality with an AUC of 0.895. We also built an online prediction service, Yonsei Stroke Outcome Inference System, to substantialize the proposed solution for patients with stroke.

AB  - Objective: Given the limited accessibility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for diagnosing cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) in community settings and the lack of practical early risk assessment tools, we aimed to develop and validate an interpretable machine learning (ML) model using non-imaging routine clinical data to identify individuals at high risk of CSVD and its imaging subgroups (lacunes and white matter hyperintensities [WMH]). Methods: Data were retrospectively collected from 1,489 participants in two community-based regions of China, with CSVD diagnosed by 0.35 T mobile MRI. Data were split into development and external validation cohorts. Recursive feature elimination (RFE) was employed for predictor selection, and five ML models (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, Light Gradient Boosting Machine [LightGBM]) were developed and compared using nested five-fold cross-validation. Model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), accuracy, F1 score, and balanced accuracy. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) enhanced interpretability. The best-performing model was integrated with predictors selected through sequential forward selection (SFS) to build a web-based application. Results: The best-performing LightGBM model, evaluated across the outer folds of nested five-fold cross-validation, achieved an AUROC of 0.937 +/- 0.003. In the test set, it demonstrated an AUROC of 0.862 (95 % CI 0.795-0.930). External validation in a geographically distinct region confirmed moderate generalizability with an AUROC of 0.761 (95 % CI 0.721-0.801). Among the 19 selected interpretable features, the top 10 features, age, uric acid, body mass index, creatinine, waist circumference, estimated glomerular filtration rate, fasting blood glucose, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, homocysteine, and diastolic blood pressure, were integrated into a web-based calculator. Conclusions: This study developed a reliable and interpretable LightGBM model, based on routine clinical data, offering a practical CSVD screening tool for community healthcare. Its web-based deployment provides valuable support for cerebrovascular prevention and early intervention, addressing current MRI accessibility limitations.

AB  - Bayesian networks (BNs) are graphical models representing uncertainty in causal discovery, and have been widely used in medical diagnosis and gene analysis due to their effectiveness and good interpretability. However, mainstream BN structure learning methods are computationally expensive, as they must perform numerous conditional independence (CI) tests to decide the existence of edges. Some researchers attempt to accelerate the learning process by parallelism, but face issues including load unbalancing, costly dominant parallelism overhead. We propose a multi-thread method, namely Fast-BNS version 1 (Fast-BNS-v1 for short), on multi-core CPUs to enhance the efficiency of the BN structure learning. Fast-BNS-v1 incorporates a series of efficiency optimizations, including a dynamic work pool for better scheduling, grouping CI tests to avoid unnecessary operations, a cache-friendly data storage to improve memory efficiency, and on-the-fly conditioning sets generation to avoid extra memory consumption. To further boost learning performance, we develop a two-level parallel method Fast-BNS-v2 by integrating edge-level parallelism with multi-processes and CI-level parallelism with multi-threads. Fast-BNS-v2 is equipped with careful optimizations including dynamic work stealing for load balancing, SIMD edge list deletion for list updating, and effective communication policies for synchronization. Comprehensive experiments show that our Fast-BNS achieves 9 to 235 times speedup over the state-of-the-art multi-threaded method on a single machine. When running on multi-machines, it further reduces the execution time of the single-machine implementation by 80%.

AB  - The application of in silico medicine is constantly growing in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases. These technologies allow us to support medical decisions and self-management and reduce, refine, and partially replace real studies of medical technologies. In silico medicine may challenge some key principles: transparency and fairness of data usage; data privacy and protection across platforms and systems; data availability and quality; data integration and interoperability; intellectual property; data sharing; equal accessibility for persons and populations. Several social, ethical, and legal issues may consequently arise from its adoption. In this work, we provide an overview of these issues along with some practical suggestions for their assessment from a health technology assessment perspective. We performed a narrative review with a search on MEDLINE/Pubmed, ISI Web of Knowledge, Scopus, and Google Scholar. The following key aspects emerge as general reflections with an impact on the operational level: cultural resistance, level of expertise of users, degree of patient involvement, infrastructural requirements, risks for health, respect of several patients' rights, potential discriminations for access and use of the technology, and intellectual property of innovations. Our analysis shows that several challenges still need to be debated to allow in silico medicine to express all its potential in healthcare processes.

AB  - As populations age globally, governments face mounting challenges in reconfiguring healthcare and housing systems to support aging-in-place. This study offers a comparative analysis of South Korea and the United Kingdom, examining how each country integrates digital technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), telecare, and smart housing systems, into their aging strategies. South Korea employs a centralized, technology-driven approach that prioritizes the national rollout of AI-enabled smart homes and digital health infrastructure. In contrast, the UK advances a decentralized, community-based model emphasizing social housing, localized care delivery, and telecare integration. Despite these differing trajectories, both nations face shared limitations, including high implementation costs, digital literacy barriers, and concerns about data privacy. Critically, the study finds that the success of aging-in-place efforts is shaped not only by technological capacity but also by governance dynamics, political continuity, and institutional coordination. In response, the paper proposes policy recommendations alongside an ethical framework grounded in transparency, autonomy, informed consent, and equity. Sustainable aging-in-place strategies require not only innovative technologies, but also inclusive governance and ethically robust design to ensure accessibility, trust, and long-term impact.

AB  - Interpreting complex clinical time series is vital for patient safety and care, as it is both essential for supporting accurate clinical assessment and fundamental to building clinician trust and promoting effective clinical action. In complex time series analysis, decomposing a signal into meaningful underlying components is often a crucial means for achieving interpretability. This process is known as time series disentanglement. While deep learning models excel in predictive performance in this domain, their inherent complexity poses a major challenge to interpretability. Furthermore, existing time series disentanglement methods, including traditional trend or seasonality decomposition techniques, struggle to adequately separate clinically crucial specific components: static patient characteristics, condition trend, and acute events. Thus, a key technical challenge remains: developing an interpretable method capable of effectively disentangling these specific components in complex clinical time series. To address this challenge, we propose CoTD-VAE, a novel variational autoencoder framework for interpretable component disentanglement. CoTD-VAE incorporates temporal constraints tailored to the properties of static, trend, and event components, such as leveraging a Trend Smoothness Loss to capture gradual changes and an Event Sparsity Loss to identify potential acute events. These designs help the model effectively decompose time series into dedicated latent representations. We evaluate CoTD-VAE on critical care (MIMIC-IV) and human activity recognition (UCI HAR) datasets. Results demonstrate successful component disentanglement and promising performance enhancement in downstream tasks. Ablation studies further confirm the crucial role of our proposed temporal constraints. CoTD-VAE offers a promising interpretable framework for analyzing complex time series in critical applications like healthcare.

TI  - Prediction of coronary artery bypass graft outcomes using a single surgical note: An artificial intelligence-based prediction model study
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Background Healthcare providers currently calculate risk of the composite outcome of morbidity or mortality associated with a coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery through manual input of variables into a logistic regression-based risk calculator. This study indicates that automated artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques can instead calculate risk. Specifically, we present novel numerical embedding techniques that enable NLP (natural language processing) models to achieve higher performance than the risk calculator using a single preoperative surgical note.Methods The most recent preoperative surgical consult notes of 1,738 patients who received an isolated CABG from July 1, 2014 to November 1, 2022 at a single institution were analyzed. The primary outcome was the Society of Thoracic Surgeons defined composite outcome of morbidity or mortality (MM). We tested three numerical-embedding techniques on the widely used TextCNN classification model: 1a) Basic embedding, treat numbers as word tokens; 1b) Basic embedding with a dataloader that Replaces out-of-context (ROOC) numbers with a tag, where context is defined as within a number of tokens of specified keywords; 2) ScaleNum, an embedding technique that scales in-context numbers via a learned sigmoid-linear-log function; and 3) AttnToNum, a ScaleNum-derivative that updates the ScaleNum embeddings via multi-headed attention applied to local context. Predictive performance was measured via area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) on holdout sets from 10 random-split experiments. For eXplainable-AI (X-AI), we calculate SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values at an ngram resolution (SHAP-N). While the analyses focus on TextCNN, we execute an analogous performance pipeline with a long short-term memory (LSTM) model to test if the numerical embedding advantage is robust to model architecture.Results A total of 567 (32.6%) patients had MM following CABG. The embedding performances are as follows with the TextCNN architecture: 1a) Basic, mean AUC 0.788 [95% CI (confidence interval): 0.768-0.809]; 1b) ROOC, 0.801 [CI: 0.788-0.815]; 2) ScaleNum, 0.808 [CI: 0.785-0.821]; and 3) AttnToNum, 0.821 [CI: 0.806-0.834]. The LSTM architecture produced a similar trend. Permutation tests indicate that AttnToNum outperforms the other embedding techniques, though not statistically significant verse ScaleNum (p-value of .07). SHAP-N analyses indicate that the model learns to associate low blood urine nitrate (BUN) and creatinine values with survival. A correlation analysis of the attention-updated numerical embeddings indicates that AttnToNum learns to incorporate both number magnitude and local context to derive semantic similarities.Conclusion This research presents both quantitative and clinical novel contributions. Quantitatively, we contribute two new embedding techniques: AttnToNum and ScaleNum. Both can embed strictly positive and bounded numerical values, and both surpass basic embeddings in predictive performance. The results suggest AttnToNum outperforms ScaleNum. With regards to clinical research, we show that AI methods can predict outcomes after CABG using a single preoperative note at a performance that matches or surpasses the current risk calculator. These findings reveal the potential role of NLP in automated registry reporting and quality improvement.

AB  - With the tremendous successes of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT for text generation and Dall-E for high-quality image generation, generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models have shown a hype in our society. Generative AI seamlessly delved into different aspects of society ranging from economy, education, legislation, computer science, finance, and even healthcare. This article provides a comprehensive survey on the increased and promising use of generative AI in assistive technologies benefiting different parties, ranging from the assistive system developers, medical practitioners, care workforce, to the people who need the care and the comfort. Ethical concerns, biases, lack of transparency, insufficient explainability, and limited trustworthiness are major challenges when using generative AI in assistive technologies, particularly in systems that impact people directly. Key future research directions to address these issues include creating standardized rules, establishing commonly accepted evaluation metrics and benchmarks for explainability and reasoning processes, and making further advancements in understanding and reducing bias and its potential harms. Beyond showing the current trends of applying generative AI in the scope of assistive technologies in four identified key domains, which include care sectors, medical sectors, helping people in need, and co-working, the survey also discusses the current limitations and provides promising future research directions to foster better integration of generative AI in assistive technologies.

KW  - CLINICAL-DIAGNOSIS
AB  - Background Skin cancer is the most common cancer worldwide. Early diagnosis is crucial to improving patient survival and morbidity. Artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted smartphone applications (apps) for skin cancer potentially offer accessible, early risk assessment of suspicious skin lesions. However, the integration of novel technologies into dermatology pathways raises ethical concerns. Although ethical principles for AI governance are well known, how these principles should be applied to real-life AI apps readily available for public use is less well understood.Objectives To conduct an ethical use-case analysis of commercially available skin cancer apps, to better understand the ethical issues arising from their development and use in a real-world context.Methods Established methods for the ethical analysis of clinical AI applications were applied to two popular skin cancer apps in the UK: SkinVision and Scanoma. Systematic searches of published literature, regulatory documents and websites were conducted to review the evidence regarding app development, effectiveness and use. Screening for inclusion was undertaken by two researchers independently. Ethical concerns were identified with reference to previously described ethical concerns and principles for AI-assisted healthcare.Results By conceptualizing ethical principles within the use-context of skin cancer apps, we identified specific ethical issues arising throughout the AI lifecycle of both apps. One company provided extensive detail regarding algorithm development and decision-making; this information was insufficiently reported for the other app. Other concerns identified were related to number, quality and consistency of studies assessing algorithm efficacy. Limited efforts to address potential skin tone biases and the exclusion of individuals with darker skin tones as target users by one app risks perpetuating existing inequalities. Inadequate regulatory oversight was identified.Conclusions Findings from our ethical use-case analysis of two patient-facing AI-assisted skin cancer apps suggest inadequate incorporation of bioethical norms such as justice, responsibility and transparency into the development and deployment of both apps. Improved regulation should increase accountability. Ensuring ethics by design through integration between technology developers, dermatologists, ethicists and the public is urgently needed to prevent the potential benefits of AI-assisted skin cancer apps being overshadowed by potential ethical harms.

Our findings suggest inadequate incorporation of bioethical norms such as justice, responsibility and transparency into the development and deployment of both apps, which can have significant impacts in the context of skin cancer. These findings emphasize the need for better integration of ethical principles and improved regulation to ensure the safe development and use of AI-assisted technologies in dermatology.

AB  - Within the framework of precision medicine, the stratification of individual genetic susceptibility based on inherited DNA variation has paramount relevance. However, one of the most relevant pitfalls of traditional Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) approaches is their inability to model complex high-order non-linear SNP-SNP interactions and their effect on the phenotype (e.g. epistasis). Indeed, they incur in a computational challenge as the number of possible interactions grows exponentially with the number of SNPs considered, affecting the statistical reliability of the model parameters as well. In this work, we address this issue by proposing a novel PRS approach, called High-order Interactions-aware Polygenic Risk Score (hiPRS), that incorporates high-order interactions in modeling polygenic risk. The latter combines an interaction search routine based on frequent itemsets mining and a novel interaction selection algorithm based on Mutual Information, to construct a simple and interpretable weighted model of user-specified dimensionality that can predict a given binary phenotype. Compared to traditional PRSs methods, hiPRS does not rely on GWAS summary statistics nor any external information. Moreover, hiPRS differs from Machine Learning-based approaches that can include complex interactions in that it provides a readable and interpretable model and it is able to control overfitting, even on small samples. In the present work we demonstrate through a comprehensive simulation study the superior performance of hiPRS w.r.t. state of the art methods, both in terms of scoring performance and interpretability of the resulting model. We also test hiPRS against small sample size, class imbalance and the presence of noise, showcasing its robustness to extreme experimental settings. Finally, we apply hiPRS to a case study on real data from DACHS cohort, defining an interaction-aware scoring model to predict mortality of stage II-III Colon-Rectal Cancer patients treated with oxaliplatin.

AB  - Medication recommendation is a productive task for AI-driven healthcare systems, which can assist clinicians in prescribing judicious and effective treatments. However, existing medication recommendation methods omit two key pieces of information: Coarse-grained interaction information between distinct types of symptoms in a patient's medical history and corresponding medication representations can serve as attention for predicting the current medication combinations of the patient. Fine-grained interaction information between medication substructure representations and different types of symptoms can facilitate the construction of molecular-level disentangled medication representations. To address this dilemma, we propose a novel Dual Adaptive Interaction Network (DAI-Net), which encodes comprehensive interaction knowledge between patients' multifaceted health records and medication molecules to improve the performance of medication recommendation and heighten interpretability of the model. Specifically, we design a symptom-aware medication matching module to extract coordinated associations between patient symptoms and medication molecules, coarse-grained interaction learning. The medication embeddings are utilized to transform patient-medication matching properties into a symptom-substructure matching matrix for fine-grained interaction. The patient's Longitudinal representation is employed as a query to decode both symptom-medication and symptom-substructure matching information for coordinated medication representation. DAI-Net is an end-to-end recommendation model. Extensive experiments on the real-world EHR datasets, i.e., the public benchmark MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, and eICU, demonstrate that the proposed DAI-Net achieves competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art ones, with an average improvement of 1.8%, 2.1% in Jaccard on MIMIC-III and -IV dataset.

AB  - Accurate lesion segmentation in medical imaging is critical for medical diagnosis and treatment. Lesions' diverse and heterogeneous characteristics often present a distinct long-tail distribution, posing difficulties for automatic methods. Currently, interactive segmentation approaches have shown promise in improving accuracy, but still struggle to deal with tail features. This triggers a demand of effective utilizing strategies of user interaction. To this end, we propose a novel point-based interactive segmentation model called Clustering-Aided Interactive Segmentation Network (CAISeg) in 3D medical imaging. A customized Interaction-Guided Module (IGM) adopts the concept of clustering to capture features that are semantically similar to interaction points. These clustered features are then mapped to the head regions of the prompted category to facilitate more precise classification. Meanwhile, we put forward a Focus Guided Loss function to grant the network an inductive bias towards user interaction through assigning higher weights to voxels closer to the prompted points, thereby improving the responsiveness efficiency to user guidance. Evaluation across brain tumor, colon cancer, lung cancer, and pancreas cancer segmentation tasks show CAISeg's superiority over the state-of-the-art methods. It outperforms the fully automated segmentation models in accuracy, and achieves results comparable to or better than those of the leading point-based interactive methods while requiring fewer prompt points. Furthermore, we discover that CAISeg possesses good interpretability at various stages, which endows CAISeg with potential clinical application value.

TI  - A critical analysis of Discovery Health's claims-based risk adjustment of mortality rates in South African private sector hospitals
T2  - SAMJ SOUTH AFRICAN MEDICAL JOURNAL

KW  - ADMINISTRATIVE DATA
KW  - PREDICTION MODEL
AB  - In 2019, Discovery Health published a risk adjustment model to determine standardised mortality rates across South African private hospital systems, with the aim of contributing towards quality improvement in the private healthcare sector. However, the model suffers from limitations due to its design and its reliance on administrative data. The publication's aim of facilitating transparency is unfortunately undermined by shortcomings in reporting. When designing a risk prediction model, patient-proximate variables with a sound theoretical or proven association with the outcome of interest should be used. The addition of key condition-specific clinical data points at the time of hospital admission will dramatically improve model performance. Performance could be further improved by using summary risk prediction scores such as the EUROSCORE II for coronary artery bypass graft surgery or the GRACE risk score for acute coronary syndrome. In general, model reporting should conform to published reporting standards, and attempts should be made to test model validity by using sensitivity analyses. In particular, the limitations of machine learning prediction models should be understood, and these models should be appropriately developed, evaluated and reported.

AB  - BackgroundArtificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized various healthcare domains, where AI algorithms sometimes even outperform human specialists. However, the field of clinical ethics has remained largely untouched by AI advances. This study explores the attitudes of anesthesiologists and internists towards the use of AI-driven preference prediction tools to support ethical decision-making for incapacitated patients.MethodsA questionnaire was developed and pretested among medical students. The questionnaire was distributed to 200 German anesthesiologists and 200 German internists, thereby focusing on physicians who often encounter patients lacking decision-making capacity. The questionnaire covered attitudes toward AI-driven preference prediction, availability and utilization of Clinical Ethics Support Services (CESS), and experiences with ethically challenging situations. Descriptive statistics and bivariate analysis was performed. Qualitative responses were analyzed using content analysis in a mixed inductive-deductive approach.ResultsParticipants were predominantly male (69.3%), with ages ranging from 27 to 77. Most worked in nonacademic hospitals (82%). Physicians generally showed hesitance toward AI-driven preference prediction, citing concerns about the loss of individuality and humanity, lack of explicability in AI results, and doubts about AI's ability to encompass the ethical deliberation process. In contrast, physicians had a more positive opinion of CESS. Availability of CESS varied, with 81.8% of participants reporting access. Among those without access, 91.8% expressed a desire for CESS.Physicians' reluctance toward AI-driven preference prediction aligns with concerns about transparency, individuality, and human-machine interaction. While AI could enhance the accuracy of predictions and reduce surrogate burden, concerns about potential biases, de-humanisation, and lack of explicability persist.ResultsParticipants were predominantly male (69.3%), with ages ranging from 27 to 77.

Addressing concerns about individuality, explicability, and human-machine roles may facilitate the acceptance of AI in clinical ethics. Further research into patient and surrogate perspectives is needed to ensure AI aligns with patient preferences and values in complex medical decisions.

AB  - Objectives: Clinical molecular genetic testing and molecular imaging dramatically increase the quantity of clinical data. Combined with the extensive application of electronic health records, a medical data ecosystem is forming, which calls for big-data-based medicine models. We tried to use big data analytics to search for similar patients in a cancer cohort, showing how to apply artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to clinical data processing to obtain clinically significant results, with the ultimate goal of improving healthcare management. Methods: In order to overcome the weaknesses of most data processing algorithms that rely on expert labeling and annotation, we uniformly adopted one-hot encoding for all types of clinical data, calculating the Euclidean distance to measure patient similarity and subgrouping via an unsupervised learning model. Overall survival (OS) was investigated to assess the clinical validity and clinical relevance of the model. Results: We took gastric cancers (GCs) as an example to build a high-dimensional clinical patient similarity network (cPSN). When performing the survival analysis, we found that Cluster_2 had the longest survival rates, while Cluster_5 had the worst prognosis among all the subgroups. As patients in the same subgroup share some clinical characteristics, the clinical feature analysis found that Cluster_2 harbored more lower distal GCs than upper proximal GCs, shedding light on the debates. Conclusion: Overall, we constructed a cancer-specific cPSN with excellent interpretability and clinical significance, which would recapitulate patient similarity in the real-world. The constructed cPSN model is scalable, generalizable, and performs well for various data types.

AB  - Lack of standardization is highly visible while we use historical data sets or compare our model with others that use IoMT devices from different vendors. The problem also concerns the trust in highly decentralized and anonymous environments where sensitive data are transferred through the Internet and then are analyzed by third-party companies. In our research we propose a standard that has been implemented in the form of framework that allows describing requirements for methods and platforms that collect, manage, share, and perform data analysis form the Internet of Medical Things in order to increase trust. Further, we can distinguish two types of IoMT devices: passive and active. Passive devices measure some parameters of the body and save them in databases. Active devices have the functionality of passive devices and moreover, they can act in a defined way, eg.: inject directly into the patient's body some elements such as a medicament, electric signals to the nervous system, stimulus pacemaker, etc. Nevertheless how to create a safe and transparent environment for using data active sensors, developing safe ML models, performing medical decisions based on the created models and finally deploy this decision to the specified device. While the IoMT devices are used in real-life, professional healthcare the control system should offer tools for backtracking decisions, allowing e.g. to find who made a mistake, or which event caused a particular decision. Our framework provides backtracking in the IoMT environment in which for each medical decision supported by ML models we can prove which sensor sends the data, which data was used to create prediction/recommendation, what prediction was produced, who and when use it, what medical decision was made by who. We propose a vendor transparency framework for each IoMT devices and ML models that will process the medical data in order to increase patient's privacy and prevent for eventual data leaking.

AB  - Background The rapid adoption of digital skin imaging applications has increased the utilization of smartphone-acquired images in dermatology. While this has enormous potential for scaling the assessment of concerning skin lesions, the insufficient quality of many consumer/patient-taken images can undermine clinical accuracy and potentially harm patients due to lack of diagnostic interpretability. We aim to characterize the current state of digital skin imaging applications and comprehensively assess how image acquisition features address image quality. Materials and methods Publicly discoverable mobile, web, and desktop-based skin imaging applications, identified through keyword searches in mobile app stores, Google Search queries, previous teledermatology studies, and expert recommendations were independently assessed by three reviewers. Applications were categorized by primary audience (consumer-facing, nonhospital-based practice, or enterprise/health system), function (education, store-and-forward teledermatology, live-interactive teledermatology, electronic medical record adjunct/clinical imaging storage, or clinical triage), in-app connection to a healthcare provider (yes or no), and user type (patient, provider, or both). Results Just over half (57%) of 191 included skin imaging applications had at least one of 14 image acquisition technique features. Those that were consumer-facing, intended for educational use, and designed for both patient and physician users had significantly greater feature richness (p < 0.05). The most common feature was the inclusion of text-based imaging tips, followed by the requirement to submit multiple images and body area matching. Conclusion Very few skin imaging applications included more than one image acquisition technique feature. Feature richness varied significantly by audience, function, and user categories. Users of digital dermatology tools should consider which applications have standardized features that improve image quality.

AB  - Mass spectrometry data processing and feature extraction are vital in drug analysis, particularly for ensuring drug quality and safety. These techniques allow for the detailed identification and quantification of chemical compounds within pharmaceutical products, supporting the detection of impurities, active ingredients, and potential contaminants. Data mining algorithms enhance this process by sifting through large datasets, identifying patterns, and extracting key features that are critical for quality control. Algorithms such as clustering, classification, and anomaly detection can isolate relevant data points, aiding in precise compound characterization. By automating the extraction of critical features from complex spectra, data mining facilitates faster and more accurate quality assessment, reducing human error and enhancing compliance with regulatory standards. This paper introduces Ethereum Blockchain Clustering (EBC) as a novel approach to drug quality assessment in the pharmaceutical industry. Leveraging the capabilities of blockchain technology and mass spectrometry data analysis, EBC offers a transparent and decentralized platform for managing and analyzing drug quality attributes. Through a series of simulations and case studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of EBC in categorizing drug samples, extracting relevant features, and assessing their potency, purity, and stability. The results highlight the potential of EBC to enhance transparency, traceability, and trust within the pharmaceutical supply chain, ultimately contributing to improved patient safety and healthcare outcomes. in our simulations, we observe mean drug potency values ranging from 97.8% to 99.2%, mean drug purity values ranging from 95.1% to 97.8%, and mean drug stability ranging from 23.2 to 25.8 months across different scenarios and clusters. These results highlight the potential of EBC to enhance transparency, traceability, and trust within the pharmaceutical supply chain, ultimately contributing to improved patient safety and healthcare outcomes.

AB  - Deep learning (DL) requires large amounts of labeled data, which is extremely time-consuming and labor-intensive to obtain for medical image segmentation tasks. Meta-learning focuses on developing learning strategies that enable quick adaptation to new tasks with limited labeled data. However, rich-class medical image segmentation datasets for constructing meta-learning multi-tasks are currently unavailable. In addition, data collected from various healthcare sites and devices may present significant distribution differences, potentially degrading model's performance. In this paper, we propose a task augmentation-based meta-learning method for retinal image segmentation (TAMS) to meet labor-intensive annotation demand. A retinal Lesion Simulation Algorithm (LSA) is proposed to automatically generate multi-class retinal disease datasets with pixel-level segmentation labels, such that meta-learning tasks can be augmented without collecting data from various sources. In addition, a novel simulation function library is designed to control generation process and ensure interpretability. Moreover, a generative simulation network (GSNet) with an improved adversarial training strategy is introduced to maintain high-quality representations of complex retinal diseases. TAMS is evaluated on three different OCT and CFP image datasets, and comprehensive experiments have demonstrated that TAMS achieves superior segmentation performance than state-of-the-art models.

AB  - Background: Accurately assessing perioperative risk is critical for informed surgical planning and patient safety. However, current prediction models often rely on structured data and overlook the nuanced clinical reasoning embedded in free-text preoperative notes. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened opportunities for harnessing unstructured clinical data, yet their application in perioperative prediction remains limited by concerns about factual accuracy. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers a promising solution-enhancing LLM performance by grounding outputs in domain-specific knowledge sources, potentially improving both predictive accuracy and clinical interpretability. Objective: This study aimed to investigate whether integrating LLMs with RAG can improve the prediction of 30-day postoperative mortality and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification using unstructured preoperative clinical notes. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using 24,491 medical records from a tertiary medical center, including preoperative anesthesia assessments, discharge summaries, and surgical information. To extract clinical insights from free-text data, we used the LLaMA 3.1-8B language model with RAG, using MedEmbed for text embedding and Miller's Anesthesia as the primary retrieval source. We evaluated model performance under various configurations, including embedding models, chunk sizes, and few-shot prompting. Machine learning (ML) models, including random forest, support vector machines (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and logistic regression, were trained on structured features as baselines. Results: A total of 520 (2.1%) patients experienced in-hospital 30-day postoperative mortality. The ASA physical status distribution wasasfollows: class I: 535 (2.2%); class II: 15,272 (62.4%); class III: 8024 (32.8%); class IV: 606 (2.5%); andclass V: 54 (0.22%). For 30-day postoperativemortality prediction, the LLaMA-RAG model achieved an F1-score of 0.4663 (95% CI 0.4654-0.4672), versus 0.2369 (95% CI 0.2341-0.2397) without few-shot prompting, 0.0879 (95% CI 0.0717-0.1041) without RAG, and 0.0436 (95% CI 0.0292-0.0580) without either few-shot prompting or RAG. Among ML models, XGBoost scored 0.4459 (95% CI 0.4176-0.4742); random forest, 0.3953 (95% CI 0.3791-0.4115); logistic regression, 0.2720 (95% CI 0.2647-0.2793); and SVM, 0.2474 (95% CI 0.2275-0.2673). For ASA classification, LLaMA-RAG achieveda micro F1-score of 0.8409 (95% CI 0.8238-0.8551) versus 0.6546 (95% CI 0.6430-0.6796) without few-shot prompting, 0.6340 (95% CI 0.6157-0.6535) without RAG, and 0.4238 (95% CI 0.3952-0.4490) without either few-shot prompting or RAG. In comparison, XGBoostachieved 0.8273 (95% CI 0.8209-0.8498); logistic regression, 0.7940 (95% CI 0.7671-0.7950); randomforest, 0.7847 (95% CI 0.7637-0.7868); and SVM, 0.7697 (95% CI 0.7637-0.7697). Notably, the model demonstrated exceptional sensitivity in identifying rare but high-risk cases, such as ASA Class 5 patients and postoperative deaths. Conclusions:The LLaMA-RAG model significantly improved the prediction of postoperativemortality and ASA classification, especially for rare high-risk cases. By grounding outputs in domain knowledge, retrieval-augmented generation enhanced both accuracy and prompt-driven interpretability over ML and ablation models-highlighting its promise for real-world clinical decision support.

AB  - Background: Due to its convenience, wide availability, low usage cost, neural machine translation (NMT) has increasing applications in diverse clinical settings and web-based self-diagnosis of diseases. Given the developing nature of NMT tools, this can pose safety risks to multicultural communities with limited bilingual skills, low education, and low health literacy. Research is needed to scrutinise the reliability, credibility, usability of automatically translated patient health information.Objective: We aimed to develop high-performing Bayesian machine learning classifiers to assist clinical professionals and healthcare workers in assessing the quality and usability of NMT on depressive disorders. The tool did not require any prior knowledge from frontline health and medical professionals of the target language used by patients.Methods: We used Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) to increase generalisability and clinical interpretability of classifiers. It is a typical sparse Bayesian classifier less prone to overfitting with small training datasets. We optimised RVM by leveraging automatic recursive feature elimination and expert feature refinement from the perspective of health linguistics. We evaluated the diagnostic utility of the Bayesian classifier under different probability cut-offs in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios against clinical thresholds for diagnostic tests. Finally, we illustrated interpretation of RVM tool in clinic using Bayes' nomogram.Results: After automatic and expert-based feature optimisation, the best-performing RVM classifier (RVM_DUFS12) gained the highest AUC (0.8872) among 52 competing models with distinct optimised, normalised features sets. It also had statistically higher sensitivity and specificity compared to other models. We evaluated the diagnostic utility of the best-performing model using Bayes' nomogram: it had a positive likelihood ratio (LR+) of 4.62 (95% C.I.: 2.53, 8.43), and the associated posterior probability (odds) was 83% (5.0) (95% C.I.: 73%, 90%), meaning that approximately 10 in 12 English texts with positive test are likely to contain information that would cause clinically significant conceptual errors if translated by Google; it had a negative likelihood ratio (LR-) of 0.18 (95% C.I.: 0.10,0.35) and associated posterior probability (odds) was 16% (0.2) (95% C.I: 10%, 27%), meaning that about 10 in 12 English texts with negative test can be safely translated using Google.

AB  - BackgroundThe availability of massive amount of data enables the possibility of clinical predictive tasks. Deep learning methods have achieved promising performance on the tasks. However, most existing methods suffer from three limitations: (1) There are lots of missing value for real value events, many methods impute the missing value and then train their models based on the imputed values, which may introduce imputation bias. The models' performance is highly dependent on the imputation accuracy. (2) Lots of existing studies just take Boolean value medical events (e.g. diagnosis code) as inputs, but ignore real value medical events (e.g., lab tests and vital signs), which are more important for acute disease (e.g., sepsis) and mortality prediction. (3) Existing interpretable models can illustrate which medical events are conducive to the output results, but are not able to give contributions of patterns among medical events.MethodsIn this study, we propose a novel interpretable Pattern Attention model with Value Embedding (PAVE) to predict the risks of certain diseases. PAVE takes the embedding of various medical events, their values and the corresponding occurring time as inputs, leverage self-attention mechanism to attend to meaningful patterns among medical events for risk prediction tasks. Because only the observed values are embedded into vectors, we don't need to impute the missing values and thus avoids the imputations bias. Moreover, the self-attention mechanism is helpful for the model interpretability, which means the proposed model can output which patterns cause high risks.ResultsWe conduct sepsis onset prediction and mortality prediction experiments on a publicly available dataset MIMIC-III and our proprietary EHR dataset. The experimental results show that PAVE outperforms existing models. Moreover, by analyzing the self-attention weights, our model outputs meaningful medical event patterns related to mortality.ConclusionsPAVE learns effective medical event representation by incorporating the values and occurring time, which can improve the risk prediction performance. Moreover, the presented self-attention mechanism can not only capture patients' health state information, but also output the contributions of various medical event patterns, which pave the way for interpretable clinical risk predictions.AvailabilityThe code for this paper is available at: https://github.com/yinchangchang/PAVE.

AB  - Introduction: Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC) exhibits high incidence in southern China. Despite improved survival with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), 10%-20% of patients experience local recurrence. Traditional TNM staging fails to reflect tumor heterogeneity, necessitating robust recurrence prediction models. This study aimed to develop an MRI-based NPC recurrence prediction model by integrating radiomics, deep learning, and clinical features. Methods: A total of 184 pathologically confirmed NPC patients receiving radical radiotherapy were included. After propensity score matching (1:1), 136 cases were analyzed. Stacked denoising autoencoder (SDAE) extracted deep features from contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI. Radiomic features (morphology, texture, first-order statistics), clinical parameters (gender, age, TNM stage), and SDAE features were combined to construct 12 models using SVM, MLP, logistic regression (LR), and random forest (RF). Performance was evaluated via AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, with external validation (91 cases). Results: Model 1 (radiomics + SDAE + clinical features + SVM) achieved the highest AUC (0.89, 95% CI: 0.84-0.93), accuracy (81.5%), sensitivity (67.3%), and specificity (97.9%). External validation showed AUC 0.83, sensitivity 88.9%, and specificity 78%. The DeLong test confirmed no significant AUC difference between internal and external cohorts (P >0.05). Discussion The fusion of SDAE-enhanced features outperformed traditional radiomics. SVM demonstrated optimal performance in small samples, likely due to its high-dimensional feature handling and anti-overfitting capability. Limitations include single-center retrospective design and lack of functional imaging (DWI/PET) or molecular markers (EBV-DNA). Future multicenter prospective studies and multimodal data integration are warranted to enhance biological interpretability and clinical utility. Conclusion: This model provides a tool for early recurrence risk stratification and personalized therapy optimization, advancing precision medicine in NPC management.

AB  - Problem definition: Achieving broad access to health services (a target within the sustainable development goals) requires reaching rural populations. Mobile healthcare units (MHUs) visit remote sites to offer health services to these populations. However, limited exposure, health literacy, and trust can lead to sigmoidal (S-shaped) adoption dynamics, presenting a difficult obstacle in allocating limited MHU resources. It is tempting to allocate resources in line with current demand, as seen in practice. However, to maximize access in the long term, this may be far from optimal, and insights into allocation decisions are limited. Academic/practical relevance: We present a formal model of the long-term allocation of MHU resources as the optimization of a sum of sigmoidal functions. We develop insights into optimal allocation decisions and propose pragmatic methods for estimating our model's parameters from data available in practice. We demonstrate the potential of our approach by applying our methods to family planning MHUs in Uganda. Methodology: Nonlinear optimization of sigmoidal functions and machine learning, especially gradient boosting, are used. Results: Although the problem is NP-hard, we provide closed form solutions to particular cases of the model that elucidate insights into the optimal allocation. Operationalizable heuristic allocations, grounded in these insights, outperform allocations based on current demand. Our estimation approach, designed for interpretability, achieves better predictions than standard methods in the application. Managerial implications: Incorporating the future evolution of demand, driven by community interaction and saturation effects, is key to maximizing access with limited resources. Instead of proportionally assigning more visits to sites with high current demand, a group of sites should be prioritized. Optimal allocation among prioritized sites aims at equalizing demand at the end of the planning horizon. Therefore, more visits should generally be allocated to sites where the cumulative demand potential is higher and counterintuitively, often those where demand is currently lower.

AB  - Background: Controlling the COVID-19 outbreak in Brazil is a challenge due to the population's size and urban density, inefficient maintenance of social distancing and testing strategies, and limited availability of testing resources.
   Objective: The purpose of this study is to effectively prioritize patients who are symptomatic for testing to assist early COVID-19 detection in Brazil, addressing problems related to inefficient testing and control strategies.
   Methods: Raw data from 55,676 Brazilians were preprocessed, and the chi-square test was used to confirm the relevance of the following features: gender, health professional, fever, sore throat, dyspnea, olfactory disorders, cough, coryza, taste disorders, and headache. Classification models were implemented relying on preprocessed data sets; supervised learning; and the algorithms multilayer perceptron (MLP), gradient boosting machine (GBM), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and logistic regression (LR). The models' performances were analyzed using 10-fold cross-validation, classification metrics, and the Friedman and Nemenyi statistical tests. The permutation feature importance method was applied for ranking the features used by the classification models with the highest performances.
   Results: Gender, fever, and dyspnea were among the highest-ranked features used by the classification models. The comparative analysis presents MLP, GBM, DT, RF, XGBoost, and SVM as the highest performance models with similar results. KNN and LR were outperformed by the other algorithms. Applying the easy interpretability as an additional comparison criterion, the DT was considered the most suitable model.
   Conclusions: The DT classification model can effectively (with a mean accuracy >= 89.12%) assist COVID-19 test prioritization in Brazil. The model can be applied to recommend the prioritizing of a patient who is symptomatic for COVID-19 testing.

KW  - STATISTICS & RESEARCH METHODS
AB  - Introduction Large language model (LLM)-linked chatbots are being increasingly applied in healthcare due to their impressive functionality and public availability. Studies have assessed the ability of LLM-linked chatbots to provide accurate clinical advice. However, the methods applied in these Chatbot Assessment Studies are inconsistent due to the lack of reporting standards available, which obscures the interpretation of their study findings. This protocol outlines the development of the Chatbot Assessment Reporting Tool (CHART) reporting guideline. Methods and analysis The development of the CHART reporting guideline will consist of three phases, led by the Steering Committee. During phase one, the team will identify relevant reporting guidelines with artificial intelligence extensions that are published or in development by searching preprint servers, protocol databases, and the Enhancing the Quality and Transparency of health research Network. During phase two, we will conduct a scoping review to identify studies that have addressed the performance of LLM-linked chatbots in summarising evidence and providing clinical advice. The Steering Committee will identify methodology used in previous Chatbot Assessment Studies. Finally, the study team will use checklist items from prior reporting guidelines and findings from the scoping review to develop a draft reporting checklist. We will then perform a Delphi consensus and host two synchronous consensus meetings with an international, multidisciplinary group of stakeholders to refine reporting checklist items and develop a flow diagram. Ethics and dissemination We will publish the final CHART reporting guideline in peer-reviewed journals and will present findings at peer-reviewed meetings. Ethical approval was submitted to the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board and deemed "not required" in accordance with the Tri-Council Policy Statement (TCPS2) for the development of the CHART reporting guideline (#17025).

AB  - Background/Objectives: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) impacts more than 200 million individuals globally and leads to mortality and morbidity secondary to progressive limb dysfunction and amputation. However, clinical management of PAD remains suboptimal, in part because of the lack of standardized biomarkers to predict patient outcomes. Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) is a stress-responsive cytokine that has been studied extensively in cardiovascular disease, but its investigation in PAD remains limited. This study aimed to use explainable statistical and machine learning methods to assess the prognostic value of GDF15 for limb outcomes in patients with PAD. Methods: This prognostic investigation was carried out using a prospectively enrolled cohort comprising 454 patients diagnosed with PAD. At baseline, plasma GDF15 levels were measured using a validated multiplex immunoassay. Participants were monitored over a two-year period to assess the occurrence of major adverse limb events (MALE), a composite outcome encompassing major lower extremity amputation, need for open/endovascular revascularization, or acute limb ischemia. An Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model was trained to predict 2-year MALE using 10-fold cross-validation, incorporating GDF15 levels along with baseline variables. Model performance was primarily evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Secondary model evaluation metrics were accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (PPV). Prediction histogram plots were generated to assess the ability of the model to discriminate between patients who develop vs. do not develop 2-year MALE. For model interpretability, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis was performed to evaluate the relative contribution of each predictor to model outputs. Results: The mean age of the cohort was 71 (SD 10) years, with 31% (n = 139) being female. Over the two-year follow-up period, 157 patients (34.6%) experienced MALE. The XGBoost model incorporating plasma GDF15 levels and demographic/clinical features achieved excellent performance for predicting 2-year MALE in PAD patients: AUROC 0.84, accuracy 83.5%, sensitivity 83.6%, specificity 83.7%, PPV 87.3%, and NPV 86.2%. The prediction probability histogram for the XGBoost model demonstrated clear separation for patients who developed vs. did not develop 2-year MALE, indicating strong discrimination ability. SHAP analysis showed that GDF15 was the strongest predictive feature for 2-year MALE, followed by age, smoking status, and other cardiovascular comorbidities, highlighting its clinical relevance. Conclusions: Using explainable statistical and machine learning methods, we demonstrated that plasma GDF15 levels have important prognostic value for 2-year MALE in patients with PAD. By integrating clinical variables with GDF15 levels, our machine learning model can support early identification of PAD patients at elevated risk for adverse limb events, facilitating timely referral to vascular specialists and aiding in decisions regarding the aggressiveness of medical/surgical treatment. This precision medicine approach based on a biomarker-guided prognostication algorithm offers a promising strategy for improving limb outcomes in individuals with PAD.

AB  - Background As the use of AI becomes more pervasive, and computerised systems are used in clinical decision-making, the role of trust in, and the trustworthiness of, AI tools will need to be addressed. Using the case of computational phenotyping to support the diagnosis of rare disease in dysmorphology, this paper explores under what conditions we could place trust in medical AI tools, which employ machine learning. Methods Semi-structured qualitative interviews (n = 20) with stakeholders (clinical geneticists, data scientists, bioinformaticians, industry and patient support group spokespersons) who design and/or work with computational phenotyping (CP) systems. The method of constant comparison was used to analyse the interview data. Results Interviewees emphasized the importance of establishing trust in the use of CP technology in identifying rare diseases. Trust was formulated in two interrelated ways in these data. First, interviewees talked about the importance of using CP tools within the context of a trust relationship; arguing that patients will need to trust clinicians who use AI tools and that clinicians will need to trust AI developers, if they are to adopt this technology. Second, they described a need to establish trust in the technology itself, or in the knowledge it provides-epistemic trust. Interviewees suggested CP tools used for the diagnosis of rare diseases might be perceived as more trustworthy if the user is able to vouchsafe for the technology's reliability and accuracy and the person using/developing them is trusted. Conclusion This study suggests we need to take deliberate and meticulous steps to design reliable or confidence-worthy AI systems for use in healthcare. In addition, we need to devise reliable or confidence-worthy processes that would give rise to reliable systems; these could take the form of RCTs and/or systems of accountability transparency and responsibility that would signify the epistemic trustworthiness of these tools. words 294.

AB  - When using tree-based methods to develop predictive analytics and early warning systems for preventive healthcare, it is important to use an appropriate imputation method to prevent learning the missingness pattern. To demonstrate this, we developed a novel simulation that generated synthetic electronic health record data using a variational autoencoder with a custom loss function, which took into account the high missing rate of electronic health data. We showed that when tree-based methods learn missingness patterns (correlated with adverse events) in electronic health record data, this leads to decreased performance if the system is used in a new setting that has different missingness patterns. Performance is worst in this scenario when the missing rate between those with and without an adverse event is the greatest. We found that randomized and Bayesian regression imputation methods mitigate the issue of learning the missingness pattern for tree-based methods. We used this information to build a novel early warning system for predicting patient deterioration in general wards and telemetry units: PICTURE (Predicting Intensive Care Transfers and other UnfoReseen Events). To develop, tune, and test PICTURE, we used labs and vital signs from electronic health records of adult patients over four years (n = 133,089 encounters). We analyzed primary outcomes of unplanned intensive care unit transfer, emergency vasoactive medication administration, cardiac arrest, and death. We compared PICTURE with existing early warning systems and logistic regression at multiple levels of granularity. When analyzing PICTURE on the testing set using all observations within a hospital encounter (event rate =3.4%), PICTURE had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.83 and an adjusted (event rate = 4%) area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR) of 0.27, while the next best tested method-regularized logistic regression-had an AUROC of 0.80 and an adjusted AUPR of 0.22. To ensure system interpretability, we applied a state-of-the-art prediction explainer that provided a ranked list of features contributing most to the prediction. Though it is currently difficult to compare machine learning-based early warning systems, a rudimentary comparison with published scores demonstrated that PICTURE is on par with state-of-the-art machine learning systems. To facilitate more robust comparisons and development of early warning systems in the future, we have released our variational autoencoder's code and weights so researchers can (a) test their models on data similar to our institution and (b) make their own synthetic datasets.

AB  - This paper examines the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into cancer screening programmes, focusing on the associated equity challenges and resource allocation implications. While AI technologies promise significant benefits-such as improved diagnostic accuracy, shorter waiting times, reduced reliance on radiographers, and overall productivity gains and cost-effectiveness-current interventions disproportionately favour those already engaged in screening. This neglect of non-attenders, who face the worst cancer outcomes, exacerbates existing health disparities and undermines the core objectives of screening programmes.
   Using breast cancer screening as a case study, we argue that AI interventions must not only improve health outcomes and demonstrate cost-effectiveness but also address inequities by prioritising non-attenders. To this end, we advocate for the design and implementation of cost-saving AI interventions. Such interventions could enable reinvestment into strategies specifically aimed at increasing engagement among non-attenders, thereby reducing disparities in cancer outcomes. Decision modelling is presented as a practical method to identify and evaluate these cost-saving interventions. Furthermore, the paper calls for greater transparency in decision-making, urging policymakers to explicitly account for the equity implications and opportunity costs associated with AI investments. Only then will they be able to balance the promise of technological innovation with the ethical imperative to improve health outcomes for all, particularly underserved populations. Methods such as distributional cost-effectiveness analysis are recommended to quantify and address disparities, ensuring more equitable healthcare delivery.

AB  - Brain tumor detection from medical images, especially magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, is a critical task in early diagnosis and treatment planning. Traditional machine learning approaches often rely on centralized data, raising concerns about data privacy, security, and the difficulty of obtaining large annotated datasets. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution for training models across decentralized devices while maintaining data privacy. However, challenges remain in dealing with non-IID (independent and identically distributed) data, which is common in real-world scenarios. In this research, we used a client-server-based federated learning framework for brain tumor detection using MRI images, leveraging VGG19 as the backbone model. To improve clinical relevance and model interpretability, we have included explainability techniques, particularly Grad-CAM. We trained our model across four clients with non-IID data distribution to simulate real-world conditions. For performance evaluation, we used a centralized test dataset, consisting of 20% of the original data, with the test set used collectively for evaluating model performance after completing federated learning rounds. Using a separate test dataset ensures that all models are evaluated on the same data, making comparisons fair. Since the test dataset is not part of the FL training process, it does not violate the privacy-preserving nature of FL. The experimental results demonstrate that the VGG19 model achieves a high test accuracy of 97.18% (FedAVG), 98.24% (FedProx), and 98.45% (Scaffold) than other state-of-the-art models, showcasing the effectiveness of federated learning in handling distributed and non-IID data. Our findings highlight the potential of federated learning to address privacy concerns in medical image analysis while maintaining high performance even in non-IID settings. This approach provides a promising direction for future research in privacy-preserving AI for healthcare applications.

AB  - BACKGROUND Female depression is a prevalent and increasingly recognized mental health issue. Due to cultural and social factors, many female patients still face challenges in diagnosis and treatment, and traditional assessment methods often fail to identify high-risk individuals accurately. This highlights the necessity of developing more precise predictive tools. Utilizing machine learning (ML) algorithms to construct predictive models may overcome the limitations of traditional methods, providing more comprehensive support for women's mental health. AIM To construct an ML-nomogram hybrid model that translates multivariate risk predictors of female depressive symptoms into actionable clinical scoring thresholds, optimizing predictive accuracy and interpretability for healthcare applications. METHODS We analyzed data from 7609 female participants aged 18 to 85 years from the Guangdong Provincial Sleep and Psychosomatic Health Survey. Sixteen variables, including anxiety symptoms, insomnia, chronic diseases, exercise habits, and age, were selected based on prior literature and comprehensively incorporated into ML models to maximize predictive information utilization. Three ML algorithms, extreme gradient boosting, support vector machine, and light gradient boosting machine, were employed to construct predictive models. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the curve (AUC). Feature importance was interpreted using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), with ablation studies validating the impact of the top five SHAP-derived features on predictive performance, and a nomogram was constructed based on these prioritized predictors. Clinical utility was assessed through decision curve analysis. RESULTS The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 6.8% among the sample. The evaluation of predictive models revealed that light gradient boosting machine achieved a top-performing AUC of 0.867, placing it ahead of extreme gradient boosting (AUC = 0.862) and support vector machine (AUC = 0.849). SHAP analysis identified insomnia, anxiety symptoms, age, chronic disease, and exercise as the top five predictors. The nomogram based on these features demonstrated excellent discrimination (AUC = 0.910) and calibration, with significant net benefits in decision curve analysis compared to baseline strategies. The model effectively stratifies depressive symptoms risk, facilitating personalized and quantitative assessments in clinical settings. We also developed an interactive digital version of the nomogram to facilitate its application in clinical practice. CONCLUSION The ML-based model effectively predicts depressive symptoms in women, identifying insomnia, anxiety symptoms, age, chronic diseases, and exercise as key predictors, offering a practical tool for early detection and intervention.

AB  - Current diagnostics are insufficient for diagnosis and prognosis of acute infections and sepsis. Clinical decisions including prescription and timing of antibiotics, ordering of additional diagnostics and level-of-care decisions rely on understanding etiology and implications of a clinical presentation. Host mRNA signatures can differentiate infectious from noninfectious etiologies, bacterial from viral infections, and predict 30-day mortality. The 29-host-mRNA blood-based InSep (TM) test (Inflammatix, Burlingame, CA, formerly known as HostDx (TM) Sepsis) combines machine learning algorithms with a rapid point-of-care platform with less than 30 min turnaround time to enable rapid diagnosis of acute infections and sepsis, as well as prediction of disease severity. A scientific advisory panel including emergency medicine, infectious disease, intensive care and clinical pathology physicians discussed technical and clinical requirements in preparation of successful introduction of InSep into the market. Topics included intended use; patient populations of greatest need; patient journey and sample flow in the emergency department (ED) and beyond; clinical and biomarker-based decision algorithms; performance characteristics for clinical utility; assay and instrument requirements; and result readouts. The panel identified clear demand for a solution like InSep, requirements regarding test performance and interpretability, and a need for focused medical education due to the innovative but complex nature of the result readout. Innovative diagnostic solutions such as the InSep test could improve management of patients with suspected acute infections and sepsis in the ED, thereby lessening the overall burden of these conditions on patients and the healthcare system.

AB  - In this research, we introduce two new machine learning regression methods: the Ensemble Average and the Pipelined Model. These methods aim to enhance traditional regression analysis for predictive tasks and have undergone thorough evaluation across three datasets, Kaggle House Price, Boston House Price, and California Housing, using various performance metrics. The results consistently show that our models outperform existing methods in terms of accuracy and reliability across all three datasets. The Pipelined Model, in particular, is notable for its ability to combine predictions from multiple models, leading to higher accuracy and impressive scalability. This scalability allows for their application in diverse fields like technology, finance, and healthcare. Furthermore, these models can be adapted for real-time and streaming data analysis, making them valuable for applications such as fraud detection, stock market prediction, and IoT sensor data analysis. Enhancements to the models also make them suitable for big data applications, ensuring their relevance for large datasets and distributed computing environments. It is important to acknowledge some limitations of ourmodels, including potential data biases, specific assumptions, increased complexity, and challenges related to interpretability when using them in practical scenarios. Nevertheless, these innovations advance predictive modeling, and our comprehensive evaluation underscores their potential to provide increased accuracy and reliability across a wide range of applications. The results indicate that the proposed models outperform existing models in terms of accuracy and robustness for all three datasets.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Laboratory tests conducted in community settings are occasionally repeated within hours of presentation to pediatric emergency departments (PEDs). Reducing unnecessary repetitions can ease child discomfort and alleviate the healthcare burden without compromising the diagnostic process or quality of care. The aim of this study was to develop a decision tree (DT) model to guide physicians in minimizing unnecessary repeat blood tests in PEDs. The minimal decision tree (MDT) algorithm was selected for its interpretability and capacity to generate optimally pruned classification trees. Methods: Children aged 3 months to 18 years with community-based complete blood count (CBC), electrolyte (ELE), and C-reactive protein (CRP) measurements obtained between 2016 and 2023 were included. Repeat tests performed in the pediatric emergency department within 12 h were evaluated by comparing paired measurements, with tests considered justified when values transitioned from normal to abnormal ranges or changed by >= 20%. Additionally, sensitivity analyses were conducted for absolute change thresholds of 10% and 30% and for repeat intervals of 6, 18, and 24 h. Results: Among 7813 children visits in this study, 6044, 1941, and 2771 underwent repeated CBC, ELE, and CRP tests, respectively. The mean ages of patients undergoing CRP, ELE, and CBC testing were 6.33 +/- 5.38, 7.91 +/- 5.71, and 5.08 +/- 5.28 years, respectively. The majority were of middle socio-economic class, with 66.61-71.24% living in urban areas. Pain was the predominant presented complaint (83.69-85.99%), and in most cases (83.69-85.99%), the examination was conducted by a pediatrician. The DT model was developed and evaluated on training and validation cohorts, and it demonstrated high accuracy in predicting the need for repeat CBC and ELE tests but not CRP. Performance of the DT model significantly exceeded that of the logistic regression model. Conclusions: The data-driven guide derived from the DT model provides clinicians with a practical, interpretable tool to minimize unnecessary repeat laboratory testing, thereby enhancing patient care and optimizing healthcare resource utilization.

AB  - Optimal stopping is the problem of deciding when to stop a stochastic system to obtain the greatest reward, arising in numerous application areas such as finance, healthcare, and marketing. State-of-the-art methods for high-dimensional optimal stopping involve approximating the value function or the continuation value and then using that approximation within a greedy policy. Although such policies can perform very well, they are generally not guaranteed to be interpretable; that is, a decision maker may not be able to easily see the link between the current system state and the policy's action. In this paper, we propose a new approach to optimal stopping wherein the policy is represented as a binary tree, in the spirit of naturally interpretable tree models commonly used in machine learning. We show that the class of tree policies is rich enough to approximate the optimal policy. We formulate the problem of learning such policies from observed trajectories of the stochastic system as a sample average approximation (SAA) problem. We prove that the SAA problem converges under mild conditions as the sample size increases but that, computationally, even immediate simplifications of the SAA problem are theoretically intractable. We thus propose a tractable heuristic for approximately solving the SAA problem by greedily constructing the tree from the top down. We demonstrate the value of our approach by applying it to the canonical problem of option pricing, using both synthetic instances and instances using real Standard & Pool's 500 Index data. Our method obtains policies that (1) outperform state-of-the-art noninterpretable methods, based on simulation regression and martingale duality, and (2) possess a remarkably simple and intuitive structure.

AB  - Delivering health care at home emerged as a key advancement to reduce healthcare costs and infection risks, as during the SARS-Cov2 pandemic. In particular, in motor training applications, wearable and portable devices can be employed for movement recognition and monitoring of the associated brain signals. This is one of the contexts where it is essential to minimize the monitoring setup and the amount of data to collect, process, and share. In this paper, we address this challenge for a monitoring system that includes high-dimensional EEG and EMG data for the classification of a specific type of hand movement. We fuse EEG and EMG into the magnitude squared coherence (MSC) signal, from which we extracted features using different algorithms (one from the authors) to solve binary classification problems. Finally, we propose a mapping-and-aggregation strategy to increase the interpretability of the machine learning results. The proposed approach provides very low mis-classification errors (< 0.1), with very few and stable MSC features (< 1 0% of the initial set of available features). Furthermore, we identified a common pattern across algorithms and classification problems, i.e., the activation of the centro-parietal brain areas and arm's muscles in 8-80 Hz frequency band, in line with previous literature. Thus, this study represents a step forward to the minimization of a reliable EEG-EMG setup to enable gesture recognition.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) remains a significant health epidemic despite surgical advancements and a global shortage of nephrologists. Medical data analysis and clinical examination can assist healthcare professionals in identifying CKD in its early stages. Computer-based techniques can enhance diagnostic efficiency and accuracy in medical imaging, but current deep-learning-based models have limitations in extracting global information and multi-label classification. The cutting-edge variants of the Vision transformers (ViT) models show promise in capturing information from multiple image regions but require large-scale dataset training. The study proposes a novel approach based on the Swin-ViT model and various modified DL-based pre-trained models (ConvNext, Swint-Unet, MedT, mResNet152V2, EfficientNet-B7, and mVGG19) for prognosis-assisted kidney image and multilabel grading, with changes made to the final layers using the transfer learning paradigm to improve performance and reduce dependence on data scales. Transfer learning can improve classification performance and model generalization in small-scale datasets while reducing training costs. Data enhancement and batch size cutting can improve performance, but smaller batches lead to longer training times. The experiment evaluates the Swin-ViT model for multi-label classification of CKD images via transfer learning, demonstrating that it has a stronger multi-label classification performance and that its attention mechanism is beneficial for precision-focused lesions. The study also generates attention mechanism GradCAM based on the Swin-ViT model, improving interpretability. Ablation experiments demonstrate that incorporating CNN and Transformer models outperform single-structure models. Future research can focus on extracting complex diseases and high-level semantic data to boost the model's ability.

AB  - Disease pathogenesis, a type of domain knowledge about biological mechanisms leading to diseases, has not been adequately encoded in machine-learning-based medical diagnostic models because of the inter-patient variabilities and complex dependencies of the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms. We propose 1) a novel pathogenesis probabilistic graphical model (PPGM) to quantify the dynamics underpinning patient-specific data and pathogenetic domain knowledge, 2) a Bayesian-based inference paradigm to answer the medical queries and forecast acute onsets. The PPGM model consists of two components: a Bayesian network of patient attributes and a temporal model of pathogenetic mechanisms. The model structure was reconstructed from expert knowledge elicitation, and its parameters were estimated using Variational Expectation-Maximization algorithms. We benchmarked our model with two well-established hidden Markov models (HMMs) - Input-output HMM (IOHMM) and Switching Auto-Regressive HMM (SAR-HMM) - to evaluate the computational costs, forecasting performance, and execution time. Two case studies on Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) and Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (PAF) were used to validate the model. While the performance of the parameter learning step was equivalent to those of IO-HMM and SAR-HMM models, our model forecasting ability was outperforming those two models. The merits of the PPGM model are its representation capability to capture the dynamics of pathogenesis and perform medical inferences and its interpretability for physicians. The model has been used to perform medical queries and forecast the acute onset of OSA and PAF. Additional applications of the model include prognostic healthcare and preventive personalized treatments.

AB  - The detection and classification of blood cells from microscopic images plays a vital role in medical diagnosis. However, it is challenging because of the small size, varying shape and dense clustering of cells. Conventional methods rely on manual inspection, which is labor-intensive and depends on expert knowledge. In contrast, Deep Learning (DL) based approaches significantly speed up the process and provide more reliable and consistent results. However, there should be a trade-off between computational costs, model size and accuracy. In this work, we propose the Blood Cell You Only Look Once (BC-YOLO) model built on the YOLOv11 architecture. The backbone of the model is enhanced by replacing traditional convolution structures with MBConv-ECA blocks, resulting in lighter and more efficient feature extraction. This modification reduces computational complexity while increasing accuracy, resulting in a more robust object detection model. The proposed model accurately detects red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells (WBC) and platelets, automating the analysis of microscopic images. Experimental results show that the BC-YOLO Medium model achieves 95.89% mAP@0.5, 92.2% precision and 96.3% recall with 18.5 million parameters and 57.4 GFLOP. The model outperforms not only YOLOv11 but also other YOLO variants and existing studies in the literature. Furthermore, a user-friendly interface has been developed so that end-users can easily upload and analyze microscopic blood cell images as well as inspect the detected cells. In addition, Grad-CAM-based explainability visualizations are also presented to better understand the model's decision-making processes and increase transparency for medical professionals.

AB  - This paper presents a novel method for reconstructing a highly accurate 3D nose model of the human from 2D images and pre-marked landmarks based on algorithmic methods. The study focuses on the reconstruction of a 3D nose model tailored for applications in healthcare and cosmetic surgery. The approach leverages advanced image processing techniques, 3D Morphable Models (3DMM), and deformation techniques to overcome the limitations of deep learning models, particularly addressing the interpretability issues commonly encountered in medical applications. The proposed method estimates the 3D coordinates of landmark points using a 3D structure estimation algorithm. Sub-landmarks are extracted through image processing techniques and interpolation. The initial surface is generated using a 3DMM, though its accuracy remains limited. To enhance precision, deformation techniques are applied, utilizing the coordinates of 76 identified landmarks and sub-landmarks. The resulting 3D nose model is constructed based on algorithmic methods and pre-marked landmarks. Evaluation of the 3D model is conducted by comparing landmark distances and shape similarity with expert-determined ground truth on 30 Vietnamese volunteers aged 18 to 47, all of whom were either preparing for or required nasal surgery. Experimental results demonstrate a strong agreement between the reconstructed 3D model and the ground truth. The method achieved a mean landmark distance error of 0.631 mm and a shape error of 1.738 mm, demonstrating its potential for medical applications.

AB  - Recent advancements in computational and database technologies have led to the exponential growth of large-scale medical datasets, significantly increasing data complexity and dimensionality in medical diagnostics. Efficient feature selection methods are critical for improving diagnostic accuracy, reducing computational costs, and enhancing the interpretability of predictive models. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), a widely used metaheuristic inspired by swarm intelligence, has shown considerable promise in feature selection tasks. However, conventional PSO often suffers from premature convergence and limited exploration capabilities, particularly in high-dimensional spaces. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes an enhanced PSO framework incorporating Orthogonal Initialization and a Crossover Operator (OrPSOC). Orthogonal Initialization ensures a diverse and uniformly distributed initial particle population, substantially improving the algorithm's exploration capability. The Crossover Operator, inspired by genetic algorithms, introduces additional diversity during the search process, effectively mitigating premature convergence and enhancing global search performance. The effectiveness of OrPSOC was rigorously evaluated on three benchmark medical datasets-Colon, Leukemia, and Prostate Tumor. Comparative analyses were conducted against traditional filter-based methods, including Fast Clustering-Based Feature Selection Technique (Fast-C), Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (MinRedMaxRel), and Five-Way Joint Mutual Information (FJMI), as well as prominent metaheuristic algorithms such as standard PSO, Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Comprehensive Learning Gravitational Search Algorithm (CLGSA), and Fuzzy-Based CLGSA (FCLGSA). Experimental results demonstrated that OrPSOC consistently outperformed these existing methods in terms of classification accuracy, computational efficiency, and result stability, achieving significant improvements even with fewer selected features. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis of the crossover parameter provided valuable insights into parameter tuning and its impact on model performance. These findings highlight the superiority and robustness of the proposed OrPSOC approach for feature selection in medical diagnostic applications and underscore its potential for broader adoption in various high-dimensional, data-driven fields.

AB  - Background Early identification and prediction of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) are vital for patient management in lung cancer (LC) surgery. However, existing predictive models often lack comprehensive validation and interpretability. This study aimed to develop and validate an explainable machine learning (ML) model to predict PPCs in patients with LC undergoing surgery. Methods A risk factor variable pool was determined by meta-analysis and Delphi surveys. Patients undergoing LC surgery who were admitted to the Thoracic Surgery Department at the Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University from 1st January 2022 to 31st October 2023 (retrospective) and from 1st November 2023 to 31st July 2024 (prospective) were used for model development and prospective validation, respectively. The retrospective cohort was randomly split into a training set and an internal validation set at an 8:2 ratio. Feature selection involved univariate analysis, collinearity analysis, nine ML algorithms, and expert consensus. Twelve independent ML models and 26 stacking ensemble models were developed. Predictive performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUROC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and F1 score. Prospective validation was analysed using AUC, Hosmer-Lemeshow test, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA). The Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) method was utilised to interpret the predictive model. Findings A total of 883 patients were included in the retrospective cohort with an incidence of PPCs of 35.4% (313/ 883), and a total of 308 patients were included in the prospective cohort with PPCs of 29.5% (91/308). Nine key characteristics were selected for model development: age, duration of surgery, Charson comorbidity index (CCI), tumour stage, measured carbon monoxide diffusion (DLCO, mmol/min/kPa), intra-operative infusion volume (IFIV, mL), red blood cell volume distribution width-coefficient of variation (RDW-CV, %), body mass index (BMI), and number of years of smoking. Amongst the independent models, the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) showed best performance, achieving an AUROC of 0.829 (95% CI: 0.774-0.885). The stacking ensemble combining Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree (DT) showed the highest overall performance, with an AUROC of 0.860 (95% CI: 0.809-0.911), and DCA showed higher clinical utility compared to other models. In the prospective validation, the AUROC was 0.790 (95% CI: 0.744-0.835). Interpretation The stacking ensemble model combining SVM and DT demonstrated robust predictive performance and favourable clinical utility for prediction PPCs in patients undergoing LC surgery. However, the model has not been applied in clinical practice and requires future validation in large, multi-centre cohorts. Further work should aim to identify high-risk patients early through clinical data analysis, enabling timely interventions and more efficient allocation of limited healthcare resources.

AB  - Gastrointestinal (GI) diseases present a significant healthcare challenge, requiring the development of accurate and efficient diagnostic methods. Traditional diagnostic methods often use single models, which have difficulty capturing the complex and varied patterns of these conditions. To address this limitation, we propose a groundbreaking ensemble method specifically designed for the detection of GI. Our approach strategically selects three robust base models-EfficientNetB0, EfficientNetB2, and ResNet101-leveraging transfer learning to utilize their pre-trained weights and feature representations. This foundation accelerates training and enhanced the models' capacity to discern complex patterns associated with gastrointestinal conditions. Our methodology is centered around a novel beta normalization aggregation scheme that combines insights from individual models according to their confidence scores. This refined aggregation approach culminates in a nuanced ensemble model that improves overall predictive accuracy. We rigorously evaluate our proposed method on two established gastrointestinal datasets-one comprising four classes and the other three classes-achieving exceptional accuracies of 97.88% and 97.47%, respectively. Notably, our approach not only outperforms the individual base models but also surpasses existing methodologies in gastrointestinal diagnosis. Using Grad-CAM analysis, we present visualizations of the decision-making processes in our models, which enhanced both interpretability and trustworthiness. Unlike conventional ensemble methods that utilize basic summation or other traditional strategies, our innovative weighted average strategy and improved beta normalization scheme position our ensemble method as a powerful and reliable tool for accurate gastrointestinal disease detection. This advancement holds the potential to significantly enhance diagnostic precision in the complex landscape of gastrointestinal health, offering new avenues for clinical application and improved patient outcomes.

AB  - Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals obtained from the skin's surface offer valuable insights into blood volume fluctuations. With the rising interest in continuous non-invasive physiological monitoring, PPG has garnered significant attention. However, PPG signals are often affected by various forms of noise, impeding reliable feature extraction. Robust data pre-processing approaches are vital for both retrospective and real-time analysis. Existing denoising methods, including recent machine learning techniques, often suffer from implementation challenges, computational inefficiency, and limited interpretability. Addressing this challenge, we propose a novel PPG denoising algorithm. The algorithm was evaluated using a dataset representing approximately 81,015.99 min or 1360.27 h of PPG data collected from 31 patients. The evaluation involved the calculation and analysis of five key metrics: Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), Variance, Total Variation (TV), Shannon entropy, and Instances-per-second (IPS). Our results demonstrate a notable increase in SNR after denoising, indicating effective noise reduction while preserving signal content. Variance and TV values showed a reduction post-denoising, suggesting smoother and less variable signals, validating the noise suppression efficacy. Additionally, Shannon entropy exhibited a decrease after denoising, indicating successful noise reduction and enhanced signal regularity. The nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test (a = 0.05) was employed to assess the statistical significance of the observed differences of these metrics before and after denoising. Furthermore, the computational speed analysis revealed the EPDA's potential for efficient processing of large datasets and real-time applications. This comprehensive evaluation approach allows for a thorough understanding of the EPDA's effectiveness in denoising PPG data, fostering advancements in non-invasive physiological monitoring and promoting the broader adoption of PPG-based healthcare technologies.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to provide the development of a method to classify optical coherence tomography (OCT)-assessed retinal data in the context of automatic diagnosis of early-stage multiple sclerosis (MS) with decision explanation. Methods: The database used contains recordings from 79 patients with recently diagnosed relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and no history of optic neuritis and from 69 age-matched healthy control subjects. Analysis was performed on the thicknesses (average right and left eye value and inter-eye difference) of the macular retinal nerve fiber layer (mRNFL), macular ganglion cell layer (mGCL), macular inner plexiform layer (mIPL), and macular inner retinal complex layer (mIRL), dividing the macular area into six analysis zones. Recursive feature extraction (RFE) and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) are combined to rank relevant features and select the subset that maximizes classifier (support vector machine [SVM]) performance. Results: Of the initial 48 features, 20 were identified as maximizing classifier accuracy (n = 0.9257). The SHAP values indicate that average thickness has greater relevance than inter-eye difference, that the mGCL and mRNFL are the most influential structures, and that the peripheral papillomacular bundle and the supero-temporal quadrant are the zones most affected. Conclusions: This approach improves the success rate of automatic diagnosis of early- stage RRMS and enhances clinical decision making transparency. Translational Relevance: Retinal structure assessment using OCT data could constitute a noninvasive means of diagnosing early-stage MS. This new high-accuracy and highexplainability method of analysis can be implemented in most hospitals and healthcare centers.

This study combined parental-reported and register-based dispensed medication data to characterize childhood trajectories of co-existing asthma, allergic rhinitis, and eczema.MethodsFrom a Swedish population-based birth cohort (N = 5654), survey responses collected at the age of 1, 4.5, 8, and 12 years were linked to dispensed medication register data for the period of 2-13 years. Trajectories were identified with latent class analysis. Statistical metrics and clinical interpretability guided the model selection.ResultsNine distinct trajectories were identified: three asthma-dominated (early-onset remitting [n = 189, 3.3%], late-onset [n = 117, 2.1%], and persistent [n = 149, 2.6%]), two eczema-dominated (persistent [n = 190, 3.4%] and remitting [n = 432, 7.6%]), one allergic rhinitis-dominated (late-onset [n = 259, 4.6%]), two multimorbidity (mid-childhood asthma and late-onset allergic rhinitis [n = 144, 2.5%], and persistent eczema and late-onset allergic rhinitis [n = 90, 1.6%]), and one low-disease burden trajectory (n = 4084, 72.2%). Differences were seen across the trajectories in the proportion of parental report of disease and dispensed medication as well as by class and quantity of medication dispensed.ConclusionCombined parental-reported and dispensed medication data enriches characterization of longitudinal trajectories of asthma and allergy in children by merging subjective experience of disease with healthcare utilization. The identified trajectories were characterized by distinct disease development and prescription patterns suggesting clinically differential morbidity burden.

AB  - Heart failure (HF) is a life-threatening disease affecting at least 64 million people worldwide. Hence, it places great stresses on patients and healthcare systems. Accordingly, providing a computerized model for HF prediction will help in enhancing diagnosis, treatment, and long-term management of HF. In this paper, we introduce a new guided attentive HF prediction approach. In this method, a sparse-guided feature ranking method is proposed. Firstly, a Gauss-Seidel strategy is applied to the preprocessed feature pool for low-rank approximation procedure with a trace-norm regularization. The resultant sparse attributes, after a Spearman ranking elimination, are employed to guide the original feature pool through linear translation-variant model. Then, a fast Newton-based method is employed for a non-negative matrix factorization for the guided feature pool. The resultant bases of the factorization process are finally utilized in the adopted deep attentive predictive model. For the final prediction stage, instead of the commonly used machine learning approaches, we introduce an attentive-based classifier. It employs sequential attention to choose the most proper salient features for efficient interpretability and learning process. For the evaluation of the proposed HF prediction model, three different datasets are employed, i.e., UCI, Faisalabad, and Framingham datasets. Compared to state-of-the-art techniques, the proposed approach outperforms their performance on all datasets with even small feature sizes. With only four feature bases, the proposed method achieves an average accuracy of 98%, while, with full feature bases, full accuracy is gained.

AB  - The rapid advancement of the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and human-machine interfaces requires advanced, user-friendly input technologies. Conventional touch-sensing systems with rigid electrodes and external power sources compromise user experience. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) address these limitations by generating electricity from mechanical stimuli without external power. However, achieving high performance with stretchability remains challenging. Among various stretchable materials, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) gels are especially suitable for TENGs because of their adjustable electrical and mechanical properties by merely changing the type and content of plasticizers. This study investigates the influence of plasticizer structures with different numbers of aliphatic carbonyl groups (butyl benzoate (BB), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), and tributyl trimellitate (TBT)) on PVC gel-based TENGs and optimizes them for triboresistive position sensors (TPSs). All PVC gels exhibit high transparency (>90% transmittance) and exceptional stretchability (>1714% strain). Decreasing the number of aliphatic carbonyl groups in the plasticizer improved gel deformation, dielectric constants, and triboelectric negativity. In particular, the maximum power density of the double-electrode mode TENG with BB-plasticized PVC gel (4.986 W/m(2)) is 2.1 and 3.7 times that of the DBP- and TBT-plasticized PVC gel-based TENGs, respectively. Additionally, the single-layer mode TENG based on the BB-plasticized PVC gel demonstrates a maximum power density of 387 mW/m(2) and powers 45 green LEDs with hand tapping. The TPS based on BB-plasticized PVC gel maintains stable sensing capabilities even under 50% strain. These findings highlight the potential of PVC gel-based devices in next-generation electronics including wearable devices, human-machine interfaces, soft robotics, and healthcare monitoring.

AB  - The rapid proliferation of AI-powered avatars in the Metaverse is fundamentally transforming user interactions through unprecedented levels of realism and personalization. However, these advances also introduce critical ethical and legal dilemmas surrounding privacy, identity theft, algorithmic bias, and data governance. This study employs a comprehensive multimethodological approach combining systematic literature review, regulatory gap analysis, and ethical framework synthesis. Our methodology integrates qualitative analysis of primary sources, comparative assessment of international legal frameworks (GDPR, CCPA, EU,AI Act), and development of a five pillar ethical framework validated through real-world case studies across educational, commercial, and healthcare Metaverse applications. Building on these insights, we propose an ethical framework emphasizing transparency, fairness, accountability, privacy by design, and user autonomy. We then examine practical solutions such as blockchain-based identity management, privacy tools, regulatory sandboxes, and global standards harmonization. Through computational simulation of representative Metaverse environments, we explore how stakeholders can apply these guidelines to balance innovation with user protection. Finally, we explore future directions, including integrating brain computer interfaces (BCIs), emotion detection, quantum-resistant cryptography, and international governance models. Validation through case study analysis demonstrates significant improvements in privacy protection metrics, substantial reduction in identity theft vulnerabilities, and marked enhancement in user autonomy controls compared to existing frameworks. Our proposed blockchain-based identity management shows effective prevention of deepfake avatar creation while maintaining high user experience satisfactio. By proactively embracing ethical and legal safeguards, we envision a Metaverse where AI-driven avatars deliver transformative experiences while upholding individual rights and societal well-being.

AB  - Objectives This qualitative study explored public and prescriber awareness of pharmaceutical pollution in the water environment and eco-directed sustainable prescribing (EDSP) as a mitigation strategy to reduce the environmental impact of prescribing in Scotland.Design Focus groups explored prescriber and public perceptions of the topic. Common questions were asked through semistructured facilitation. Focus groups were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim using an artificial intelligence system, then anonymised and thematically analysed using NVivo software. Data were iteratively analysed using the one sheet of paper technique.Setting Public focus groups were held in-person (Inverness, Scotland, April 2023), and prescriber focus groups were held virtually (MS Teams, August 2023).Participants Nine public representatives and 17 NHS Scotland prescribers participated in one of four focus groups. Purposive and opportunistic sampling approaches were used to recruit participants through social media and other channels (ie, community groups, professional emails, general practitioner and hospital flyers). Prescriber representatives registered interest through an online survey to gather information about their professional background. Responses were reviewed to ensure representation of a mixture of medical backgrounds, experience, sectors and health boards.Results There is growing awareness among the public and healthcare professionals of pharmaceutical pollution in the environment, but further education is required on the drivers, potential effects and possible interventions. Suggestions for more sustainable healthcare included public health awareness campaigns, better provision for pharmacy take-back schemes, clear medicine/packaging labelling, regular medicines reviews and more considered patient-centred care. From the prescriber perspective, EDSP resonated well with current sustainability initiatives (eg, Realistic Medicine, switching to dry-powder inhalers), but barriers to EDSP included lack of knowledge, confidence, time and resources to implement changes. Although the public representatives were generally open to the concept of EDSP, this decision required weighing pros/cons considering personal health choices, information accessibility and transparency, and trust in and time with prescribers.Conclusions This study identified new insights from prescribers and the public related to the concept of, and barriers to, EDSP in Scotland, as well as perspectives regarding knowledge support tools and information communication. Cross-sector and transdisciplinary collaborative approaches are needed to address the challenges identified here. Nonetheless, EDSP merits further exploration in developing more sustainable, appropriate and effective healthcare which contributes to improved public and planetary health.

TI  - DFU_DIALNet: Towards reliable and trustworthy diabetic foot ulcer detection with synergistic confluence of Grad-CAM and LIME
T2  - PLOS ONE

KW  - INFECTION
KW  - ISCHEMIA
AB  - Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU) is a major complication of diabetes which needs early detection to help in timely treatment for preventing future serious consequences. Due to peripheral neuropathy, high blood glucose levels, and untreated wounds, DFUs can cause the disintegration of the skin and exposing the tissue below it, if not adequately treated. Recently deep learning (DL) has advanced and has shown its ability to automate DFU detection and classification by analysing medical images. The use of DL has been proven to be very useful for healthcare professionals, enabling earlier diagnosis and effective treatment of DFU. However, most of the studies predominantly rely on a single dataset (e.g., DFUC2021 or DFUC2020) without external validation or cross-dataset testing, raising concerns about generalizability and trustworthiness. The aim of this study is to develop a robust, reliable, and transparent DFU detection framework which is not only good performing but also can effectively give attention to the proper region of the images which are crucial for DFU detection. So, to make DFU detection robust, reliable in a single study, we proposed a custom approach, DFU_DIALNet and to enhance transparency and interpret the model decisions in this study, we integrated Grad-CAM and LIME heatmaps to precisely localize ulcer regions. This allows visual verification of the model's focus and clarifies the decision-making process, thereby increasing the model's reliability. DFU_DIALNet outperforms all other traditional models with 99.33% accuracy, 99% F1 score, and 100% AUC score, and compared it to other DL models-DenseNet121, MobileNetV2, InceptionV3, EfficientNetB0, ResNet50V2 and VGG16-in the merged dataset of DFUC2021 with our collected 500 images. We have checked our model's reliability with 2 other popular datasets--the KDFU and DFUC2020 datasets, where our proposed approach gives the highest accuracy of 95.61% and 99.54%, respectively, compared to other deep learning approaches. Lastly, we have developed a web app using Streamlit to detect DFU efficiently. This study fills the gap between reliable and interpretable systems with a proposed approach to the efficient detection of DFU.

AB  - Background: Kidney stone (KS) disease has high, increasing prevalence in the United States and poses a massive economic burden. Diagnostics algorithms of KS only use a few variables with a limited sensitivity and specificity. In this study, we tested a big data approach to infer and validate a 'multi-domain' personalized diagnostic acute care algorithm for KS (DACA-KS), merging demographic, vital signs, clinical, and laboratory information.
   Methods: We utilized a large, single-center database of patients admitted to acute care units in a large tertiary care hospital. Patients diagnosed with KS were compared to groups of patients with acute abdominal/flank/groin pain, genitourinary diseases, and other conditions. We analyzed multiple information domains (several thousands of variables) using a collection of statistical and machine learning models with feature selectors. We compared sensitivity, specificity and area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of our approach with the STONE score, using cross-validation.
   Results: Thirty eight thousand five hundred and ninety-seven distinct adult patients were admitted to critical care between 2001 and 2012, of which 217 were diagnosed with KS, and 7446 with acute pain (non-KS). The multi-domain approach using logistic regression yielded an AUROC of 0.86 and a sensitivity/specificity of 0.81/0.82 in cross-validation. Increase in performance was obtained by fitting a super-learner, at the price of lower interpretability. We discussed in detail comorbidity and lab marker variables independently associated with KS (e.g. blood chloride, candidiasis, sleep disorders).
   Conclusions: Although external validation is warranted, DACA-KS could be integrated into electronic health systems; the algorithm has the potential used as an effective tool to help nurses and healthcare personnel during triage or clinicians making a diagnosis, streamlining patients' management in acute care.

AB  - AimsMinimally invasive cardiac intervention (MICI) patients remain at high risk of readmission and mortality during their post-discharge phase, with 30-day readmission rates of up to 10%. Although technological innovations, especially AI-driven solutions, hold promise for improving outcomes, there is a pressing need to clarify the full spectrum of patient demands during the transition from hospital to home. This study aimed to systematically identify these demands to guide the development of AI-driven solutions that reduce readmission rates and improve clinical outcomes.Methods and resultsA convergent parallel mixed-methods design was employed to systematically identify patient demands and inform the development of AI-driven interventions in transitional care. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected from 137 MICI patients recruited from four hospitals (June-August 2024). Quantitatively, a 23-item survey was analyzed using the Kano model, revealing no "must-be" demands-indicating that patients were accustomed to a lack of guidance post-discharge. However, health monitoring, medication guidance, symptom management, and personalized exercise plans were identified as "one-dimensional" demands that significantly impact patient satisfaction. Additionally, continuous exercise monitoring and dietary planning emerged as "attractive" features that could enhance care quality without negatively affecting satisfaction if absent. Qualitative interviews uncovered the importance of comorbidity management, psychological support and financial transparency, which were not fully captured in the survey data. The integration of these findings underscores the need for AI-driven personalized health monitoring systems and knowledge-based AI tools to revolutionize the transitional care process for MICI patients.ConclusionThis integrated analysis highlights the significant care demands of MICI patients during the transition from hospital to home. Key recommendations include: (1) deploying AI-driven health monitoring, medication guidance, and symptom management systems, (2) designing personalized exercise and dietary tools, and (3) creating accessible, knowledge-based platforms for reliable medical information. In addition, comorbidity management, psychological support and financial transparency are areas that call for our attention. By aligning with these patient-centered demands and leveraging AI's capabilities, future transitional care interventions-particularly in China have the potential to address healthcare staffing constraints and improve patient outcomes. However, due to the limitations of our study, these insights require further validation and exploration.

AB  - Introduction Multi-sensor fusion has emerged as a transformative approach in AI-driven behavior planning for medical applications, significantly enhancing perception, decision-making, and adaptability in complex and dynamic environments. Traditional fusion methods primarily rely on deterministic techniques such as Kalman Filters or rule-based decision models. While effective in structured settings, these methods often struggle to maintain robustness under sensor degradation, occlusions, and environmental uncertainties. Such limitations pose critical challenges for real-time decision-making in medical applications, where precision, reliability, and adaptability are paramount.Methods To address these challenges, we propose an Adaptive Probabilistic Fusion Network (APFN), a novel framework that dynamically integrates multi-modal sensor data based on estimated sensor reliability and contextual dependencies. Unlike conventional approaches, APFN employs an uncertainty-aware representation using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), effectively capturing confidence levels in fused estimates to enhance robustness against noisy or incomplete data. We incorporate an attention-driven deep fusion mechanism to extract high-level spatial-temporal dependencies, improving interpretability and adaptability. By dynamically weighing sensor inputs and optimizing feature selection, APFN ensures superior decision-making under varying medical conditions.Results We rigorously evaluate our approach on multiple large-scale medical datasets, comprising over one million trajectory samples across four public benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that APFN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 8.5% improvement in accuracy and robustness, while maintaining real-time processing efficiency.Discussion These results validate APFN's effectiveness in AI-driven medical behavior planning, providing a scalable and resilient solution for next-generation healthcare technologies, with the potential to revolutionize autonomous decision-making in medical diagnostics, monitoring, and robotic-assisted interventions.

AB  - ObjectivesEpilepsy is a disorder causing repeated seizures because of unusual brain activity recorded using electroencephalography. Nevertheless, conventional epilepsy seizure detection approaches face difficulties such as poor epilepsy seizure detection accuracy and higher computational complexity. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes a novel TransseizNet framework for epilepsy seizure detection from the electroencephalography signal.MethodsThe electroencephalography data from three datasets are pre-processed using the Savitzky-Golay filter. The proposed framework utilizes the Empirical Tunable Q-Wavelet Transform for signal decomposition, which is the combination of the Empirical Wavelet Transform and the Tunable Q-factor Wavelet Transform. This enhances time-frequency resolution and adaptively captures localized oscillatory patterns critical for precise seizure detection. The proposed framework utilizes a Wavelet-Graph Convolutional Network Vision Transformer for epilepsy seizure detection and classification. The integration of wavelet-driven attention with graph-based learning enhances spatial-temporal feature representation, which makes seizure detection more accurate, interpretable, and computationally efficient than the baseline approaches.ResultsThe TransseizNet model is trained and validated on three datasets and achieves an average accuracy of 98.65% a precision of 98.59%, a F1-score of 98.45%, a recall of 98.30%, a specificity of 98.52%, a computational time of 17 sec, and the detection latency of 2.5 sec, which outperforms the performance of baseline approaches in the detection of epileptic seizures.DiscussionTransseizNet framework provides superior performance in seizure detection by efficiently integrating adaptive frequency decomposition and hybrid deep learning. Its minimal detection latency, higher accuracy, and interpretability make it suitable for practical healthcare uses.

AB  - The analysis of microscopic images of hair has a wide range of applications in the domains of cosmetics, healthcare and forensics. The segmentation of the hair represents the initial step of automatic large-scale quantitative analysis of microscopic images of hair. It ensures that subsequent quantitative measurements are performed in an appropriate area corresponding to the hair, avoiding artifacts near the boundaries. This process can be time-consuming, tedious and susceptible to subjective errors when conducted by a human operator. Deep learning methods represent a promising solution; however, obtaining pixel-level accurate masks is a costly process. This paper presents a novel weakly supervised pipeline for the segmentation of hair SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) microscopic images, which requires only simple image-level annotations for training. The proposed method incorporates the Radon transform, the Sobel operator and a novel Boundary Discrimination Module (BD-module) for the estimation of the presence of boundaries. The proposed pipeline was evaluated on a recently collected hair SEM dataset (429 images). Furthermore, it is benchmarked with methods including Unet and Segment Anything Model (SAM). The results demonstrated a mean Hausdorff Distance improvement of over 30% and a standard deviation improvement of over 50% in comparison with the Unet and SAM. Moreover, we proposed additional refinement modules to address boundary nonlinear cases and conducted Grad-CAM analysis to enhance the interpretability of the BD-module. Additionally, we proposed a novel quality estimation metric based on gradient map for self-quality assessment. The SEM hair dataset is accessible to the research community in an open-source format.

AB  - Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition that impairs motor and non-motor functions. Early and accurate diagnosis is critical for effective management and care. Leveraging machine learning (ML) techniques, this study aimed to develop a robust prediction system for PD using a stacked ensemble learning approach, addressing challenges such as imbalanced datasets and feature optimization. Methods: An open-access PD dataset comprising 22 vocal attributes and 195 instances from 31 subjects was utilized. To prevent data leakage, subjects were divided into training (22 subjects) and testing (9 subjects) groups, ensuring no subject appeared in both sets. Preprocessing included data cleaning and normalization via min-max scaling. The synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) was applied exclusively to the training set to address class imbalance. Feature selection techniques-forward search, gain ratio, and Kruskal-Wallis test-were employed using subject-wise cross-validation to identify significant attributes. The developed system combined support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and decision tree (DT) as base classifiers, with logistic regression (LR) as the meta-classifier in a stacked ensemble learning framework. Performance was evaluated using both recording-wise and subject-wise metrics to ensure clinical relevance. Results: The stacked ensemble learning model achieved realistic performance with a recording-wise accuracy of 84.7% and subject-wise accuracy of 77.8% on completely unseen subjects, outperforming individual classifiers including KNN (81.4%), RF (79.7%), and SVM (76.3%). Cross-validation within the training set showed 89.2% accuracy, with the performance difference highlighting the importance of proper validation methodology. Feature selection results showed that using the top 10 features ranked by gain ratio provided optimal balance between performance and clinical interpretability. The system's methodological robustness was validated through rigorous subject-wise evaluation, demonstrating the critical impact of validation methodology on reported performance. Conclusions: By implementing subject-wise validation and preventing data leakage, this study demonstrates that proper validation yields substantially different (and more realistic) results compared to flawed recording-wise approaches. The findings underscore the critical importance of validation methodology in healthcare ML applications and provide a template for methodologically sound PD classification research. Future research should focus on validating the model with larger, multi-center datasets and implementing standardized validation protocols to enhance clinical applicability.

AB  - Background: The escalating global scarcity of skilled health care professionals is a critical concern, further exacerbated by rising stress levels and clinician burnout rates. Artificial intelligence (AI) has surfaced as a potential resource to alleviate these challenges. Nevertheless, it is not taken for granted that AI will inevitably augment human performance, as ill-designed systems may inadvertently impose new burdens on health care workers, and implementation may be challenging. An in-depth understanding of how AI can effectively enhance rather than impair work conditions is therefore needed. Objective: This research investigates the efficacy of AI in alleviating stress and enriching work conditions, using intensive care units (ICUs) as a case study. Through a sociotechnical system lens, we delineate how AI systems, tasks, and responsibilities of ICU nurses and physicians can be co-designed to foster motivating, resilient, and health-promoting work. Methods: We use the sociotechnicalsystem frameworkCOMPASS (Complementary Analysis ofSociotechnicalSystems)to assess 5job characteristics: autonomy, skill diversity, flexibility, problem-solving opportunities, and task variety. The qualitative analysis is underpinned by extensive workplace observation in 6 ICUs (approximately 559 nurses and physicians), structured interviews with work unit leaders (n=12), and a comparativeanalysis of data scienceexperts' and clinicians' evaluation of the optimal levels of human-AI teaming. Results: The results indicate that AI holds the potential to positively impact work conditions for ICU nurses and physicians in four key areas. First, autonomy is vital for stress reduction, motivation, and performance improvement. AI systems that ensure transparency, predictability, and human control can reinforce or amplify autonomy. Second, AI can encourage skill diversity and competence development, thus empowering clinicians to broaden their skills, increasethe polyvalence of tasks across professional boundaries, and improve interprofessional cooperation. However, careful consideration is required to avoid the deskilling of experienced professionals. Third, AI automation can expand flexibility by relieving clinicians from administrative duties, thereby concentrating their efforts on patient care. Remote monitoring and improved scheduling can help integrate work with other life domains. Fourth, whileAI may reduce problem-solving opportunitiesin certain areas, it can open new pathways, particularly for nurses. Finally, task identity and variety are essential job characteristics for intrinsic motivation and worker engagement but could be compromised depending on how AI tools are designed and implemented. Conclusions:This study demonstrates AI's capacity to mitigate stress and improve work conditions for ICU nurses and physicians, thereby contributing to resolving health care staffing shortages. AI solutions that are thoughtfully designed in line with the principles for good work design can enhance intrinsic motivation, learning, and worker well-being, thus providing strategic value for hospital management, policy makers, and health care professionals alike.

AB  - Background: Cardiac arrest (CA) is one of the leading causes of death among patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Althoughmany CA prediction models with high sensitivity have been developed to anticipate CA, their practical application has beenchallenging due to a lack of generalization and validation. Additionally, the heterogeneity among patients in different ICU subtypeshas not been adequately addressed. Objective: This study aims to propose a clinically interpretable ensemble approach for the timely and accurate prediction ofCA within 24 hours, regardless of patient heterogeneity, including variations across different populations and ICU subtypes.Additionally, we conducted patient-independent evaluations to emphasize the model's generalization performance and analyzedinterpretable results that can be readily adopted by clinicians in real-time. Methods: Patients were retrospectively analyzed using data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV)and the eICU-Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD). To address the problem of underperformance, we constructed ourframework using feature sets based on vital signs, multiresolution statistical analysis, and the Gini index, with a 12-hour windowto capture the unique characteristics of CA. We extracted 3 types of features from each database to compare the performance ofCA prediction between high-risk patient groups from MIMIC-IV and patients without CA from eICU-CRD. After featureextraction, we developed a tabular network (TabNet) model using feature screening with cost-sensitive learning. To assessreal-time CA prediction performance, we used 10-fold leave-one-patient-out cross-validation and a cross-data set method. Weevaluated MIMIC-IV and eICU-CRD across different cohort populations and subtypes of ICU within each database. Finally,external validation using the eICU-CRD and MIMIC-IV databases was conducted to assess the model's generalization ability.The decision mask of the proposed method was used to capture the interpretability of the model. Results: The proposed method outperformed conventional approaches across different cohort populations in both MIMIC-IVand eICU-CRD. Additionally, it achieved higher accuracy than baseline models for various ICU subtypes within both databases.The interpretable prediction results can enhance clinicians'understanding of CA prediction by serving as a statistical comparisonbetween non-CA and CA groups. Next, we tested the eICU-CRD and MIMIC-IV data sets using models trained on MIMIC-IVand eICU-CRD, respectively, to evaluate generalization ability. The results demonstrated superior performance compared withbaseline models. Conclusions: Our novel framework for learning unique features provides stable predictive power across different ICUenvironments. Most of the interpretable global information reveals statistical differences between CA and non-CA groups,demonstrating its utility as an indicator for clinical decisions. Consequently, the proposed CA prediction system is a clinicallyvalidated algorithm that enables clinicians to intervene early based on CA prediction information and can be applied to clinicaltrials in digital health

AB  - Introduction As healthcare is shifting from a paternalistic to a patient-centred approach, medical decision making becomes more collaborative involving patients, their support persons (SPs) and physicians. Implementing shared decision-making (SDM) into clinical practice can be challenging and becomes even more complex with the introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) as a potential actant in the communicative network. Although there is more empirical research on patients' and physicians' perceptions of AI, little is known about the impact of AI on SDM. This study will help to fill this gap. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic empirical investigation to prospectively assess the views of patients, their SPs and physicians on how AI affects SDM in physician-patient communication after kidney transplantation. Using a transdisciplinary approach, this study will explore the role and impact of an AI-decision support system (DSS) designed to assist with medical decision making in the clinical encounter.Methods and analysis This is a plan to roll out a 2 year, longitudinal qualitative interview study in a German kidney transplant centre. Semi-structured interviews with patients, SPs and physicians will be conducted at baseline and in 3-, 6-, 12- and 24-month follow-up. A total of 50 patient-SP dyads and their treating physicians will be recruited at baseline. Assuming a dropout rate of 20% per year, it is anticipated that 30 patient-SP dyads will be included in the last follow-up with the aim of achieving data saturation. Interviews will be audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts will be analysed using framework analysis. Participants will be asked to report on their (a) communication experiences and preferences, (b) views on the influence of the AI-based DSS on the normative foundations of the use of AI in medical decision-making, focusing on agency along with trustworthiness, transparency and responsibility and (c) perceptions of the use of the AI-based DSS, as well as barriers and facilitators to its implementation into routine care.Ethics and dissemination Approval has been granted by the local ethics committee of Charit & eacute;-Universit & auml;tsmedizin Berlin (EA1/177/23 on 08 August 2023). This research will be conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (1996). The study findings will be used to develop communication guidance for physicians on how to introduce and sustainably implement AI-assisted SDM. The study results will also be used to develop lay language patient information on AI-assisted SDM. A broad dissemination strategy will help communicate the results of this research to a variety of target groups, including scientific and non-scientific audiences, to allow for a more informed discourse among different actors from policy, science and society on the role and impact of AI in physician-patient communication.

AB  - Background: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have realized the potential of revolutionizing healthcare, such as predicting disease progression via longitudinal inspection of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and lab tests from patients admitted to Intensive Care Units (ICU). Although substantial literature exists addressing broad subjects, including the prediction of mortality, length -of -stay, and readmission, studies focusing on forecasting Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), specifically dialysis anticipation like Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) are scarce. The technicality of how to implement AI remains elusive. Objective: This study aims to elucidate the important factors and methods that are required to develop effective predictive models of AKI and CRRT for patients admitted to ICU, using EHRs in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) database. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis of established predictive models, considering both time -series measurements and clinical notes from MIMIC -IV databases. Subsequently, we proposed a novel multimodal model which integrates embeddings of top -performing unimodal models, including Long Short -Term Memory (LSTM) and BioMedBERT, and leverages both unstructured clinical notes and structured time series measurements derived from EHRs to enable the early prediction of AKI and CRRT. Results: Our multimodal model achieved a lead time of at least 12 h ahead of clinical manifestation, with an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) of 0.888 for AKI and 0.997 for CRRT, as well as an Area Under the Precision Recall Curve (AUPRC) of 0.727 for AKI and 0.840 for CRRT, respectively, which significantly outperformed the baseline models. Additionally, we performed a SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) analysis using the expected gradients algorithm, which highlighted important, previously underappreciated predictive features for AKI and CRRT. Conclusion: Our study revealed the importance and the technicality of applying longitudinal, multimodal modeling to improve early prediction of AKI and CRRT, offering insights for timely interventions. The performance and interpretability of our model indicate its potential for further assessment towards clinical applications, to ultimately optimize AKI management and enhance patient outcomes.

AB  - Through the use of blockchain technology, sensitive information may be securely communicated without the need to replicate it, which can assist in decreasing medical record mistakes and saving time by eliminating the need to duplicate information. Furthermore, the information is timestamped, which further enhances the security of the data even further. The deployment of blockchain technology in a range of healthcare situations may enhance the security and efficiency of payment transactions. In this way, only those who have been allowed access to patient medical information can see or modify such information. It is proposed in this study that blockchain technology be used to provide an accessible data storage and retrieval mechanism for patients and healthcare professionals in a healthcare system that is both safe and efficient. As of 1970, a variety of traditional knowledge-based approaches such as Personal Identification Recognition Number (PIRN), passwords, and other similar methods have been made available; however, many token-based approaches such as drivers' licenses, passports, credit cards, bank accounts, ID cards, and keys have also been made available; however, they have all failed to establish a secure and reliable transaction channel. Because they are easily misplaced, stolen, or lost, they are usually unable to protect secrecy or authenticate the identity of a legitimate claimant. Aside from that, personally identifiable information such as passwords and PINs is very prone to fraud since they are easily forgotten or guessed by an imposter. Biometric identification and authentication (commonly known as biometrics) are attracting a great deal of attention these days, particularly in the realm of information security systems, due to its inherent potential and advantages over other conventional ways for identifying and authenticating. As a result of the device's unique biological characteristics, which include features such as fingerprints, facepalms, hand geometry (including the iris), and the device's iris, it can be used in a variety of contexts, such as consumer banking kiosks, airport security systems, international ports of entry, universities, office buildings, and forensics, to name a few. It is also used in several other contexts, including forensics and law enforcement. Consequently, every layer of the system-sensed data, computation, and processing of data, as well as the storage and administration of data-is susceptible to a broad variety of threats and weaknesses (cloud). There does not seem to be any suitable methods for dealing with the large volumes of data created by the fog computing architecture when normal data storage and security technologies are used. Because of this, the major objective of this research is to design security countermeasures against medical data mining vulnerabilities that originate from the sensing layer and data storage in the Internet of Things' cloud database, both of which are discussed in more depth further down. A key allows for the creation of a distributed ledger database and provides an immutable security solution, transaction transparency, and the prohibition of tampering with patient information. This mechanism is particularly useful in healthcare settings, where patient information must be kept confidential. When used in a hospital environment, this method is extremely beneficial. As a result of incorporating blockchain technology into the fog paradigm, it is possible to alleviate some of the current concerns associated with latency, centralization, and scalability.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of information provided by ChatGPT, in response to frequently asked questions about radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for varicose veins. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted at The Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan. A set of 18 frequently asked questions regarding RFA for varicose veins were compiled from credible online sources and presented to ChatGPT twice, separately, using the new chat option. Twelve experienced vascular surgeons (with >2 years of experience and >= 20 RFA procedures performed annually) independently evaluated the accuracy of the responses using a 4-point Likert scale and assessed their reproducibility. Results: Most evaluators were males (n = 10/12 [83.3%]) with an average of 12.3 +/- 6.2 years of experience as a vascular surgeon. Six evaluators (50%) were from the UK followed by three from Saudi Arabia (25.0%), two from Pakistan (16.7%), and one from the United States (8.3%). Among the 216 accuracy grades, most of the evaluators graded the responses as comprehensive (n = 87/216 [40.3%]) or accurate but insufficient (n = 70/216 [32.4%]), whereas only 17.1% (n = 37/216) were graded as a mixture of both accurate and inaccurate information and 10.8% (n = 22/216) as entirely inaccurate. Overall, 89.8% of the responses (n = 194/216) were deemed reproducible. Of the total responses, 70.4% (n = 152/216) were classified as good quality and reproducible. The remaining responses were poor quality with 19.4% reproducible (n = 42/216) and 10.2% nonreproducible (n = 22/216). There was nonsignificant inter-rater disagreement among the vascular surgeons for overall responses (Fleiss' kappa, -0.028; P = .131). Conclusions: ChatGPT provided generally accurate and reproducible information on RFA for varicose veins; however, variability in response quality and limited inter-rater reliability highlight the need for further improvements. Although it has the potential to enhance patient education and support healthcare decision-making, improvements in its training, validation, transparency, and mechanisms to address inaccurate or incomplete information are essential.

AB  - BackgroundThe escalating mental health crisis during and post-COVID-19 underscores the urgent need for scalable, timely, cost-effective assessment solutions for general psychotic disorders. Regretfully, traditional symptom-based, one-to-one assessment face inherent limitations in large-scale and longitudinal screening, likely delaying early intervention.MethodsWe developed MentalAId, an improved densely connected convolutional network (DenseNet) model, to assist automated psychosis recognition, leveraging accessible routine laboratory data without requiring additional specialized tests. MentalAId learned subtle variations in 49 routine clinical hematological tests and two demographic variables (sex and age) across 28,746 individuals spanning four distinct cohorts: psychotic inpatients (n = 9,271), non-psychotic inpatients with various diseases (n = 14,508), healthy controls (n = 1,826), and drug-na & iuml;ve first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients (n = 3,141).ResultsThe MentalAId model achieved high accuracy in generally discriminating psychoses from both healthy individuals and patients with other physical diseases, achieving 93.3% accuracy and AUC of 0.983. Further validating its robustness, MentalAId demonstrated high performance under real-world clinical conditions, accurately handling extreme values and missing values, with accuracies of 92.4% and 92.0%, respectively. Even encompassing the drug-na & iuml;ve FEPs, MentalAId maintained an accuracy of 91.9%, underscoring its translational potential for early FEP recognition. Interpretability analyses identified indirect bilirubin, direct bilirubin, and basophil ratio as potential metabolic indicators.ConclusionsCollectively, MentalAId offers an accessible, affordable, and scalable solution to assist timely psychosis assessment and monitoring, irrespective of the complexity of pathology or manifestation of symptoms. By requiring standard blood tests solely, it can be easily integrated into existing healthcare workflow. This empowers long-term and population-wide monitoring of disease progression and prognosis, particularly during public health crises like COVID-19.

AB  - Healthcare researchers are increasingly utilizing smartphone sensor data as a scalable and cost-effective approach to studying individualized health-related behaviors in real-world settings. However, to develop reliable and robust digital behavioral signatures that may help in the early prediction of the individualized disease trajectory and future prognosis, there is a critical need to quantify the potential variability that may be present in the underlying sensor data due to variations in the smartphone hardware and software used by large population. Using sensor data collected in real-world settings from 3000 participants' smartphones for up to 84 days, we compared differences in the completeness, correctness, and consistency of the three most common smartphone sensors-the accelerometer, gyroscope, and GPS- within and across Android and iOS devices. Our findings show considerable variation in sensor data quality within and across Android and iOS devices. Sensor data from iOS devices showed significantly lower levels of anomalous point density (APD) compared to Android across all sensors (p < 1 x 10(-4)). iOS devices showed a considerably lower missing data ratio (MDR) for the accelerometer compared to the GPS data (p < 1 x 10(-4)). Notably, the quality features derived from raw sensor data across devices alone could predict the device type (Android vs. iOS) with an up to 0.98 accuracy 95% CI [0.977, 0.982]. Such significant differences in sensor data quantity and quality gathered from iOS and Android platforms could lead to considerable variation in health-related inference derived from heterogenous consumer-owned smartphones. Our research highlights the importance of assessing, measuring, and adjusting for such critical differences in smartphone sensor-based assessments. Understanding the factors contributing to the variation in sensor data based on daily device usage will help develop reliable, standardized, inclusive, and practically applicable digital behavioral patterns that may be linked to health outcomes in real-world settings.

TI  - Evidence Based Gait Analysis Interpretation Tools (EB-GAIT) treatment recommendation and outcome prediction models to support decision-making based on clinical gait analysis data
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
KW  - CHILDREN
AB  - Clinical gait analysis (CGA) has historically relied on clinician experience and judgment, leading to modest, stagnant, and unpredictable outcomes. This paper introduces Evidence-Based Gait Analysis Interpretation Tools (EB-GAIT), a novel framework leveraging machine learning to support treatment decisions. The core of EB-GAIT consists of two key components: (1) treatment recommendation models, which are models that estimate the probability of specific surgeries based on historical standard-of-practice (SOP), and (2) treatment outcome models, which predict changes in patient characteristics following treatment or natural history. Using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART), we developed and validated treatment recommendation models for 12 common surgeries that account for more than 95% of the surgery recorded in our CGA center's database. These models demonstrated high balanced accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. We used Shapley values for the models to enhances interpretability and allow clinicians and patients to understand the factors driving treatment recommendations. We also developed treatment outcome models for over 20 common outcome measures. These models were found to be unbiased, with reliable prediction intervals and accuracy comparable to experimental measurement error. We illustrated the application of EB-GAIT through a case study, showcasing its utility in providing treatment recommendations and outcome predictions. We then use simulations to show that combining recommendation and outcome models offers the possibility to improve outcomes for treated limbs, maintain outcomes for untreated limbs, and reduce the number of surgeries performed. For example, under the counterfactual situation where femoral derotation osteotomies are administered only when they align with historical standard of practice (> 50% probability of surgery) and are predicted to improve the Gait Deviation Index (change > 7.5 points), the model predicts a 11 percentage point reduction in surgeries (26% limbs currently, 15% limbs simulated), a 6 point improvement in Gait Deviation Index among treated limbs (6 currently, 12 simulated), and no change in Gait Deviation Index for untreated limbs (2 currently, 2 simulated). EB-GAIT represents a significant step toward precision medicine in CGA, offering a promising tool to enhance treatment outcomes and patient care. The EB-GAIT approach addresses the limitations of the conventional CGA interpretation method, offering a more structured and data-driven decision-making process. EB-GAIT is not intended to replace clinical judgment but to supplement it, providing clinicians with a second opinion grounded in historical data and predictive analytics. While the models perform well, their effectiveness is constrained by historical variability in treatment decisions and the inherent complexity of patient outcomes. Future efforts should focus on refining model inputs, incorporating surgical details, and pooling data from multiple centers to improve generalizability.

AB  - PurposeOnline consumer health forums serve as a way for the public to connect with medical professionals. While these medical forums offer a valuable service, online Question Answering (QA) forums can struggle to deliver timely answers due to the limited number of available healthcare professionals. One way to solve this problem is by developing an automatic QA system that can provide patients with quicker answers. One key component of such a system could be a module for classifying the semantic type of a question. This would allow the system to understand the patient's intent and route them towards the relevant information.MethodsThis paper proposes a novel two-step approach to address the challenge of semantic type classification in Indonesian consumer health questions. We acknowledge the scarcity of Indonesian health domain data, a hurdle for machine learning models. To address this gap, we first introduce a novel corpus of annotated Indonesian consumer health questions. Second, we utilize this newly created corpus to build and evaluate a data-driven predictive model for classifying question semantic types. To enhance the trustworthiness and interpretability of the model's predictions, we employ an explainable model framework, LIME. This framework facilitates a deeper understanding of the role played by word-based features in the model's decision-making process. Additionally, it empowers us to conduct a comprehensive bias analysis, allowing for the detection of "semantic bias", where words with no inherent association with a specific semantic type disproportionately influence the model's predictions.ResultsThe annotation process revealed moderate agreement between expert annotators. In addition, not all words with high LIME probability could be considered true characteristics of a question type. This suggests a potential bias in the data used and the machine learning models themselves. Notably, XGBoost, Na & iuml;ve Bayes, and MLP models exhibited a tendency to predict questions containing the words "kanker" (cancer) and "depresi" (depression) as belonging to the DIAGNOSIS category. In terms of prediction performance, Perceptron and XGBoost emerged as the top-performing models, achieving the highest weighted average F1 scores across all input scenarios and weighting factors. Na & iuml;ve Bayes performed best after balancing the data with Borderline SMOTE, indicating its promise for handling imbalanced datasets.ConclusionWe constructed a corpus of query semantics in the domain of Indonesian consumer health, containing 964 questions annotated with their corresponding semantic types. This corpus served as the foundation for building a predictive model. We further investigated the impact of disease-biased words on model performance. These words exhibited high LIME scores, yet lacked association with a specific semantic type. We trained models using datasets with and without these biased words and found no significant difference in model performance between the two scenarios, suggesting that the models might possess an ability to mitigate the influence of such bias during the learning process.

AB  - Smoking has a serious complicated impact on Cardiovascular Health (CVH), which makes it an easily controlled risk factor for Cardiovascular Disease (CVD). The importance of early diagnosis and treatment is crucial because of CVD, which remains to be the leading cause of morbidity and death across the globe, therefore, smoking behaviour prediction is essential. This research explores the complex relationship between smoking and CVD, and clarifies how smoking negatively impacts CVH. The first step of the analysis is removing the Not-a-Number (NaN) values in the smoking behaviour bio signals data because all NaN values are in the target column 'smoking', which could lead to generate biased predictions. Further, robust scaling is applied to standardize the data, where all features are on the same scale. The Random Forest feature selection technique is applied to select the most relevant features for smoking status prediction. The Borderline-Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique is used to balance the minority class with the majority class, to reduce the risk of overfitting in results. Finally, the cleaned and preprocessed data is passed to the Proposed Blending Model (PBM). In PBM, the Echo State Network and GoogleNet are placed on the base layer, and AlexNet is placed on the meta layer to make a robust smoking status prediction model. In terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score, the PBM outperforms the baseline techniques with an improvement score of 5%, 6%, 5%, and 7%, respectively. Additionally, the PBM's results are validated through a 10-fold cross-validation method, which can increase its reliability and durability. Finally, the SHapley Additive exPlanations technique is used to understand the predictions made by the PBM. It can reveal the explainability and interpretability of the PBM. Conclusively, during the thorough simulation process, the results are collected and the ablation study is performed. The simulation results show that the early prediction of hidden smokers can help to reduce the effect of the CVDs. It also makes proactive healthcare strategies possible for better future outcomes and public health.

AB  - Spinal cord hemangioblastomas are rare, benign, intradural tumors that, despite their nonmalignant histopathology, can lead to substantial neurological morbidity. While disparities in outcomes based on race and socioeconomic status have been well-documented in other spinal tumor populations, their role in spinal cord hemangioblastoma remains poorly understood. In this study, we utilize the National Cancer Database (NCDB) to evaluate the influence of race, socioeconomic factors, and healthcare access on survival outcomes in patients with spinal cord hemangioblastoma. Additionally, we explore the utility of machine learning-based survival models to improve individualized risk prediction and to identify key clinical and sociodemographic determinants of long-term survival. Patients diagnosed with spinal cord hemangioblastoma were identified from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) using ICD-O-3 histology and topography codes. Demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical variables were compared across racial groups (White, Black and Asian). Long-term overall survival (OS) was defined as survival beyond 10 years. Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate survival outcomes and identify independent predictors of mortality. Tumor size was stratified using the cohort-wide mean (62.2 mm) for interpretability. Temporal trends in racial distribution and surgical technique (open vs. MIS) were assessed using Mann-Kendall trend testing. Gradient Boosting Survival, Cox proportional hazards, and Random Survival Forest models were developed and validated for mortality prediction. The best-performing model was interpreted using SHAP analysis. A total of 716 adult patients with spinal cord hemangioblastoma were analyzed, with the majority being White (83.7%), followed by Black (12.3%) and Asian (4%). Significant differences were observed across racial groups in age, insurance status, income quartiles, and comorbidity scores, though sex distribution and facility type utilization were comparable. Most patients were treated at academic centers, and surgery alone was the predominant treatment modality, with no racial disparities in extent of resection or use of radiation. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed significantly higher 10-year and long-term mortality in White patients; however, race was not an independent predictor in multivariable Cox regression, where increased age, higher CDCC scores, urban residence, and treatment at comprehensive community cancer centers were associated with worse survival. Surgery, with or without radiation, was protective compared to radiation alone. Temporal analysis showed stable racial distribution and minimal uptake of minimally invasive surgery from 2010 to 2017. The Gradient Boosting Survival model achieved the highest predictive performance (AUC = 0.8214; C-index = 0.7817), with age, facility type, and comorbidity burden identified as the strongest predictors of mortality in SHAP analysis. A publicly available web-based calculator was developed based on this model to provide individualized survival estimates. Racial and socioeconomic disparities were associated with differences in clinical outcomes on univariate analysis. However, race and insurance status were not independent predictors of mortality in multivariable-adjusted models. This suggests that the observed survival differences may be explained by confounding factors, such as comorbidity burden, treatment modality, or access to specialized care.
   Notably, poorer survival was independently associated with treatment at Comprehensive Community Cancer Programs and with higher comorbidity scores, underscoring the importance of ensuring equitable access to high-volume, specialized centers. Lastly, the Gradient Boosting Survival model enhanced mortality risk prediction by incorporating both clinical and socioeconomic variables, supporting its potential utility in guiding targeted interventions to improve long-term outcomes.

AB  - Background: Health care insurance fraud is on the rise in many ways, such as falsifying information and hiding third-partyliability. This can result in significant losses for the medical health insurance industry. Consequently, fraud detection is crucial.Currently, companies employ auditors who manually evaluate records and pinpoint fraud. However, an automated and effectivemethod is needed to detect fraud with the continually increasing number of patients seeking health insurance. Blockchain is anemerging technology and is constantly evolving to meet business needs. With its characteristics of immutability, transparency,traceability, and smart contracts, it demonstrates its potential in the health care domain. In particular, self-executable smartcontracts are essential to reduce the costs associated with traditional paradigms, which are mostly manual, while preservingprivacy and building trust among health care stakeholders, including the patient and the health insurance networks. However,with the proliferation of blockchain development platform options, selecting the right one for health care insurance can be difficult.This study addressed this void and developed an automated decision map recommender system to select the most effectiveblockchain platform for insurance fraud detection.Objective: This study aims to develop smart contracts for detecting health care insurance fraud efficiently. Therefore, weprovided a taxonomy of fraud scenarios and implemented their detection using a blockchain platform that was suitable for healthcare insurance fraud detection. To automatically and efficiently select the best platform, we proposed and implemented a decisionmap-based recommender system. For developing the decision-map, we proposed a taxonomy of 102 blockchain platforms.Methods: We developed smart contracts for 12 fraud scenarios that we identified in the literature. We used the top 2 blockchainplatforms selected by our proposed decision-making map-based recommender system, which is tailored for health care insurancefraud. The map used our taxonomy of 102 blockchain platforms classified according to their application domains.Results: The recommender system demonstrated that Hyperledger Fabric was the best blockchain platform for identifying healthcare insurance fraud. We validated our recommender system by comparing the performance of the top 2 platforms selected byour system. The blockchain platform taxonomy that we created revealed that 59 blockchain platforms are suitable for all applicationdomains, 25 are suitable for financial services, and 18 are suitable for various application domains. We implemented frauddetection based on smart contracts.Conclusions: Our decision map recommender system, which was based on our proposed taxonomy of 102 platforms, automaticallyselected the top 2 platforms, which were Hyperledger Fabric and Neo, for the implementation of health care insurance frauddetection. Our performance evaluation of the 2 platforms indicated that Fabric surpassed Neo in all performance metrics, asdepicted by our recommender system. We provided an implementation of fraud detection based on smart contracts

AB  - Background AI models have shown promise in performing many medical imaging tasks. However, our ability to explain what signals these models have learned is severely lacking. Explanations are needed in order to increase the trust of doctors in AI -based models, especially in domains where AI prediction capabilities surpass those of humans. Moreover, such explanations could enable novel scienti fi c discovery by uncovering signals in the data that aren ' t yet known to experts. Methods In this paper, we present a work fl ow for generating hypotheses to understand which visual signals in images are correlated with a classi fi cation model ' s predictions for a given task. This approach leverages an automatic visual explanation algorithm followed by interdisciplinary expert review. We propose the following 4 steps: (i) Train a classi fi er to perform a given task to assess whether the imagery indeed contains signals relevant to the task; (ii) Train a StyleGAN-based image generator with an architecture that enables guidance by the classi fi er ( " StylEx " ); (iii) Automatically detect, extract, and visualize the top visual attributes that the classi fi er is sensitive towards. For visualization, we independently modify each of these attributes to generate counterfactual visualizations for a set of images (i.e., what the image would look like with the attribute increased or decreased); (iv) Formulate hypotheses for the underlying mechanisms, to stimulate future research. Speci fi cally, present the discovered attributes and corresponding counterfactual visualizations to an interdisciplinary panel of experts so that hypotheses can account for social and structural determinants of health (e.g., whether the attributes correspond to known patho-physiological or socio-cultural phenomena, or could be novel discoveries). Findings To demonstrate the broad applicability of our approach, we present results on eight prediction tasks across three medical imaging modalities - retinal fundus photographs, external eye photographs, and chest radiographs. We showcase examples where many of the automatically-learned attributes clearly capture clinically known features (e.g., types of cataract, enlarged heart), and demonstrate automatically-learned confounders that arise from factors beyond physiological mechanisms (e.g., chest X-ray underexposure is correlated with the classi fi er predicting abnormality, and eye makeup is correlated with the classi fi er predicting low hemoglobin levels). We further show that our method reveals a number of physiologically plausible, previously-unknown attributes based on the literature (e.g., differences in the fundus associated with self-reported sex, which were previously unknown). Interpretation Our approach enables hypotheses generation via attribute visualizations and has the potential to enable researchers to better understand, improve their assessment, and extract new knowledge from AI -based models, as well as debug and design better datasets. Though not designed to infer causality, importantly, we highlight that attributes generated by our framework can capture phenomena beyond physiology or pathophysiology, re fl ecting the real world nature of healthcare delivery and socio-cultural factors, and hence interdisciplinary perspectives are critical in these investigations. Finally, we will release code to help researchers train their own StylEx models and analyze their predictive tasks of interest, and use the methodology presented in this paper for responsible interpretation of the revealed attributes.
