  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning (DL) have demonstrated remarkable potential in enhancing medical diagnosis across various specialties. However, the inherent complexity and opacity of these models pose significant challenges in clinical adoption, particularly due to the critical nature of healthcare decisions. This research paper explores the development of interpretable deep learning models for medical diagnosis, focusing on the integration of Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to enhance transparency, accountability, and trust in AI-assisted medical decision-making. We investigate various XAI methodologies, their application in different medical domains, and their impact on diagnostic accuracy and clinical interpretability. Through a comprehensive analysis of case studies, we demonstrate how explainable models can not only maintain high diagnostic performance but also provide valuable insights into their decision-making processes, potentially revolutionizing the synergy between AI and human expertise in healthcare.},

  abstract = {Machine learning models have had discernible achievements in a myriad of applications. However, most of these models are black-boxes, and it is obscure how the decisions are made by them. This makes the models unreliable and untrustworthy. To provide insights into the decision making processes of these models, a variety of traditional interpretable models have been proposed. Moreover, to generate more humanfriendly explanations, recent work on interpretability tries to answer questions related to causality such as "Why does this model makes such decisions?" or "Was it a specific feature that caused the decision made by the model?". In this work, models that aim to answer causal questions are referred to as causal interpretable models. The existing surveys have covered concepts and methodologies of traditional interpretability. In this work, we present a comprehensive survey on causal interpretable models from the aspects of the problems and methods. In addition, this survey provides in-depth insights into the existing evaluation metrics for measuring interpretability, which can help practitioners understand for what scenarios each evaluation metric is suitable.},

However, the large global community of healthcare professionals, many of whom routinely face potentially life-or-death outcomes with complex medicolegal consequences, have yet to embrace this powerful technology. The major problem is that most current AI solutions function as a metaphorical black-box positioned between input data and output decisions without a rigorous explanation for their internal processes. With the goal of enhancing trust and improving acceptance of artificial intelligence-- (AI) based technology in clinical medicine, there is a large and growing effort to address this challenge using eXplainable AI (XAI), a set of techniques, strategies, and algorithms with an explicit focus on explaining the ``hows and whys'' of DNNs. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art XAI techniques concerning healthcare applications and discuss current challenges and future directions. We emphasize the strengths and limitations of each category, including image, tabular, and textual explanations, and explore a range of evaluation metrics for assessing the effectiveness of XAI solutions. Finally, we highlight promising opportunities for XAI research to enhance the acceptance of DNNs by the healthcare community.},

While their superior performance offers considerable benefits, their inherent complexity often decreases human trust, which slows their application in high-risk decision-making domains, such as finance. The field of explainable AI (XAI) seeks to bridge this gap, aiming to make AI models more understandable. This survey, focusing on published work from 2018 to 2024, categorizes XAI approaches that predict financial time series. In this article, explainability and interpretability are distinguished, emphasizing the need to treat these concepts separately, as they are not applied the same way in practice. Through clear definitions, a rigorous taxonomy of XAI approaches, a complementary characterization, and examples of XAI's application in the finance industry, this article provides a comprehensive view of XAI's current role in finance. It can also serve as a guide for selecting the most appropriate XAI approach for future applications.},

  abstract = {The success of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has led to a need for understanding their decision-making process and providing explanations for their predictions, which has given rise to explainable AI (XAI) that offers transparent explanations for black-box models. Recently, the use of prototypes has successfully improved the explainability of models by learning prototypes to imply training graphs that affect the prediction. However, these approaches tend to provide prototypes with excessive information from the entire graph, leading to the exclusion of key substructures or the inclusion of irrelevant substructures, which can limit both the interpretability and the performance of the model in downstream tasks. In this work, we propose a novel framework of explainable GNNs, called interpretable Prototype-based Graph Information Bottleneck (PGIB), that incorporates prototype learning within the information bottleneck framework to provide prototypes with the key subgraph from the input graph that is important for the model prediction. This is the first work that incorporates prototype learning into the process of identifying the key subgraphs that have a critical impact on the prediction performance. Extensive experiments, including qualitative analysis, demonstrate that PGIB outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both prediction performance and explainability. The source code of PGIB is available at https://github.com/sang-woo-seo/PGIB.},

This review explores the key benefits of XAI in enhancing diagnostic accuracy, personalizing patient care, and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards. However, despite its advantages, XAI faces significant challenges, including balancing model accuracy with interpretability, scaling for real-time clinical use, and mitigating biases inherent in medical data. Ethical concerns, particularly surrounding fairness and accountability, are also discussed in relation to AI's growing role in healthcare. The review emphasizes the importance of developing hybrid models that combine high accuracy with improved interpretability and suggests that future research should focus on explainable-by-design systems, reducing computational costs, and addressing ethical issues. As AI continues to integrate into healthcare, XAI will play an essential role in ensuring that AI systems are transparent, accountable, and aligned with the ethical standards required in clinical practice.},

While local XAI methods explain individual predictions in the form of attribution maps, thereby identifying `where' important features occur (but not providing information about `what' they represent), global explanation techniques visualize what concepts a model has generally learned to encode. Both types of method thus provide only partial insights and leave the burden of interpreting the model's reasoning to the user. Here we introduce the Concept Relevance Propagation (CRP) approach, which combines the local and global perspectives and thus allows answering both the `where' and `what' questions for individual predictions. We demonstrate the capability of our method in various settings, showcasing that CRP leads to more human interpretable explanations and provides deep insights into the model's representation and reasoning through concept atlases, concept-composition analyses, and quantitative investigations of concept subspaces and their role in fine-grained decision-making.},

  abstract = {At the dawn of the fourth industrial revolution, we are witnessing a fast and widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in our daily life, which contributes to accelerating the shift towards a more algorithmic society. However, even with such unprecedented advancements, a key impediment to the use of AI-based systems is that they often lack transparency. Indeed, the black-box nature of these systems allows powerful predictions, but it cannot be directly explained. This issue has triggered a new debate on explainable AI (XAI). A research field holds substantial promise for improving trust and transparency of AI-based systems. It is recognized as the sine qua non for AI to continue making steady progress without disruption. This survey provides an entry point for interested researchers and practitioners to learn key aspects of the young and rapidly growing body of research related to XAI.

In this paper, we propose a novel way to analyze and measure the robustness of the state of the art models w.r.t semantic visual variations as well as propose ways to make models more robust against spurious correlations. Our method performs automated semantic image manipulations and tests for consistency in model predictions to quantify the model robustness as well as generate synthetic data to counter these problems. We perform our analysis on three diverse, state of the art VQA models and diverse question types with a particular focus on challenging counting questions. In addition, we show that models can be made significantly more robust against inconsistent predictions using our edited data. Finally, we show that results also translate to real-world error cases of state of the art models, which results in improved overall performance.},

Although many studies have proposed effective solutions for the early detection and prediction of COVID-19 with Machine Learning (ML) and Deep learning (DL) based techniques, but these models remain vulnerable to data privacy and security breaches. To overcome the challenges of existing systems, we introduced Adaptive Differential Privacy-based Federated Learning (DPFL) model for predicting COVID-19 disease from chest X-ray images which introduces an innovative adaptive mechanism that dynamically adjusts privacy levels based on real-time data sensitivity analysis, improving the practical applicability of Federated Learning (FL) in diverse healthcare environments. We compared and analyzed the performance of this distributed learning model with a traditional centralized model. Moreover, we enhance the model by integrating a FL approach with an early stopping mechanism to achieve efficient COVID-19 prediction with minimal communication overhead. To ensure privacy without compromising model utility and accuracy, we evaluated the proposed model under various noise scales. Finally, we discussed strategies for increasing the model's accuracy while maintaining robustness as well as privacy.},

The impact of selection bias in the observational data is alleviated via a propensity-dropout regularization scheme, in which the network is thinned for every training example via a dropout probability that depends on the associated propensity score. The network is trained in alternating phases, where in each phase we use the training examples of one of the two potential outcomes (treated and control populations) to update the weights of the shared layers and the respective outcome-specific layers. Experiments conducted on data based on a real-world observational study show that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art.},

  abstract = {The entry of artificial intelligence into health care systems brings unprecedented advances in diagnosing, personalized treatment, and predictive analytics. Many of these AI models, especially the deep-learning algorithms, have been referred to as "black boxes" and raise gigantic questions about trust, transparency, and reliability in clinical settings. Therefore, explainable AI answers the challenges by drawing to the fore methodologies that make AI models more interpretable, thereby making them more accepted and usable in the fraternity of health. It engages with XAI in healthcare by scrutinizing various aspects of feature importance analysis, architectures of the interpretable model, and visual explication of decisions driven by AI. The case studies regarding applications of XAI in the fields of radiology, disease prediction, and personalized medicine illustrate how this technology has its own importance even in terms of improving the precision of diagnosis and clinician-patient communication. We are answerable to ethics, such as how to explain respect for the trust of patients, legalities in deploying XAI in healthcare, and further directions to be taken so that XAI does not lag behind the timeline of AI innovation. Our results repeat again that XAI indeed is the much-needed solution to be technically suitable and necessary for ensuring the responsible adoption of AI within healthcare systems to empower clinicians using not only accurate but also transparent, understandable, and aligned AI systems in clinical best practice. In conclusion, this paper concludes by highlighting explainable AI as one of the key enablers toward safe, effective, and widely accepted AI applications in health care.},

In digital pathology, large whole slide images (WSIs) are decomposed into smaller tiles and tile-derived features are processed by attention-based multiple instance learning (ABMIL) models to predict WSI-level labels. These networks generate tile-specific attention weights, which can be visualized as attention maps for interpretability. However, a standardized evaluation framework for these maps is lacking, questioning their reliability and ability to detect spurious correlations that can mislead models. We herein propose a framework to assess the ability of attention networks to attend to relevant features in digital pathology by creating artificial model confounders and using dedicated interpretability metrics. Models are trained and evaluated on data with tile modifications correlated with WSI labels, enabling the analysis of model sensitivity to artificial confounders and the accuracy of attention maps in highlighting them. Confounders are introduced either through synthetic tile modifications or through tile ablations based on their specific image-based features, with the latter being used to assess more clinically relevant scenarios. We also analyze the impact of varying confounder quantities at both the tile and WSI levels. Our results show that ABMIL models perform as desired within our framework. While attention maps generally highlight relevant regions, their robustness is affected by the type and number of confounders. Our versatile framework has the potential to be used in the evaluation of various methods and the exploration of image-based features driving model predictions, which could aid in biomarker discovery.},

These challenges are met by incorporating a recent augmentation solution called SnapMix, by a new patch embedding technique, and by performing a test-time stability analysis. The three techniques are complementary and are all based on utilizing the heatmaps produced by the Class Activation Mapping (CAM) explainability method. Compared to the current state of the art, we obtain an increase of five percent in the F1 score on a site with a relatively high number of cases, and a gap twice as large for a site with much fewer training images.},

Our approach identifies both spurious and invariant latent features necessary for achieving accurate reconstruction by placing distinct conditional priors on latent features. The invariant signals are disentangled from noise by enforcing independence which facilitates the construction of an interpretable model with a causal semantic. By exploiting the interplay between data domains and labels, our method simultaneously identifies invariant features and builds invariant predictors. We apply our method to grand biological challenges, such as data integration in single-cell genomics with the aim of capturing biological variations across datasets with many samples, obtained from different conditions or multiple laboratories. Our approach allows for the incorporation of specific biological mechanisms, including gene programs, disease states, or treatment conditions into the data integration process, bridging the gap between the theoretical assumptions and real biological applications. Specifically, the proposed approach helps to disentangle biological signals from data biases that are unrelated to the target task or the causal explanation of interest. Through extensive benchmarking using large-scale human hematopoiesis and human lung cancer data, we validate the superiority of our approach over existing methods and demonstrate that it can empower deeper insights into cellular heterogeneity and the identification of disease cell states.},

Additionally, an XAI model was used to explain the decision-making process of the deep learning model, providing insights into which features of the CT scan were most important for the model's diagnosis. ResNet50 achieved the highest performance with 100\% accuracy on testing images, and InceptionV3 got 99.92\%. LIME and GRAD-CAM explained the model's performance by highlighting the most important features for each model. On the other hand, radiologists provided insight on whether the deep learning and XAI models are correct by determining the cancer region in each image and point out the model's misclassification. The results show that the radiologist's diagnosis is important even though the model's accuracy is high.},

  abstract = {Due to the complexity of medical images, traditional medical image classification methods have been unable to meet the actual application needs. In recent years, the rapid development of deep learning theory has provided a technical approach for solving medical image classification. However, deep learning has the following problems in the application of medical image classification. First, it is impossible to construct a deep learning model with excellent performance according to the characteristics of medical images. Second, the current deep learning network structure and training strategies are less adaptable to medical images. Therefore, this paper first introduces the visual attention mechanism into the deep learning model so that the information can be extracted more effectively according to the problem of medical images, and the reasoning is realized at a finer granularity. It can increase the interpretability of the model. Additionally, to solve the problem of matching the deep learning network structure and training strategy to medical images, this paper will construct a novel multiscale convolutional neural network model that can automatically extract high-level discriminative appearance features from the original image, and the loss function uses the Mahalanobis distance optimization model to obtain a better training strategy, which can improve the robust performance of the network model. The medical image classification task is completed by the above method. Based on the above ideas, this paper proposes a medical classification algorithm based on a visual attention mechanism-multiscale convolutional neural network. The lung nodules and breast cancer images were classified by the method in this paper. The experimental results show that the accuracy of medical image classification in this paper is not only higher than that of traditional machine learning methods but also improved compared with other deep learning methods, and the method has good stability and robustness.},

  abstract = {Background~           PATHFx is a clinical decision-support tool based on machine learning capable of estimating the likelihood of survival after surgery for patients with skeletal metastases. The applicability of any machine-learning tool depends not only on successful external validation in unique patient populations but also on remaining relevant as more effective systemic treatments are introduced. With advancements in the treatment of metastatic disease, it is our responsibility to patients to ensure clinical support tools remain contemporary and accurate.           Question/purposes~           Therefore, we sought to (1) generate updated PATHFx models using recent data from patients treated at one large, urban tertiary referral center and (2) externally validate the models using two contemporary patient populations treated either surgically or nonsurgically with external-beam radiotherapy alone for symptomatic skeletal metastases for symptomatic lesions.           Methods~           After obtaining institutional review board approval, we collected data on 208 patients undergoing surgical treatment for pathologic fractures at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center between 2015 and 2018. These data were combined with the original PATHFx training set (n = 189) to create the final training set (n = 397). We then created six Bayesian belief networks designed to estimate the likelihood of 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, 12-month, 18-month, and 24-month survival after treatment. Bayesian belief analysis is a statistical method that allows data-driven learning to arise from conditional probabilities by exploring relationships between variables to estimate the likelihood of an outcome using observed data. For external validation, we extracted the records of patients treated between 2016 and 2018 from the International Bone Metastasis Registry and records of patients treated nonoperatively with external-beam radiation therapy for symptomatic skeletal metastases from 2012 to 2016 using the Military Health System Data Repository (radiotherapy-only group). From each record, we collected the date of treatment, laboratory values at the time of treatment initiation, demographic data, details of diagnosis, and the date of death. All records reported sufficient follow-up to establish survival (yes/no) at 24-months after treatment. For external validation, we applied the data from each record to the new PATHFx models. We assessed calibration (calibration plots), accuracy (Brier score), discriminatory ability (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]).           Results~           The updated PATHFx version 3.0 models successfully classified survival at each time interval in both external validation sets and demonstrated appropriate discriminatory ability and model calibration. The Bayesian models were reasonably calibrated to the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center training set. External validation with 197 records from the International Bone Metastasis Registry and 192 records from the Military Health System Data Repository for analysis found Brier scores that were all less than 0.20, with upper bounds of the 95\% confidence intervals all less than 0.25, both for the radiotherapy-only and International Bone Metastasis Registry groups. Additionally, AUC estimates were all greater than 0.70, with lower bounds of the 95\% CI all greater than 0.68, except for the 1-month radiotherapy-only group. To complete external validation, decision curve analysis demonstrated clinical utility. This means it was better to use the PATHFx models when compared to the default assumption that all or no patients would survive at all time periods except for the 1-month models. We believe the favorable Brier scores ({$<$} 0.20) as well as DCA indicate these models are suitable for clinical use.           Conclusions~           We successfully updated PATHFx using contemporary data from patients undergoing either surgical or nonsurgical treatment for symptomatic skeletal metastases. These models have been incorporated for clinical use on PATHFx version 3.0 (https://www.pathfx.org). Clinically, external validation suggests it is better to use PATHFx version 3.0 for all time periods except when deciding whether to give radiotherapy to patients with the life expectancy of less than 1 month. This is partly because most patients survived 1-month after treatment. With the advancement of medical technology in treatment and diagnosis for patients with metastatic bone disease, part of our fiduciary responsibility is to the main current clinical support tools.           Level of Evidence~           Level III, therapeutic study.},

Although they have yielded impressive results in terms of model accuracy and predictive ability, most of these applications are based on "Black-box" algorithms and more interpretable models have been claimed by the research community. The recent eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) revolution offers a solution for this issue, were rule-based approaches are highly suitable for explanatory purposes. The further integration of the data mining process along with functional-annotation and pathway analyses is an additional way towards more explanatory and biologically soundness models. In this paper, we present a novel rule-based XAI strategy (including pre-processing, knowledge-extraction and functional validation) for finding biologically relevant sequential patterns from longitudinal human gene expression data (GED). To illustrate the performance of our pipeline, we work on in vivo temporal GED collected within the course of a long-term dietary intervention in 57 subjects with obesity (GSE77962). As validation populations, we employ three independent datasets following the same experimental design. As a result, we validate primarily extracted gene patterns and prove the goodness of our strategy for the mining of biologically relevant gene-gene temporal relations. Our whole pipeline has been gathered under open-source software and could be easily extended to other human temporal GED applications.},

  abstract = {Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) more broadly have great immediate and future potential for transforming almost all aspects of medicine. However, in many applications, even outside medicine, a lack of transparency in AI applications has become increasingly problematic. This is particularly pronounced where users need to interpret the output of AI systems. Explainable AI (XAI) provides a rationale that allows users to understand why a system has produced a given output. The output can then be interpreted within a given context. One area that is in great need of XAI is that of Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSSs). These systems support medical practitioners in their clinic decision-making and in the absence of explainability may lead to issues of under or over-reliance. Providing explanations for how recommendations are arrived at will allow practitioners to make more nuanced, and in some cases, life-saving decisions. The need for XAI in CDSS, and the medical field in general, is amplified by the need for ethical and fair decision-making and the fact that AI trained with historical data can be a reinforcement agent of historical actions and biases that should be uncovered. We performed a systematic literature review of work to-date in the application of XAI in CDSS. Tabular data processing XAI-enabled systems are the most common, while XAI-enabled CDSS for text analysis are the least common in literature. There is more interest in developers for the provision of local explanations, while there was almost a balance between post-hoc and ante-hoc explanations, as well as between model-specific and model-agnostic techniques. Studies reported benefits of the use of XAI such as the fact that it could enhance decision confidence for clinicians, or generate the hypothesis about causality, which ultimately leads to increased trustworthiness and acceptability of the system and potential for its incorporation in the clinical workflow. However, we found an overall distinct lack of application of XAI in the context of CDSS and, in particular, a lack of user studies exploring the needs of clinicians. We propose some guidelines for the implementation of XAI in CDSS and explore some opportunities, challenges, and future research needs.},

  abstract = {The incidence, prevalence, and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) conditions have evolved over time, especially in countries that have varied social determinants of health. In most countries, diabetics and hypertension are the main causes of CKDs. The global guidelines classify CKD as a condition that results in decreased kidney function over time, as indicated by glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and markers of kidney damage. People with CKDs are likely to die at an early age. It is crucial for doctors to diagnose various conditions associated with CKD in an early stage because early detection may prevent or even reverse kidney damage. Early detection can provide better treatment and proper care to the patients. In many regional hospital/clinics, there is a shortage of nephrologists or general medical persons who diagnose the symptoms. This has resulted in patients waiting longer to get a diagnosis. Therefore, this research believes developing an intelligent system to classify a patient into classes of `CKD' or `Non-CKD' can help the doctors to deal with multiple patients and provide diagnosis faster. In time, organizations can implement the proposed machine learning framework in regional clinics that have lower medical expert retention, this can provide early diagnosis to patients in regional areas. Although, several researchers have tried to address the situation by developing intelligent systems using supervised machine learning methods, till date limited studies have used unsupervised machine learning algorithms. The primary aim of this research is to implement and compare the performance of various unsupervised algorithms and identify best possible combinations that can provide better accuracy and detection rate. This research has implemented five unsupervised algorithms, K-Means Clustering, DB-Scan, I-Forest, and Autoencoder. And integrating them with various feature selection methods. Integrating feature reduction methods with K-Means Clustering algorithm has achieved an overall accuracy of 99\% in classifying the clinical data of CKD and Non-CKD.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To compare the [18F]FDG PET/CT findings of untreated sarcoidosis and malignant lymphoma (ML) and develop convolutional neural network (CNN) models to differentiate between these diseases using maximum intensity projection (MIP) [18F]FDG PET images. METHODS: We retrospectively collected data on consecutive patients newly diagnosed with sarcoidosis and ML who underwent [18F]FDG PET/CT before treatment. Two nuclear radiologists reviewed the images. CNN models were created using MIP PET images and evaluated with k-fold cross-validation. The points of interest were visualized using gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM). RESULTS: A total of 56 patients with sarcoidosis and 62 patients with ML were included. Patients with sarcoidosis had more prominent FDG accumulation in the mediastinal lymph nodes and lung lesions, while those with ML had more prominent accumulation in the cervical lymph nodes (all p {$<$} 0.001). For the mediastinal lymph nodes, sarcoidosis patients had significant FDG accumulation in the level 2, 4, 7, and 10 lymph nodes (all p {$<$} 0.01). Otherwise, the accumulation in ML patients tended to be in the level 1 lymph nodes (p = 0.08). The CNN model using frontal and lateral MIP images achieved an average accuracy of 0.890 (95\% CI: 0.804-0.977), a sensitivity of 0.898 (95\% CI: 0.782-1.000), a specificity of 0.907 (95\% CI: 0.799-1.000), and an area under the curve of 0.963 (95\% CI: 0.899-1.000). Grad-CAM showed that the model focused on the sites of abnormal FDG accumulation. CONCLUSIONS: CNN models based on differences in FDG accumulation sites archive high performance in differentiating between sarcoidosis and ML. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: We developed a CNN model using MIP images of [18F]FDG PET/CT to distinguish between sarcoidosis and malignant lymphoma. It achieved high performance and could be useful in diagnosing diseases with involvement across organs and lymph nodes. KEY POINTS: {$\bullet$} There are differences in FDG distribution when comparing whole-body [18F]FDG PET/CT findings in patients with sarcoidosis and malignant lymphoma before treatment. {$\bullet$} Convolutional neural networks, a type of deep learning technique, trained with maximum-intensity projection PET images from two angles showed high performance. {$\bullet$} A deep learning model that utilizes differences in FDG distribution may be helpful in differentiating between diseases with lesions that are characteristically widespread among organs and lymph nodes.},

Deep learning approaches have shown promising performance as computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems, but their black-box behaviour hinders clinical application. We propose DR{\textbar}GRADUATE, a novel deep learning-based DR grading CAD system that supports its decision by providing a medically interpretable explanation and an estimation of how uncertain that prediction is, allowing the ophthalmologist to measure how much that decision should be trusted. We designed DR{\textbar}GRADUATE taking into account the ordinal nature of the DR grading problem. A novel Gaussian-sampling approach built upon a Multiple Instance Learning framework allow DR{\textbar}GRADUATE to infer an image grade associated with an explanation map and a prediction uncertainty while being trained only with image-wise labels. DR{\textbar}GRADUATE was trained on the Kaggle DR detection training set and evaluated across multiple datasets. In DR grading, a quadratic-weighted Cohen's kappa ({$\kappa$}) between 0.71 and 0.84 was achieved in five different datasets. We show that high {$\kappa$} values occur for images with low prediction uncertainty, thus indicating that this uncertainty is a valid measure of the predictions' quality. Further, bad quality images are generally associated with higher uncertainties, showing that images not suitable for diagnosis indeed lead to less trustworthy predictions. Additionally, tests on unfamiliar medical image data types suggest that DR{\textbar}GRADUATE allows outlier detection. The attention maps generally highlight regions of interest for diagnosis. These results show the great potential of DR{\textbar}GRADUATE as a second-opinion system in DR severity grading.},

One major barrier is the explainability dilemma and how much explanation is required to use artificial intelligence safely in healthcare. A key issue is the lack of consensus on the definition of explainability by experts, regulators, and healthcare professionals, resulting in a wide variety of terminology and expectations. This paper aims to fill the gap by defining minimal explainability standards to serve the views and needs of essential stakeholders in healthcare. In that sense, we propose to define minimal explainability criteria that can support doctors' understanding, meet patients' needs, and fulfill legal requirements. Therefore, explainability need not to be exhaustive but sufficient for doctors and patients to comprehend the artificial intelligence models' clinical implications and be integrated safely into clinical practice. Thus, minimally acceptable standards for explainability are context-dependent and should respond to the specific need and potential risks of each clinical scenario for a responsible and ethical implementation of artificial intelligence.},

  abstract = {The automatic construction of knowledge graphs (KGs) is an important research area in medicine, with far-reaching applications spanning drug discovery and clinical trial design. These applications hinge on the accurate identification of interactions among medical and biological entities. In this study, we propose an end-to-end machine learning solution based on large language models (LLMs) that utilize electronic medical record notes to construct KGs. The entities used in the KG construction process are diseases, factors, treatments, as well as manifestations that coexist with the patient while experiencing the disease. Given the critical need for high-quality performance in medical applications, we embark on a comprehensive assessment of 12 LLMs of various architectures, evaluating their performance and safety attributes. To gauge the quantitative efficacy of our approach by assessing both precision and recall, we manually annotate a dataset provided by the Macula and Retina Institute. We also assess the qualitative performance of LLMs, such as the ability to generate structured outputs or the tendency to hallucinate. The results illustrate that in contrast to encoder-only and encoder-decoder, decoder-only LLMs require further investigation. Additionally, we provide guided prompt design to utilize such LLMs. The application of the proposed methodology is demonstrated on age-related macular degeneration.},

  abstract = {Encoding whole slide images (WSI) as graphs is well motivated since it makes it possible for the gigapixel resolution WSI to be represented in its entirety for the purpose of graph learning. To this end, WSIs can be broken into smaller patches that represent the nodes of the graph. Then, graph-based learning methods can be utilized for the grading and classification of cancer. Message passing among neighboring nodes is the foundation of graph-based learning methods. However, they do not take into consideration any positional information for any of the patches, and if two patches are found in topologically isomorphic neighborhoods, their embeddings are nearly similar to one another. In this work, classification of cancer from WSIs is performed with positional embedding and graph attention. In order to represent the positional embedding of the nodes in graph classification, the proposed method makes use of spline convolutional neural networks (CNN). The algorithm is then tested with the WSI dataset for grading prostate cancer and kidney cancer. A comparison of the proposed method with leading approaches in cancer diagnosis and grading verify improved performance. The identification of cancerous regions in WSIs is another critical task in cancer diagnosis. In this work, the explainability of the proposed model is also addressed. A gradient-based explainbility approach is used to generate the saliency mapping for the WSIs. This can be used to look into regions of WSI that are responsible for cancer diagnosis thus rendering the proposed model explainable.},

Current methods use either explicit or implicit causal reasoning, yet there is a strong need for a unified approach combining both to tackle a wide array of causal relationships more effectively. This research proposes a novel architecture called Context Aware Reasoning Enhancement with Counterfactual Analysis(CARE CA) framework to enhance causal reasoning and explainability. The proposed framework incorporates an explicit causal detection module with ConceptNet and counterfactual statements, as well as implicit causal detection through LLMs. Our framework goes one step further with a layer of counterfactual explanations to accentuate LLMs understanding of causality. The knowledge from ConceptNet enhances the performance of multiple causal reasoning tasks such as causal discovery, causal identification and counterfactual reasoning. The counterfactual sentences add explicit knowledge of the not caused by scenarios. By combining these powerful modules, our model aims to provide a deeper understanding of causal relationships, enabling enhanced interpretability. Evaluation of benchmark datasets shows improved performance across all metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores. We also introduce CausalNet, a new dataset accompanied by our code, to facilitate further research in this domain.},

This is an important problem in the medical domain as collecting unbiased data is expensive and so learning from the wealth of existing biased data is a worthwhile task. Our approach separates the problem into two stages: first we reduce the bias by learning a representation map using a novel auto-encoder network---this allows us to control the trade-off between the bias-reduction and the information loss---and then we construct effective treatment policies on the transformed data using a novel feedforward network. Separation of the problem into these two stages creates an algorithm that can be adapted to the problem at hand---the bias-reduction step can be performed as a preprocessing step for other algorithms. We compare our algorithm against state-of-art algorithms on two semi-synthetic datasets and demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a significant improvement in performance.},

We introduce a methodology that allows to visualize the contributions of single pixels to predictions for kernel-based classifiers over Bag of Words features and for multilayered neural networks. These pixel contributions can be visualized as heatmaps and are provided to a human expert who can intuitively not only verify the validity of the classification decision, but also focus further analysis on regions of potential interest.

The advancement of this area is challenged by: 1) characterizing data distribution drift and its impacts on models, 2) expressiveness in tracking the model dynamics, and 3) theoretical guarantee on the performance. To address them, we propose a Temporal Domain Generalization with Drift-Aware Dynamic Neural Network (DRAIN) framework. Specifically, we formulate the problem into a Bayesian framework that jointly models the relation between data and model dynamics. We then build a recurrent graph generation scenario to characterize the dynamic graph-structured neural networks learned across different time points. It captures the temporal drift of model parameters and data distributions and can predict models in the future without the presence of future data. In addition, we explore theoretical guarantees of the model performance under the challenging temporal DG setting and provide theoretical analysis, including uncertainty and generalization error. Finally, extensive experiments on several real-world benchmarks with temporal drift demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.},

The use of differentially private learning algorithms in a "drop-in" fashion -- without accounting for the impact of differential privacy (DP) noise when choosing what feature engineering operations to use, what features to select, or what neural network architecture to use -- yields overly complex and poorly performing models. In other words, by anticipating the impact of DP noise, a simpler and more accurate alternative model could have been trained for the same privacy guarantee. We systematically study this phenomenon through theory and experiments. On the theory front, we provide an explanatory framework and prove that the phenomenon arises naturally from the addition of noise to satisfy differential privacy. On the experimental front, we demonstrate how the phenomenon manifests in practice using various datasets, types of models, tasks, and neural network architectures. We also analyze the factors that contribute to the problem and distill our experimental insights into concrete takeaways that practitioners can follow when training models with differential privacy. Finally, we propose privacy-aware algorithms for feature selection and neural network architecture search. We analyze their differential privacy properties and evaluate them empirically.},

This article treats a particular problem of generalizability, called "transportability", defined as a license to transfer information learned in experimental studies to a different population, on which only observational studies can be conducted. Given a set of assumptions concerning commonalities and differences between the two populations, Pearl and Bareinboim (2011) derived sufficient conditions that permit such transfer to take place. This article summarizes their findings and supplements them with an effective procedure for deciding when and how transportability is feasible. It establishes a necessary and sufficient condition for deciding when causal effects in the target population are estimable from both the statistical information available and the causal information transferred from the experiments. The article further provides a complete algorithm for computing the transport formula, that is, a way of combining observational and experimental information to synthesize bias-free estimate of the desired causal relation. Finally, the article examines the differences between transportability and other variants of generalizability.},

It is then enlightened by the recent neural causal model (NCM), a special type of SCM that is trainable, and design customized NCMs for GNNs. By training these GNN NCMs, the cause-effect can be easily calculated. 3) It uncovers the subgraph that causally explains the GNN predictions via the optimized GNN-NCMs. Evaluation results on multiple synthetic and real-world graphs validate that \{{\textbackslash}name\} significantly outperforms existing GNN explainers in exact groundtruth explanation identification},

The main objectives of this toolkit are to help facilitate the transition of fairness research algorithms to use in an industrial setting and to provide a common framework for fairness researchers to share and evaluate algorithms. The package includes a comprehensive set of fairness metrics for datasets and models, explanations for these metrics, and algorithms to mitigate bias in datasets and models. It also includes an interactive Web experience (https://aif360.mybluemix.net) that provides a gentle introduction to the concepts and capabilities for line-of-business users, as well as extensive documentation, usage guidance, and industry-specific tutorials to enable data scientists and practitioners to incorporate the most appropriate tool for their problem into their work products. The architecture of the package has been engineered to conform to a standard paradigm used in data science, thereby further improving usability for practitioners. Such architectural design and abstractions enable researchers and developers to extend the toolkit with their new algorithms and improvements, and to use it for performance benchmarking.

Currently, large-scale gene expression datasets from different conditions, cell types, disease states, and developmental time points are being collected. However, application of classical causal inference algorithms to infer gene regulatory networks based on such data is still challenging, requiring high sample sizes and computational resources. Here, we describe an algorithm that efficiently learns the differences in gene regulatory mechanisms between different conditions. Our difference causal inference (DCI) algorithm infers changes (i.e. edges that appeared, disappeared, or changed weight) between two causal graphs given gene expression data from the two conditions. This algorithm is efficient in its use of samples and computation since it infers the differences between causal graphs directly without estimating each possibly large causal graph separately. We provide a user-friendly Python implementation of DCI and also enable the user to learn the most robust difference causal graph across different tuning parameters via stability selection. Finally, we show how to apply DCI to single-cell RNA-seq data from different conditions and cell states, and we also validate our algorithm by predicting the effects of interventions.Python package freely available at http://uhlerlab.github.io/causaldag/dci.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Here, we describe an interpretable framework to explain the classifier's decisions. We show that functional genomic regions of various sizes are predominantly employed to distinguish between different tumor classes, ranging from enhancers and CpG islands to large-scale heterochromatic domains. We detect a high degree of genomic redundancy, with many genes distinguishing individual tumor classes, explaining the robustness of the classifier and revealing potential targets for further therapeutic investigation. We anticipate that our resource will build up trust in machine learning in clinical settings, foster biomarker discovery and development of compact point-of-care assays, and enable further epigenome research of brain tumors.

  abstract = {Causality has the potential to truly transform the way we solve a large number of real-world problems. Yet, so far, its potential largely remains to be unlocked as causality often requires crucial assumptions which cannot be tested in practice. To address this challenge, we propose a new way of thinking about causality -- we call this causal deep learning. Our causal deep learning framework spans three dimensions: (1) a structural dimension, which incorporates partial yet testable causal knowledge rather than assuming either complete or no causal knowledge among the variables of interest; (2) a parametric dimension, which encompasses parametric forms that capture the type of relationships among the variables of interest; and (3) a temporal dimension, which captures exposure times or how the variables of interest interact (possibly causally) over time. Causal deep learning enables us to make progress on a variety of real-world problems by leveraging partial causal knowledge (including independencies among variables) and quantitatively characterising causal relationships among variables of interest (possibly over time). Our framework clearly identifies which assumptions are testable and which ones are not, such that the resulting solutions can be judiciously adopted in practice. Using our formulation we can combine or chain together causal representations to solve specific problems without losing track of which assumptions are required to build these solutions, pushing real-world impact in healthcare, economics and business, environmental sciences and education, through causal deep learning.},

In this work, we focus on assessing how well those graphs capture dependencies seen in gene expression data to evaluate the adequacy of the prior knowledge provided by those graphs. We propose a condition graphs should satisfy to provide good prior knowledge and test it using `Single Gene Inference' tasks. We also compare with randomly generated graphs, aiming to measure the true benefit of using biologically relevant graphs in this context, and validate our findings with five clinical tasks. We find some graphs capture relevant dependencies for most genes while being very sparse. Our analysis with random graphs finds that dependencies can be captured almost as well at random which suggests that, in terms of gene expression levels, the relevant information about the state of the cell is spread across many genes.},

We find that, currently, the majority of deployments are not for end users affected by the model but rather for machine learning engineers, who use explainability to debug the model itself. There is thus a gap between explainability in practice and the goal of transparency, since explanations primarily serve internal stakeholders rather than external ones.

However, little research has compared the utility of different explanation methods in guiding healthcare experts for patient care. Moreover, it is unclear how useful, understandable, actionable and trustworthy these methods are for healthcare experts, as they often require technical ML knowledge. This paper presents an explanation dashboard that predicts the risk of diabetes onset and explains those predictions with data-centric, feature-importance, and example-based explanations. We designed an interactive dashboard to assist healthcare experts, such as nurses and physicians, in monitoring the risk of diabetes onset and recommending measures to minimize risk. We conducted a qualitative study with 11 healthcare experts and a mixed-methods study with 45 healthcare experts and 51 diabetic patients to compare the different explanation methods in our dashboard in terms of understandability, usefulness, actionability, and trust. Results indicate that our participants preferred our representation of data-centric explanations that provide local explanations with a global overview over other methods. Therefore, this paper highlights the importance of visually directive data-centric explanation method for assisting healthcare experts to gain actionable insights from patient health records. Furthermore, we share our design implications for tailoring the visual representation of different explanation methods for healthcare experts.},

  abstract = {Clinical decision making needs to be supported by evidence that treatments are beneficial to individual patients. Although randomized control trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for testing and introducing new drugs, due to the focus on specific questions with respect to establishing efficacy and safety vs. standard treatment, they do not provide a full characterization of the heterogeneity in the final intended treatment population. Conversely, real-world observational data, such as electronic health records (EHRs), contain large amounts of clinical information about heterogeneous patients and their response to treatments. In this paper, we introduce the main opportunities and challenges in using observational data for training machine learning methods to estimate individualized treatment effects and make treatment recommendations. We describe the modeling choices of the state-of-the-art machine learning methods for causal inference, developed for estimating treatment effects both in the cross-section and longitudinal settings. Additionally, we highlight future research directions that could lead to achieving the full potential of leveraging EHRs and machine learning for making individualized treatment recommendations. We also discuss how experimental data from RCTs and Pharmacometric and Quantitative Systems Pharmacology approaches can be used to not only improve machine learning methods, but also provide ways for validating them. These future research directions will require us to collaborate across the scientific disciplines to incorporate models based on RCTs and known disease processes, physiology, and pharmacology into these machine learning models based on EHRs to fully optimize the opportunity these data present.},

This paper presents the findings of a longitudinal multi-method study involving 112 developers and clinicians co-designing an XAI solution for a clinical decision support system.

Based on our findings, we propose design solutions that can help address the XAI conundrum in healthcare, including the use of causal inference models, personalized explanations, and ambidexterity between exploration and exploitation mindsets.

First, our approach allows for the robust detection of cancer cells and tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes in histological images, providing precise heatmap visualizations explaining the classifier decisions. Second, molecular features, including DNA methylation, gene expression, copy number variations, somatic mutations and proteins are predicted from histology. Molecular predictions reach balanced accuracies up to 78\%, whereas accuracies of over 95\% can be achieved for subgroups of patients. Finally, our explainable AI approach allows assessment of the link between morphological and molecular cancer properties. The resulting computational multiplex-histology analysis can help promote basic cancer research and precision medicine through an integrated diagnostic scoring of histological, clinical and molecular features.},

  abstract = {With rapid advances of deep neural networks over the past decade, artificial intelligence (AI) systems are now commonplace in many applications in biomedicine. These systems often achieve high predictive accuracy in clinical studies, and increasingly in clinical practice. Yet, despite their commonly high predictive accuracy, the trustworthiness of AI systems needs to be questioned when it comes to decision-making that affects the well-being of patients or the fairness towards patients or other stakeholders affected by AI-based decisions. To address this, the field of explainable artificial intelligence, or XAI for short, has emerged, seeking to provide means by which AI-based decisions can be explained to experts, users, or other stakeholders. While it is commonly claimed that explanations of artificial intelligence (AI) establish the trustworthiness of AI-based decisions, it remains unclear what traits of explanations cause them to foster trustworthiness. Building on historical cases of scientific explanation in medicine, we here propagate our perspective that, in order to foster trustworthiness, explanations in biomedical AI should meet the criteria of being scientific explanations. To further undermine our approach, we discuss its relation to the concepts of causality and randomized intervention. In our perspective, we combine aspects from the three disciplines of biomedicine, machine learning, and philosophy. From this interdisciplinary angle, we shed light on how the explanation and trustworthiness of artificial intelligence relate to the concepts of causality and robustness. To connect our perspective with AI research practice, we review recent cases of AI-based studies in pathology and, finally, provide guidelines on how to connect AI in biomedicine with scientific explanation.},

However, the network decisions are often perceived as being highly non-transparent, making it difficult to apply these algorithms in clinical routine. In this study, we propose using layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) to visualize convolutional neural network decisions for AD based on MRI data. Similarly to other visualization methods, LRP produces a heatmap in the input space indicating the importance/relevance of each voxel contributing to the final classification outcome. In contrast to susceptibility maps produced by guided backpropagation (``Which change in voxels would change the outcome most?''), the LRP method is able to directly highlight positive contributions to the network classification in the input space. In particular, we show that (1) the LRP method is very specific for individuals (``Why does this person have AD?'') with high inter-patient variability, (2) there is very little relevance for AD in healthy controls and (3) areas that exhibit a lot of relevance correlate well with what is known from literature. To quantify the latter, we compute size-corrected metrics of the summed relevance per brain area, e.g., relevance density or relevance gain. Although these metrics produce very individual ``fingerprints'' of relevance patterns for AD patients, a lot of importance is put on areas in the temporal lobe including the hippocampus. After discussing several limitations such as sensitivity toward the underlying model and computation parameters, we conclude that LRP might have a high potential to assist clinicians in explaining neural network decisions for diagnosing AD (and potentially other diseases) based on structural MRI data.},

Deep learning is a promising approach for phenotype prediction (clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response) based on gene expression profile. Existing deep learning models are usually considered as black-boxes that provide accurate predictions but are not interpretable. However, accuracy and interpretation are both essential for precision medicine. In addition, most models do not integrate the knowledge of the domain. Hence, making deep learning models interpretable for medical applications using prior biological knowledge is the main focus of this paper. RESULTS: In this paper, we propose a new self-explainable deep learning model, called Deep GONet, integrating the Gene Ontology into the hierarchical architecture of the neural network. This model is based on a fully-connected architecture constrained by the Gene Ontology annotations, such that each neuron represents a biological function. The experiments on cancer diagnosis datasets demonstrate that Deep GONet is both easily interpretable and highly performant to discriminate cancer and non-cancer samples. CONCLUSIONS: Our model provides an explanation to its predictions by identifying the most important neurons and associating them with biological functions, making the model understandable for biologists and physicians.},

In this study, we evaluate the ability of deep learning to predict response to HER2-targeted neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) from pre-treatment dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI acquired prior to treatment. In a retrospective study encompassing DCE-MRI data from a total of 157 HER2+ breast cancer patients from 5 institutions, we developed and validated a deep learning approach for predicting pathological complete response (pCR) to HER2-targeted NAC prior to treatment. 100 patients who received HER2-targeted neoadjuvant chemotherapy at a single institution were used to train (n=85) and tune (n=15) a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict pCR. A multi-input CNN leveraging both pre-contrast and late post-contrast DCE-MRI acquisitions was identified to achieve optimal response prediction within the validation set (AUC=0.93). This model was then tested on two independent testing cohorts with pre-treatment DCE-MRI data. It achieved strong performance in a 28 patient testing set from a second institution (AUC=0.85, 95\% CI 0.67-1.0, p=.0008) and a 29 patient multicenter trial including data from 3 additional institutions (AUC=0.77, 95\% CI 0.58-0.97, p=0.006). Deep learning-based response prediction model was found to exceed a multivariable model incorporating predictive clinical variables (AUC \&lt; .65 in testing cohorts) and a model of semi-quantitative DCE-MRI pharmacokinetic measurements (AUC \&lt; .60 in testing cohorts). The results presented in this work across multiple sites suggest that with further validation deep learning could provide an effective and reliable tool to guide targeted therapy in breast cancer, thus reducing overtreatment among HER2+ patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are statistically characterized within randomized clinical trials and postmarketing pharmacovigilance, but their molecular mechanism remains unknown in most cases. This is true even for hepatic or skin toxicities, which are classically monitored during drug design. Aside from clinical trials, many elements of knowledge about drug ingredients are available in open-access knowledge graphs, such as their properties, interactions, or involvements in pathways. In addition, drug classifications that label drugs as either causative or not for several ADRs, have been established. METHODS: We propose in this paper to mine knowledge graphs for identifying biomolecular features that may enable automatically reproducing expert classifications that distinguish drugs causative or not for a given type of ADR. In an Explainable AI perspective, we explore simple classification techniques such as Decision Trees and Classification Rules because they provide human-readable models, which explain the classification itself, but may also provide elements of explanation for molecular mechanisms behind ADRs. In summary, (1) we mine a knowledge graph for features; (2) we train classifiers at distinguishing, on the basis of extracted features, drugs associated or not with two commonly monitored ADRs: drug-induced liver injuries (DILI) and severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR); (3) we isolate features that are both efficient in reproducing expert classifications and interpretable by experts (i.e., Gene Ontology terms, drug targets, or pathway names); and (4) we manually evaluate in a mini-study how they may be explanatory. RESULTS: Extracted features reproduce with a good fidelity classifications of drugs causative or not for DILI and SCAR (Accuracy~=~0.74 and 0.81, respectively). Experts fully agreed that 73\% and 38\% of the most discriminative features are possibly explanatory for DILI and SCAR, respectively; and partially agreed (2/3) for 90\% and 77\% of them. CONCLUSION: Knowledge graphs provide sufficiently diverse features to enable simple and explainable models to distinguish between drugs that are causative or not for ADRs. In addition to explaining classifications, most discriminative features appear to be good candidates for investigating ADR mechanisms further.},

  abstract = {The monitoring of rotating machinery is an essential task in today's production processes. Currently, several machine learning and deep learning-based modules have achieved excellent results in fault detection and diagnosis. Nevertheless, to further increase user adoption and diffusion of such technologies, users and human experts must be provided with explanations and insights by the modules. Another issue is related, in most cases, with the unavailability of labeled historical data that makes the use of supervised models unfeasible. Therefore, a new approach for fault detection and diagnosis in rotating machinery is here proposed. The methodology consists of three parts: feature extraction, fault detection and fault diagnosis. In the first part, the vibration features in the time and frequency domains are extracted. Secondly, in the fault detection, the presence of fault is verified in an unsupervised manner based on anomaly detection algorithms. The modularity of the methodology allows different algorithms to be implemented. Finally, in fault diagnosis, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), a technique to interpret black-box models, is used. Through the feature importance ranking obtained by the model explainability, the fault diagnosis is performed. Two tools for diagnosis are proposed, namely: unsupervised classification and root cause analysis. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown on three datasets containing different mechanical faults in rotating machinery. The study also presents a comparison between models used in machine learning explainability: SHAP and Local Depth-based Feature Importance for the Isolation Forest (Local-DIFFI). Lastly, an analysis of several state-of-art anomaly detection algorithms in rotating machinery is included.},

The latest model developed by OpenAI, GPT-4, was trained using an unprecedented scale of compute and data. In this paper, we report on our investigation of an early version of GPT-4, when it was still in active development by OpenAI. We contend that (this early version of) GPT-4 is part of a new cohort of LLMs (along with ChatGPT and Google's PaLM for example) that exhibit more general intelligence than previous AI models. We discuss the rising capabilities and implications of these models. We demonstrate that, beyond its mastery of language, GPT-4 can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without needing any special prompting. Moreover, in all of these tasks, GPT-4's performance is strikingly close to human-level performance, and often vastly surpasses prior models such as ChatGPT. Given the breadth and depth of GPT-4's capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system. In our exploration of GPT-4, we put special emphasis on discovering its limitations, and we discuss the challenges ahead for advancing towards deeper and more comprehensive versions of AGI, including the possible need for pursuing a new paradigm that moves beyond next-word prediction. We conclude with reflections on societal influences of the recent technological leap and future research directions.},

By constructing a spatial cellular graph with immunohistology images and gene expression as node attributes, xSiGra employs hybrid graph transformer models to delineate spatial cell types. Additionally, xSiGra integrates a novel variant of gradient-weighted class activation mapping component to uncover interpretable features, including pivotal genes and cells for various cell types, thereby facilitating deeper biological insights from spatial data. Through rigorous benchmarking against existing methods, xSiGra demonstrates superior performance across diverse spatial imaging datasets. Application of xSiGra on a lung tumor slice unveils the importance score of cells, illustrating that cellular activity is not solely determined by itself but also impacted by neighboring cells.

With this in mind, we organized the PANDA challenge---the largest histopathology competition to date, joined by 1,290 developers---to catalyze development of reproducible AI algorithms for Gleason grading using 10,616 digitized prostate biopsies. We validated that a diverse set of submitted algorithms reached pathologist-level performance on independent cross-continental cohorts, fully blinded to the algorithm developers. On United States and European external validation sets, the algorithms achieved agreements of 0.862 (quadratically weighted {$\kappa$}, 95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.840--0.884) and 0.868 (95\% CI, 0.835--0.900) with expert uropathologists.

Here we leverage the theory of optimal transport and the recent advent of input convex neural architectures to present CellOT, a framework for learning the response of individual cells to a given perturbation by mapping these unpaired distributions. CellOT outperforms current methods at predicting single-cell drug responses, as profiled by scRNA-seq and a multiplexed protein-imaging technology. Further, we illustrate that CellOT generalizes well on unseen settings by (1) predicting the scRNA-seq responses of holdout patients with lupus exposed to interferon-{$\beta$} and patients with glioblastoma to panobinostat; (2) inferring lipopolysaccharide responses across different species; and (3) modeling the hematopoietic developmental trajectories of different subpopulations.},

We also highlight two broad and complementary perspectives for defining possible quality criteria for assessing explainability: epistemological and psychological (cognitive).

  abstract = {Omics methods are widely used in basic biology and translational medicine research. More and more omics data are collected to explain the impact of certain risk factors on clinical outcomes. To explain the mechanism of the risk factors, a core question is how to find the genes/proteins/metabolites that mediate their effects on the clinical outcome. Mediation analysis is a modeling framework to study the relationship between risk factors and pathological outcomes, via mediator variables. However, high-dimensional omics data are far more challenging than traditional data: (1) From tens of thousands of genes, can we overcome the curse of dimensionality to reliably select a set of mediators? (2) How do we ensure that the selected mediators are functionally consistent? (3) Many biological mechanisms contain nonlinear effects. How do we include nonlinear effects in the high-dimensional mediation analysis? (4) How do we consider multiple risk factors at the same time? To meet these challenges, we propose a new exploratory mediation analysis framework, medNet, which focuses on finding mediators through predictive modeling. We propose new definitions for predictive exposure, predictive mediator, and predictive network mediator, using a statistical hypothesis testing framework to identify predictive exposures and mediators. Additionally, two heuristic search algorithms are proposed to identify network mediators, essentially subnetworks in the genome-scale biological network that mediate the effects of single or multiple exposures. We applied medNet on a breast cancer data set and a metabolomics data set combined with food intake questionnaire data. It identified functionally consistent network mediators for the exposures' impact on the outcome, facilitating data interpretation.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) with deep learning models has been widely applied in numerous domains, including medical imaging and healthcare tasks. In the medical field, any judgment or decision is fraught with risk. A doctor will carefully judge whether a patient is sick before forming a reasonable explanation based on the patient's symptoms and/or an examination. Therefore, to be a viable and accepted tool, AI needs to mimic human judgment and interpretation skills. Specifically, explainable AI (XAI) aims to explain the information behind the black-box model of deep learning that reveals how the decisions are made. This paper provides a survey of the most recent XAI techniques used in healthcare and related medical imaging applications. We summarize and categorize the XAI types, and highlight the algorithms used to increase interpretability in medical imaging topics. In addition, we focus on the challenging XAI problems in medical applications and provide guidelines to develop better interpretations of deep learning models using XAI concepts in medical image and text analysis. Furthermore, this survey provides future directions to guide developers and researchers for future prospective investigations on clinical topics, particularly on applications with medical imaging.},

To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to report in detail how pathologists navigate WSIs of prostate cancer as they accumulate information for their diagnoses. We collected slide navigation data (i.e., viewport location, magnification level, and time) from 13 pathologists in 2 groups (5 genitourinary (GU) specialists and 8 general pathologists) and generated visual attention heatmaps and scanpaths. Each pathologist examined five WSIs from the TCGA PRAD dataset, which were selected by a GU pathology specialist. We examined and analyzed the distributions of visual attention for each group of pathologists after each WSI was examined. To quantify the relationship between a pathologist's attention and evidence for cancer in the WSI, we obtained tumor annotations from a genitourinary specialist. We used these annotations to compute the overlap between the distribution of visual attention and annotated tumor region to identify strong correlations. Motivated by this analysis, we trained a deep learning model to predict visual attention on unseen WSIs. We find that the attention heatmaps predicted by our model correlate quite well with the ground truth attention heatmap and tumor annotations on a test set of 17 WSIs by using various spatial and temporal evaluation metrics.},

Building upon previous research, we introduce an XAI system that provides precise and domain-specific explanations alongside its differential diagnoses of melanomas and nevi. Through a three-phase study, we assess its impact on dermatologists' diagnostic accuracy, diagnostic confidence, and trust in the XAI-support. Our results show strong alignment between XAI and dermatologist explanations. We also show that dermatologists' confidence in their diagnoses, and their trust in the support system significantly increase with XAI compared to conventional AI.

  abstract = {Metformin, an antidiabetic drug, triggers anti-aging cellular responses. Aging is the principal risk factor for dementia, but previous observational studies of the diabetes drugs metformin vs. sulfonylureas have been mixed. We tested the hypotheses that metformin improves survival and reduces the risk of dementia, relative to the sulfonylureas, by emulating target trials in electronic health records of diabetic patients at an academic-centered healthcare system in the US and a wide-ranging group of primary care practices in the UK. To address metformin's potentially dual influences on dementia risk---that it might reduce the hazard of death and put more people at risk of developing dementia while reducing the hazard of dementia by slowing biological aging, we used a competing risks approach and carefully grounded that within a causal inference emulated trial framework. To identify candidate biomarkers of metformin's actions in the brain that might mediate reduced dementia risk, we conducted an in-vitro systems pharmacology evaluation of metformin and glyburide on differentiated human neural cells through differential gene expression. We named our multi-dimensional approach DRIAD-EHR (Drug Repurposing in Alzheimer's Disease-Electronic Health Records). In intention-to-treat analyses, metformin was associated with a lower hazard of all-cause mortality than sulfonylureas in both cohorts. In competing risks analyses, there was also a lower cause-specific hazard of dementia onset among metformin initiators. In in-vitro studies, metformin reduced human neural cell expression of SPP1 and APOE, two secreted proteins that have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis and whose levels can be quantified in the CSF. Together, our findings suggest that metformin might prevent dementia in patients without type II diabetes. In addition, our results inform the design of clinical trials of metformin in non-diabetics and suggest a pharmacodynamic CSF biomarker, SPP1, for metformin's action in the brain.},

However, these deep models are perceived as "black box" methods considering the lack of understanding of their internal functioning. There has been a significant recent interest in developing explainable deep learning models, and this paper is an effort in this direction. Building on a recently proposed method called Grad-CAM, we propose a generalized method called Grad-CAM++ that can provide better visual explanations of CNN model predictions, in terms of better object localization as well as explaining occurrences of multiple object instances in a single image, when compared to state-of-the-art. We provide a mathematical derivation for the proposed method, which uses a weighted combination of the positive partial derivatives of the last convolutional layer feature maps with respect to a specific class score as weights to generate a visual explanation for the corresponding class label. Our extensive experiments and evaluations, both subjective and objective, on standard datasets showed that Grad-CAM++ provides promising human-interpretable visual explanations for a given CNN architecture across multiple tasks including classification, image caption generation and 3D action recognition; as well as in new settings such as knowledge distillation.},

  abstract = {Since 2001, cardiovascular disease (CVD) has had the second-highest mortality rate, about 15,700 people per year, in Taiwan. It has thus imposed a substantial burden on medical resources. This study was triggered by the following three factors. First, the CVD problem reflects an urgent issue. A high priority has been placed on long-term therapy and prevention to reduce the wastage of medical resources, particularly in developed countries. Second, from the perspective of preventive medicine, popular data-mining methods have been well learned and studied, with excellent performance in medical fields. Thus, identification of the risk factors of CVD using these popular techniques is a prime concern. Third, the Framingham risk score is a core indicator that can be used to establish an effective prediction model to accurately diagnose CVD. Thus, this study proposes an integrated predictive model to organize five notable classifiers: the rough set (RS), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and support vector machine (SVM), with a novel use of the Framingham risk score for attribute selection (i.e., F-attributes first identified in this study) to determine the key features for identifying CVD. Verification experiments were conducted with three evaluation criteria---accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity---based on 1190 instances of a CVD dataset available from a Taiwan teaching hospital and 2019 examples from a public Framingham dataset. Given the empirical results, the SVM showed the best performance in terms of accuracy (99.67\%), sensitivity (99.93\%), and specificity (99.71\%) in all F-attributes in the CVD dataset compared to the other listed classifiers. The RS showed the highest performance in terms of accuracy (85.11\%), sensitivity (86.06\%), and specificity (85.19\%) in most of the F-attributes in the Framingham dataset. The above study results support novel evidence that no classifier or model is suitable for all practical datasets of medical applications. Thus, identifying an appropriate classifier to address specific medical data is important. Significantly, this study is novel in its calculation and identification of the use of key Framingham risk attributes integrated with the DT technique to produce entropy-based decision rules of knowledge sets, which has not been undertaken in previous research. This study conclusively yielded meaningful entropy-based knowledgeable rules in tree structures and contributed to the differentiation of classifiers from the two datasets with three useful research findings and three helpful management implications for subsequent medical research. In particular, these rules provide reasonable solutions to simplify processes of preventive medicine by standardizing the formats and codes used in medical data to address CVD problems. The specificity of these rules is thus significant compared to those of past research.},

In recent years, with the development of Artificial Intelligence(AI) and the accumulation of medical data, AI has begun to be deeply integrated with mammography, MRI, ultrasound, etc. to assist physicians in disease diagnosis. However, the existing breast cancer diagnosis model based on Computer Vision(CV) is greatly affected by the image quality; on the other hand, the breast cancer diagnosis model based on Natural Language Processing(NLP) cannot effectively extract the semantic information of the mammography report. The lack of model interpretability also makes the existing diagnostic models have low confidence. In this paper, we proposed Breast Cancer Causal XAI Diagnostic Model(BCCXDM). Specifically, we first structured the mammography report. Then find the causal graph based on the structured table. We combine the existing tabular learning method TabNet with causal graphs(Causal-TabNet) to enable reasoning in the graphs to preserve the correlation between features. More importantly, we use GNN and node transition probability to aggregate node information. We evaluate our model on the real-world mammography report, and compare it with other popular interpretable methods. The experimental results show that our interpretable results are closer to the diagnostic criteria of clinicians.},

  abstract = {Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Conventional cancer treatment relies on radiotherapy and chemotherapy, but both methods bring severe side effects to patients, as these therapies not only attack cancer cells but also damage normal cells. Anticancer peptides (ACPs) are a promising alternative as therapeutic agents that are efficient and selective against tumor cells. Here, we propose a deep learning method based on convolutional neural networks to predict biological activity (EC50, LC50, IC50, and LD50) against six tumor cells, including breast, colon, cervix, lung, skin, and prostate. We show that models derived with multitask learning achieve better performance than conventional single-task models. In repeated 5-fold cross validation using the CancerPPD data set, the best models with the applicability domain defined obtain an average mean squared error of 0.1758, Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.8086, and Kendall's correlation coefficient of 0.6156. As a step toward model interpretability, we infer the contribution of each residue in the sequence to the predicted activity by means of feature importance weights derived from the convolutional layers of the model. The present method, referred to as xDeep-AcPEP, will help to identify effective ACPs in rational peptide design for therapeutic purposes. The data, script files for reproducing the experiments, and the final prediction models can be downloaded from http://github.com/chen709847237/xDeep-AcPEP.

  abstract = {Feature attributions based on the Shapley value are popular for explaining machine learning models; however, their estimation is complex from both a theoretical and computational standpoint. We disentangle this complexity into two factors: (1){\textasciitilde}the approach to removing feature information, and (2){\textasciitilde}the tractable estimation strategy. These two factors provide a natural lens through which we can better understand and compare 24 distinct algorithms. Based on the various feature removal approaches, we describe the multiple types of Shapley value feature attributions and methods to calculate each one. Then, based on the tractable estimation strategies, we characterize two distinct families of approaches: model-agnostic and model-specific approximations. For the model-agnostic approximations, we benchmark a wide class of estimation approaches and tie them to alternative yet equivalent characterizations of the Shapley value. For the model-specific approximations, we clarify the assumptions crucial to each method's tractability for linear, tree, and deep models. Finally, we identify gaps in the literature and promising future research directions.},

  abstract = {Transparency in Machine Learning (ML), often also referred to as interpretability or explainability, attempts to reveal the working mechanisms of complex models. From a human-centered design perspective, transparency is not a property of the ML model but an affordance, i.e., a relationship between algorithm and users. Thus, prototyping and user evaluations are critical to attaining solutions that afford transparency. Following human-centered design principles in highly specialized and high stakes domains, such as medical image analysis, is challenging due to the limited access to end users and the knowledge imbalance between those users and ML designers. To investigate the state of transparent ML in medical image analysis, we conducted a systematic review of the literature from 2012 to 2021 in PubMed, EMBASE, and Compendex databases. We identified 2508 records and 68 articles met the inclusion criteria. Current techniques in transparent ML are dominated by computational feasibility and barely consider end users, e.g. clinical stakeholders. Despite the different roles and knowledge of ML developers and end users, no study reported formative user research to inform the design and development of transparent ML models. Only a few studies validated transparency claims through empirical user evaluations. These shortcomings put contemporary research on transparent ML at risk of being incomprehensible to users, and thus, clinically irrelevant. To alleviate these shortcomings in forthcoming research, we introduce the INTRPRT guideline, a design directive for transparent ML systems in medical image analysis. The INTRPRT guideline suggests human-centered design principles, recommending formative user research as the first step to understand user needs and domain requirements. Following these guidelines increases the likelihood that the algorithms afford transparency and enable stakeholders to capitalize on the benefits of transparent ML.},

  abstract = {Ever since Granger first proposed the idea of quantitatively testing the causal relationship between data streams, the endeavor of accurately inferring the causality in data and using that information to predict the future has not stopped. Artificial Intelligence (AI), by utilizing the massive amounts of data, helps to solve complex problems, whether they include the diagnosis and detection of disease through medical imaging, email spam detection, or self-driving vehicles. Perhaps, this thesis will be trivial in ten years from now. AI has pushed humankind to reach the next technological level in technology. Nowadays, among most machine leaning inquiries, statistical relationships are determined using correlation measures. By feeding data into machine learning algorithms, computers update the algorithm's parameters iteratively by extracting and mapping features to learning targets until the correlation increases to a significant level to cease the training process. However, with the increasing developments of powerful AI, there is really a shortage of exploring causality in data. It is almost self-evident that ''correlation is not causality." Sometimes, the strong correlation established between variables through machine learning can be absurd and meaningless. Providing insight into causality information through data, which most of the machine learning methods fall short to do, is of paramount importance. The subsequent chapters detail the four endeavors of studying causality in financial markets, earthquakes, animal/human brain signals, the predictivity of data sets. In Chapter 2, we further developed the concept of causality networks into a higher-order causality network. We applied these to financial data and tested their validity and ability to capture the system's causal relationship. In next Chapter 3, We examined another type of time series-earthquakes. Violent seismic activities decimate people's lives and destroy entire cities and areas. This begs us to understand how earthquakes work and help us make reliably and evacuation-actionable predictions. The causal relationships of seismic activities in different areas are studied and established. Biological data, specifically brain signals, are time-series data and their causal pattern are explored and studied. Different human and mice brain signals are analyzed and clustered in Chapter 4 using their unique causal pattern to understand different brain cell activity. Finally, we realized that the causal pattern in the time series can be used to compress data. A causal compression ratio is invented and used as the data stream's predictivity index. We describe this in Chapter 5.},

  abstract = {In modern medicine, medical imaging technologies such as computed tomography (CT), X-ray, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), nuclear medicine, etc., have been proven to provide useful diagnostic information by displaying areas of a lesion or tumor not visible to the human eye, and may also help provide additional recessive information by using modern data analysis methods. These methods, including Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, are based on deep learning architectures, and have shown remarkable results in recent studies. However, the lack of explanatory ability of connection-based, instead of algorithm-based, deep learning technologies is one of the main reasons for the delay in the acceptance of these technologies in the mainstream medical field. One of the recent methods that may offer the explanatory ability for the CNN classes of deep learning neural networks is the gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) method, which produces heat-maps that may offer explanations of the classification results. There are already many studies in the literature that compare the objective metrics of Grad-CAM-generated heat-maps against other methods. However, the subjective evaluation of AI-based classification/prediction results using medical images by qualified personnel could potentially contribute more to the acceptance of AI than objective metrics. The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether and how the Grad-CAM heat-maps can help physicians and radiologists in making diagnoses by presenting the results from AI-based classifications as well as their associated Grad-CAM-generated heat-maps to a qualified radiologist. The results of this study show that the radiologist considers Grad-CAM-generated heat-maps to be generally helpful toward diagnosis.},

  abstract = {Deep learning models have achieved high performance across different domains, such as medical decision-making, autonomous vehicles, decision support systems, among many others. However, despite this success, the inner mechanisms of these models are opaque because their internal representations are too complex for a human to understand. This opacity makes it hard to understand the how or the why of the predictions of deep learning models. There has been a growing interest in model-agnostic methods that make deep learning models more transparent and explainable to humans. Some researchers recently argued that for a machine to achieve human-level explainability, this machine needs to provide human causally understandable explanations, also known as causability. A specific class of algorithms that have the potential to provide causability are counterfactuals. This paper presents an in-depth systematic review of the diverse existing literature on counterfactuals and causability for explainable artificial intelligence (AI). We performed a Latent Dirichlet topic modelling analysis (LDA) under a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework to find the most relevant literature articles. This analysis yielded a novel taxonomy that considers the grounding theories of the surveyed algorithms, together with their underlying properties and applications to real-world data. Our research suggests that current model-agnostic counterfactual algorithms for explainable AI are not grounded on a causal theoretical formalism and, consequently, cannot promote causability to a human decision-maker. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the explanations derived from popular algorithms in the literature provide spurious correlations rather than cause/effects relationships, leading to sub-optimal, erroneous, or even biased explanations. Thus, this paper also advances the literature with new directions and challenges on promoting causability in model-agnostic approaches for explainable AI.},

Recent research efforts suggest that attention maps, which are part of decision-making process of ViTs can potentially address the explainability issue by identifying regions influencing predictions, especially in models pretrained with self-supervised learning. In this work, we compare the visual explanations of attention maps to other commonly used methods for medical imaging problems. To do so, we employ four distinct medical imaging datasets that involve the identification of (1) colonic polyps, (2) breast tumors, (3) esophageal inflammation, and (4) bone fractures and hardware implants. Through large-scale experiments on the aforementioned datasets using various supervised and self-supervised pretrained ViTs, we find that although attention maps show promise under certain conditions and generally surpass GradCAM in explainability, they are outperformed by transformer-specific interpretability methods. Our findings indicate that the efficacy of attention maps as a method of interpretability is context-dependent and may be limited as they do not consistently provide the comprehensive insights required for robust medical decision-making.},

Healthcare institutions are establishing frameworks to govern and promote the implementation of accurate, actionable and reliable models that integrate with clinical workflow. Such governance frameworks require an accompanying technical framework to deploy models in a resource efficient manner. Here we present DEPLOYR, a technical framework for enabling real-time deployment and monitoring of researcher created clinical ML models into a widely used electronic medical record (EMR) system. We discuss core functionality and design decisions, including mechanisms to trigger inference based on actions within EMR software, modules that collect real-time data to make inferences, mechanisms that close-the-loop by displaying inferences back to end-users within their workflow, monitoring modules that track performance of deployed models over time, silent deployment capabilities, and mechanisms to prospectively evaluate a deployed model's impact. We demonstrate the use of DEPLOYR by silently deploying and prospectively evaluating twelve ML models triggered by clinician button-clicks in Stanford Health Care's production instance of Epic. Our study highlights the need and feasibility for such silent deployment, because prospectively measured performance varies from retrospective estimates. By describing DEPLOYR, we aim to inform ML deployment best practices and help bridge the model implementation gap.},

This study presents XplainLungSHAP, a novel framework combining SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and attention mechanisms to enhance both predictive accuracy and transparency. The aim is to support clinicians in preoperative evaluations by identifying and prioritizing key clinical features. Methods: The framework was developed using data from 470 patients undergoing lung cancer surgery. Key clinical features were identified through SHAP, ensuring alignment with medical expertise. These features were dynamically weighted using an attention mechanism in a neural network, enhancing their impact on survival predictions. The model's performance was evaluated through accuracy, confusion matrices, and ROC analysis, demonstrating its reliability and interpretability. Results: The XplainLungSHAP model achieved an accuracy of 91.49\%, outperforming traditional machine learning models. SHAP analysis identified critical predictors, including pulmonary function, comorbidities, and age, while the attention mechanism prioritized these features dynamically. The combined approach ensured high accuracy and offered actionable insights into survival predictions. Conclusions: XplainLungSHAP addresses the limitations of black-box models by integrating explainability with state-of-the-art predictive techniques.

Gene expression data from RNA-seq, extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), were used to train ML models, including decision trees (DTs), random forest (RF), and XGBoost (XGB), which achieved accuracies of 98.69\%, 99.82\%, and 99.37\%, respectively. However, the challenges in this analysis included the high dimensionality of the dataset and the lack of transparency in the ML models. To mitigate these challenges, the SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) method was applied to generate a list of features, aiming to understand which characteristics influenced the models' decision-making processes and, consequently, the prediction results for the five tumor types. The SHAP analysis identified 119, 80, and 10 genes for the RF, XGB, and DT models, respectively, totaling 209 genes, resulting in 172 unique genes. The new list, representing 0.8\% of the original input features, is coherent and fully explainable, increasing confidence in the applied models. Additionally, the results suggest that the SHAP method can be effectively used as a feature selector in gene expression data. This approach not only enhances model transparency but also maintains high classification performance, highlighting its potential in identifying biologically relevant features that may serve as biomarkers for cancer diagnostics and treatment planning.},

Most NeSy systems rely on continuous relaxation of logical knowledge, and no discrete decisions are made within the model pipeline. Furthermore, these methods assume that the symbolic rules are given. In this paper, we propose Deep Symboilic Learning (DSL), a NeSy system that learns NeSy-functions, i.e., the composition of a (set of) perception functions which map continuous data to discrete symbols, and a symbolic function over the set of symbols. DSL simultaneously learns the perception and symbolic functions while being trained only on their composition (NeSy-function). The key novelty of DSL is that it can create internal (interpretable) symbolic representations and map them to perception inputs within a differentiable NN learning pipeline. The created symbols are automatically selected to generate symbolic functions that best explain the data. We provide experimental analysis to substantiate the efficacy of DSL  in simultaneously learning perception and symbolic functions.},

However, the black-box nature of deep neural networks challenges its use in mission critical applications, raising ethical and judicial concerns inducing lack of trust. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that promotes a set of tools, techniques, and algorithms that can generate high-quality interpretable, intuitive, human-understandable explanations of AI decisions. In addition to providing a holistic view of the current XAI landscape in deep learning, this paper provides mathematical summaries of seminal work. We start by proposing a taxonomy and categorizing the XAI techniques based on their scope of explanations, methodology behind the algorithms, and explanation level or usage which helps build trustworthy, interpretable, and self-explanatory deep learning models. We then describe the main principles used in XAI research and present the historical timeline for landmark studies in XAI from 2007 to 2020. After explaining each category of algorithms and approaches in detail, we then evaluate the explanation maps generated by eight XAI algorithms on image data, discuss the limitations of this approach, and provide potential future directions to improve XAI evaluation.},

DeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrates remarkable reasoning capabilities. Through RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerges with numerous powerful and intriguing reasoning behaviors. However, it encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates multi-stage training and cold-start data before RL. DeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1-1217 on reasoning tasks. To support the research community, we open-source DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models (1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, 70B) distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Qwen and Llama.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) researchers and radiologists have recently reported AI systems that accurately detect COVID-19 in chest radiographs. However, the robustness of these systems remains unclear. Using state-of-the-art techniques in explainable AI, we demonstrate that recent deep learning systems to detect COVID-19 from chest radiographs rely on confounding factors rather than medical pathology, creating an alarming situation in which the systems appear accurate, but fail when tested in new hospitals. We observe that the approach to obtain training data for these AI systems introduces a nearly ideal scenario for AI to learn these spurious `shortcuts'. Because this approach to data collection has also been used to obtain training data for the detection of COVID-19 in computed tomography scans and for medical imaging tasks related to other diseases, our study reveals a far-reaching problem in medical-imaging AI. In addition, we show that evaluation of a model on external data is insufficient to ensure AI systems rely on medically relevant pathology, because the undesired `shortcuts' learned by AI systems may not impair performance in new hospitals. These findings demonstrate that explainable AI should be seen as a prerequisite to clinical deployment of machine-learning healthcare models.},

Our method leverages {$>$}1.6 million annotations from board-certified pathologists across {$>$}5700 samples to train deep learning models for cell and tissue classification that can exhaustively map whole-slide images at two and four micron-resolution. Cell- and tissue-type model outputs are combined into 607 HIFs that quantify specific and biologically-relevant characteristics across five cancer types. We demonstrate that these HIFs correlate with well-known markers of the tumor microenvironment and can predict diverse molecular signatures (AUROC 0.601--0.864), including expression of four immune checkpoint proteins and homologous recombination deficiency, with performance comparable to `black-box' methods. Our HIF-based approach provides a comprehensive, quantitative, and interpretable window into the composition and spatial architecture of the tumor microenvironment.},

We leverage this insight to implement a new tool, CIMLA, for discovering condition-dependent changes in causal relationships. We then use CIMLA to identify differences in gene regulatory networks between biological conditions, a problem that has received great attention in recent years. Using extensive benchmarking on simulated data sets, we show that CIMLA is more robust to confounding variables and is more accurate than leading methods. Finally, we employ CIMLA to analyze a previously published single-cell RNA-seq data set collected from subjects with and without Alzheimer's disease (AD), discovering several potential regulators of AD.},

  abstract = {Nowadays Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a fundamental component of healthcare applications, both clinical and remote, but the best performing AI systems are often too complex to be self-explaining. Explainable AI (XAI) techniques are defined to unveil the reasoning behind the system's predictions and decisions, and they become even more critical when dealing with sensitive and personal health data. It is worth noting that XAI has not gathered the same attention across different research areas and data types, especially in healthcare. In particular, many clinical and remote health applications are based on tabular and time series data, respectively, and XAI is not commonly analysed on these data types, while computer vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) are the reference applications. To provide an overview of XAI methods that are most suitable for tabular and time series data in the healthcare domain, this paper provides a review of the literature in the last 5 years, illustrating the type of generated explanations and the efforts provided to evaluate their relevance and quality. Specifically, we identify clinical validation, consistency assessment, objective and standardised quality evaluation, and human-centered quality assessment as key features to ensure effective explanations for the end users. Finally, we highlight the main research challenges in the field as well as the limitations of existing XAI methods.},

It is an even more prevalent health problem in low- and middle-income countries demanding costly treatment and management. This study proposes an explainable artificial intelligence-based approach towards mortality prediction for patients with sepsis admitted to intensive care unit (ICU).                                         Methods                                A total of 500 patients (                 N                 \,=\,500, male: female\,=\,262:238, age\,=\,45.96\,{\textpm}\,20.92~years) with sepsis were analyzed retrospectively. We utilize SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method to gain insights into the preliminary model's learnings regarding the wide array of demographic, clinical, radiological, and laboratory features. The clinical insights were used for feature selection to fetch the top                 t                 \,=\,80\% feature spread as well as to derive empirical findings from feature dependence plots which could find application in periphery hospital settings. Four machine learning algorithms, Random Forest, XGBoost, Extra Trees and Gradient Boosting classifiers were trained for the binary classification task (discharge from ICU and death in ICU) with the selected influential feature set.                                                        Results               The Extra Trees Classifier showed the best overall performance with AUROC score: 0.87 (95\% CI 0.80--0.93), Accuracy: 0.79 (95\% CI 0.71--0.86), F1 score: 0.78 (95\% CI 0.69--0.86), Precision: 0.88 (95\% CI 0.78--0.98) and Recall: 0.70 (95\% CI 0.57--0.82). All four models perform significantly well on dataset with AUROC scores ranging from 0.81 (CI 0.73--0.89) to 0.87 (CI 0.80--0.93) and F1 scores ranging 0.74 (CI 0.64--0.83) to 0.78 (CI 0.69--0.86) on the hold-out test set and were stable over fivefold cross-validation prior to testing.                                         Conclusions               The proposed approach could provide preemptive estimations into prognostication and outcome prediction of patients with sepsis in low-resource settings. This will aid in clinical decision-making, resource allocation and research for new treatment modalities.},

  abstract = {Hypertension, a common and complex cardiovascular disease associated with a high risk of mortality and morbidity, has been targeted for detection using Artificial Intelligence Methods in recent times. However, due to their black-box nature, the reasons behind hypertension could not be identified by doctors. Therefore, there is an urgent need to elucidate the connections between hypertension and other biomarkers. In this study, local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were employed to demystify the hypertension risk prediction made by an extreme gradient boost (XGBoost) model. A comprehensive case record of 623 patients, encompassing reported hypertension and other diseases, medication usage, and laboratory results for 13 critical biomarkers, was analyzed in our study. The exemplary performance of our XGBoost model, demonstrating an accuracy of 99.4\%, precision of 100\%, recall of 97.30\%, and an F1-score of 98.6\%, further confirms the potential of Machine Learning (ML) in healthcare. Furthermore, the Biogeography-Based Optimization (BBO) algorithm was utilized to identify an effective subset of features. Almost half of the initial features were selected by the BBO algorithm. Achieving an accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of 97.7\%, 96.9\%, 93.9\%, and 95.4\%, respectively, using only 14 features selected by BBO highlights its efficacy. Additionally, our study demonstrated the impact of features on ML models through LIME and SHAP analyses. The preliminary system developed in this study underscores advanced, interpretable predictive modeling for early hypertension detection, laying the groundwork for enhanced risk assessment in diagnosis and preventive medicine in the future.},

The models were trained on data from 10,038\,patients (48\% women), and their performance was externally validated using data from 10,286\,patients (35\% women) from seven cohorts. CoDE-ACS had excellent discrimination for myocardial infarction (area under curve, 0.953; 95\% confidence interval, 0.947--0.958), performed well across subgroups and identified more patients at presentation as low probability of having myocardial infarction than fixed cardiac troponin thresholds (61 versus 27\%) with a similar negative predictive value and fewer as high probability of having myocardial infarction (10 versus 16\%) with a greater positive predictive value. Patients identified as having a low probability of myocardial infarction had a lower rate of cardiac death than those with intermediate or high probability 30\,days (0.1 versus 0.5 and 1.8\%) and 1\,year (0.3 versus 2.8 and 4.2\%; P\,{$<$}\,0.001 for both) from patient presentation.

However, existing works simply cascade the two components together and optimize them isolatedly, failing to utilize the mutual enhancing information between them. To address this problem, we propose DeepLogic, a framework with joint learning of neural perception and logical reasoning, such that these two components are jointly optimized through mutual supervision signals. In particular, the proposed DeepLogic framework contains a deep-logic module that is capable of representing complex first-order-logic formulas in a tree structure with basic logic operators. We then theoretically quantify the mutual supervision signals and propose the deep\&logic optimization algorithm for joint optimization. We further prove the convergence of DeepLogic and conduct extensive experiments on model performance, convergence, and generalization, as well as its extension to the continuous domain. The experimental results show that through jointly learning both perceptual ability and logic formulas in a weakly supervised manner, our proposed DeepLogic framework can significantly outperform DNN-based baselines by a great margin and beat other strong baselines without out-of-box tools.},

  abstract = {The healthcare sector has advanced significantly as a result of the ability of artificial intelligence (AI) to solve cognitive problems that once required human intelligence. As artificial intelligence finds more applications in healthcare, trustworthiness must be guaranteed. Even while AI has the potential to improve healthcare, there are still challenging issues because it is yet to be widely adopted, especially when it comes to transparency. Concerns about comprehending the internal workings of AI models, possible biases, model robustness, and generalizability are raised by their opacity which makes them function like black boxes. A solution for worries over the transparency of AI algorithms is explainable AI. Explainable AI seeks to enhance AI explainability and analytical capabilities, particularly in vital industries like healthcare.~Even though earlier research has examined several explainable AI-related topics, such as a lexicon, industry-specific overviews, and applications in the healthcare industry, a thorough analysis concentrating on the function of explainable AI in building trust in AI healthcare systems is required. In an effort to close this gap, a systematic literature review that adheres to PRISMA principles that analyze relevant~papers that were published between 2015 and 2023 was done in this paper. To determine the critical role that explainable AI plays in fostering trust, this study examines widely utilized methodologies, machine learning and deep learning techniques, datasets, performance measures and validation procedures used in AI healthcare research. In addition, research issues and potential research directions are also discussed in this research. Thus, this systematic review provides a thorough summary of the present status of research on explainability and transparency in AI healthcare systems, thus illuminating crucial factors that affect user trust. The results are intended to assist researchers, policymakers and healthcare professionals in developing a more transparent, responsible and reliable AI system in the healthcare sector.},

  abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia. Its diagnosis and progression detection have been intensively studied. Nevertheless, research studies often have little effect on clinical practice mainly due to the following reasons: (1) Most studies depend mainly on a single modality, especially neuroimaging; (2) diagnosis and progression detection are usually studied separately as two independent problems; and (3) current studies concentrate mainly on optimizing the performance of complex machine learning models, while disregarding their explainability. As a result, physicians struggle to interpret these models, and feel it is hard to trust them. In this paper, we carefully develop an accurate and interpretable AD diagnosis and progression detection model. This model provides physicians with accurate decisions along with a set of explanations for every decision. Specifically, the model integrates 11 modalities of 1048 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) real-world dataset: 294 cognitively normal, 254 stable mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 232 progressive MCI, and 268 AD. It is actually a two-layer model with random forest (RF) as classifier algorithm. In the first layer, the model carries out a multi-class classification for the early diagnosis of AD patients. In the second layer, the model applies binary classification to detect possible MCI-to-AD progression within three years from a baseline diagnosis. The performance of the model is optimized with key markers selected from a large set of biological and clinical measures. Regarding explainability, we provide, for each layer, global and instance-based explanations of the RF classifier by using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) feature attribution framework. In addition, we implement 22 explainers based on decision trees and fuzzy rule-based systems to provide complementary justifications for every RF decision in each layer. Furthermore, these explanations are represented in natural language form to help physicians understand the predictions. The designed model achieves a cross-validation accuracy of 93.95\% and an F1-score of 93.94\% in the first layer, while it achieves a cross-validation accuracy of 87.08\% and an F1-Score of 87.09\% in the second layer. The resulting system is not only accurate, but also trustworthy, accountable, and medically applicable, thanks to the provided explanations which are broadly consistent with each other and with the AD medical literature. The proposed system can help to enhance the clinical understanding of AD diagnosis and progression processes by providing detailed insights into the effect of different modalities on the disease risk.},

We demonstrate that P-NET can predict cancer state using molecular data with a performance that is superior to other modelling approaches. Moreover, the biological interpretability within P-NET revealed established and novel molecularly altered candidates, such as MDM4 and FGFR1, which were implicated in predicting advanced disease and validated in vitro. Broadly, biologically informed fully interpretable neural networks enable preclinical discovery and clinical prediction in prostate cancer and may have general applicability across cancer types.},

  abstract = {Replacing static word embeddings with contextualized word representations has yielded significant improvements on many NLP tasks. However, just how contextual are the contextualized representations produced by models such as ELMo and BERT? Are there infinitely many context-specific representations for each word, or are words essentially assigned one of a finite number of word-sense representations? For one, we find that the contextualized representations of all words are not isotropic in any layer of the contextualizing model. While representations of the same word in different contexts still have a greater cosine similarity than those of two different words, this self-similarity is much lower in upper layers. This suggests that upper layers of contextualizing models produce more context-specific representations, much like how upper layers of LSTMs produce more task-specific representations. In all layers of ELMo, BERT, and GPT-2, on average, less than 5\% of the variance in a word's contextualized representations can be explained by a static embedding for that word, providing some justification for the success of contextualized representations.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Technological advances have transformed vascular intervention in recent decades. In particular, improvements in imaging and data processing have allowed for the development of increasingly complex endovascular and hybrid interventions. Augmented reality (AR) is a subject of growing interest in surgery, with the potential to improve clinicians' understanding of 3D anatomy and aid in the processing of real-time information. This study hopes to elucidate the potential impact of AR technology in the rapidly evolving fields of vascular and endovascular surgery. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review is to summarize the fundamental concepts of AR technologies and conduct a scoping review of the impact of AR and mixed reality in vascular and endovascular surgery. METHODS: A systematic search of MEDLINE, Scopus, and Embase was performed in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. All studies written in English from inception until January 8, 2021, were included in the search. Combinations of the following keywords were used in the systematic search string: ("augmented reality" OR "hololens" OR "image overlay" OR "daqri" OR "magic leap" OR "immersive reality" OR "extended reality" OR "mixed reality" OR "head mounted display") AND ("vascular surgery" OR "endovascular"). Studies were selected through a blinded process between 2 investigators (JE and AS) and assessed using data quality tools. RESULTS: AR technologies have had a number of applications in vascular and endovascular surgery. Most studies (22/32, 69\%) used 3D imaging of computed tomography angiogram-derived images of vascular anatomy to augment clinicians' anatomical understanding during procedures. A wide range of AR technologies were used, with heads up fusion imaging and AR head-mounted displays being the most commonly applied clinically. AR applications included guiding open, robotic, and endovascular surgery while minimizing dissection, improving procedural times, and reducing radiation and contrast exposure. CONCLUSIONS: AR has shown promising developments in the field of vascular and endovascular surgery, with potential benefits to surgeons and patients alike. These include reductions in patient risk and operating times as well as in contrast and radiation exposure for radiological interventions. Further technological advances are required to overcome current limitations, including processing capacity and vascular deformation by instrumentation.},

  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) models, demonstrably powerful, suffer from a lack of interpretability. The absence of transparency, often referred to as the black box nature of ML models, undermines trust and urges the need for efforts to enhance their explainability. Explainable AI (XAI) techniques address this challenge by providing frameworks and methods to explain the internal decision-making processes of these complex models. Techniques like Counterfactual Explanations (CF) and Feature Importance play a crucial role in achieving this goal. Furthermore, high-quality and diverse data remains the foundational element for robust and trustworthy ML applications. In many applications, the data used to train ML and XAI explainers contain sensitive information. In this context, numerous privacy-preserving techniques can be employed to safeguard sensitive information in the data, such as differential privacy. Subsequently, a conflict between XAI and privacy solutions emerges due to their opposing goals. Since XAI techniques provide reasoning for the model behavior, they reveal information relative to ML models, such as their decision boundaries, the values of features, or the gradients of deep learning models when explanations are exposed to a third entity. Attackers can initiate privacy breaching attacks using these explanations, to perform model extraction, inference, and membership attacks. This dilemma underscores the challenge of finding the right equilibrium between understanding ML decision-making and safeguarding privacy.},

Model performance was assessed using time-dependent ROC curves and calibrations. During a median follow-up of 10.3 years, 1166 patients died. Although blood-DNAm-based predictive signatures achieved moderate performances, predictive signatures based on clinical features outperformed blood-DNAm signatures. The inclusion of blood-DNAm did not improve survival prediction over clinical features. M1 stage, age at blood collection, and N2 stage were the top contributors. Despite some prognostic value, incorporating blood DNA methylation did not enhance survival prediction of CRC patients beyond clinical features.},

We propose GRINCD, a novel GRN inference framework empowered by graph representation learning and causal asymmetric learning, considering both linear and non-linear regulatory relationships. First, high-quality representation of each gene is generated using graph neural network. Then, we apply the additive noise model to predict the causal regulation of each regulator-target pair. Additionally, we design two channels and finally assemble them for robust prediction. Through comprehensive comparisons of our framework with state-of-the-art methods based on different principles on numerous datasets of diverse types and scales, the experimental results show that our framework achieves superior or comparable performance under various evaluation metrics. Our work provides a new clue for constructing GRNs, and our proposed framework GRINCD also shows potential in identifying key factors affecting cancer development.},

However, important variables for one well-performing model (for example, a linear model \$f({\textbackslash}mathbf\{x\})={\textbackslash}mathbf\{x\}{\textasciicircum}\{T\}{\textbackslash}beta\$ with a fixed coefficient vector \${\textbackslash}beta\$) may be unimportant for another model. In this paper, we propose model class reliance (MCR) as the range of VI values across all well-performing model in a prespecified class. Thus, MCR gives a more comprehensive description of importance by accounting for the fact that many prediction models, possibly of different parametric forms, may fit the data well. In the process of deriving MCR, we show several informative results for permutation-based VI estimates, based on the VI measures used in Random Forests. Specifically, we derive connections between permutation importance estimates for a single prediction model, U-statistics, conditional variable importance, conditional causal effects, and linear model coefficients. We then give probabilistic bounds for MCR, using a novel, generalizable technique. We apply MCR to a public data set of Broward County criminal records to study the reliance of recidivism prediction models on sex and race. In this application, MCR can be used to help inform VI for unknown, proprietary models.},

However, its utility for biological discovery has so far been limited, given that generic deep neural networks provide little insight into the biological mechanisms that underlie a successful prediction. Here we demonstrate deep learning on biological networks, where every node has a molecular equivalent, such as a protein or gene, and every edge has a mechanistic interpretation, such as a regulatory interaction along a signaling pathway. RESULTS: With knowledge-primed neural networks (KPNNs), we exploit the ability of deep learning algorithms to assign meaningful weights in multi-layered networks, resulting in a widely applicable approach for interpretable deep learning. We present a learning method that enhances the interpretability of trained KPNNs by stabilizing node weights in the presence of redundancy, enhancing the quantitative interpretability of node weights, and controlling for uneven connectivity in biological networks. We validate KPNNs on simulated data with known ground truth and demonstrate their practical use and utility in five biological applications with single-cell RNA-seq~data for cancer and immune cells. CONCLUSIONS: We introduce KPNNs as a method that combines the predictive power of deep learning with the interpretability of biological networks. While demonstrated here on single-cell sequencing data, this method is broadly relevant to other research areas where prior domain knowledge can be represented as networks.},

  abstract = {Abstract             This review aims to explore the growing impact of machine learning and deep learning algorithms in the medical field, with a specific focus on the critical issues of explainability and interpretability associated with black-box algorithms. While machine learning algorithms are increasingly employed for medical analysis and diagnosis, their complexity underscores the importance of understanding how these algorithms explain and interpret data to take informed decisions. This review comprehensively analyzes challenges and solutions presented in the literature, offering an overview of the most recent techniques utilized in this field. It also provides precise definitions of interpretability and explainability, aiming to clarify the distinctions between these concepts and their implications for the decision-making process. Our analysis, based on 448 articles and addressing seven research questions, reveals an exponential growth in this field over the last decade. The psychological dimensions of public perception underscore the necessity for effective communication regarding the capabilities and limitations of artificial intelligence. Researchers are actively developing techniques to enhance interpretability, employing visualization methods and reducing model complexity. However, the persistent challenge lies in finding the delicate balance between achieving high performance and maintaining interpretability. Acknowledging the growing significance of artificial intelligence in aiding medical diagnosis and therapy, and the creation of interpretable artificial intelligence models is considered essential. In this dynamic context, an unwavering commitment to transparency, ethical considerations, and interdisciplinary collaboration is imperative to ensure the responsible use of artificial intelligence. This collective commitment is vital for establishing enduring trust between clinicians and patients, addressing emerging challenges, and facilitating the informed adoption of these advanced technologies in medicine.},

In Medical Affairs (MA) departments of the pharmaceutical industry AI holds great potential for positively influencing the medical mission of identifying and addressing unmet medical needs and care gaps, and fostering solutions that improve the egalitarian and unbiased access of patients to treatments worldwide. Given the essential position of MA in corporate interactions with various healthcare stakeholders, AI offers broad possibilities to support strategic decision-making and to pioneer novel approaches in medical stakeholder interactions. By analyzing data derived from the healthcare environment and by streamlining operations in medical content generation, AI advances data-based prioritization and strategy execution. In this review, we discuss promising AI-based solutions in MA that support the effective use of heterogenous information from observations of the healthcare environment, the enhancement of medical education, and the analysis of real-world data. For a successful implementation of such solutions, specific considerations partly unique to healthcare must be taken care of, for example, transparency, data privacy, healthcare regulations, and in predictive applications, explainability.},

Thyroid nodules are common glandular abnormality that need to be diagnosed as benign or malignant to determine further treatments. Clinically, ultrasonography is the main diagnostic method, but it is highly subjective with severe variability. Recently, many deep-learning-based methods have been proposed to alleviate subjectivity and achieve good results yet, these methods often neglect important guidance from clinical knowledge. Our objective is to utilize such guidance for accurate and reliable thyroid nodule classification.               Approach               . In this study, a multi-task learning model embedded with clinical knowledge of ACR Thyroid Imaging, Reporting and Data System guideline is proposed. The clinical features defined in the guideline have strong correlations with malignancy and they were modeled as tasks alongside the pathological type. Multi-task learning was utilized to exploit the correlations to improve diagnostic performance. To alleviate the impact of noisy labels on clinical features, a loss-weighting strategy was proposed. Five-fold cross-validation was applied to an internal training set of size 4989, and an external test set of size 243 was used for evaluation.               Main results               . The proposed multi-task learning model achieved an average AUC of 0.901 and an ensemble AUC of 0.917 on the test set, which significantly outperformed the single-task baseline models.               Significance               . The results indicated that multi-task learning of clinical features can effectively classify thyroid nodules and reveal the possibility of using clinical indicators as auxiliary tasks to improve performance when diagnosing other diseases.},

However, the black-box nature of these models results in a lack of interpretability in their predictions, and the design of deep network architectures significantly impacts the final prediction outcomes. The introduction of Kolmogorov--Arnold Network (KAN) provides an excellent solution to both of these issues. We hope that the KAN mechanism can provide fully interpretable neural network models, enhancing the potential for practical deployment. At the same time, KAN is capable of achieving good prediction results across various network architectures and neuron counts. We conducted case studies using real-world data from the Tokyo Meteorological Observatory to predict solar radiation and outdoor temperature, comparing the results with those of commonly used recurrent neural network baseline models. The results indicate that KAN can maintain model performance regardless of the chosen number of neurons. For instance, in the solar radiation prediction task, the KAN with a single hidden neuron reduces the MSE error by 75.33\% compared to the baseline model. More importantly, KAN allows for the quantification of each step in the network's computations, thereby enhancing overall interpretability.},

  abstract = {AbstractWith the advances in artificial intelligence (AI), data-driven algorithms are becoming increasingly popular in the medical domain. However, due to the nonlinear and complex behavior of many of these algorithms, decision-making by such algorithms is not trustworthy for clinicians and is considered a black-box process. Hence, the scientific community has introduced explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to remedy the problem. This systematic scoping review investigates the application of XAI in breast cancer detection and risk prediction. We conducted a comprehensive search on Scopus, IEEE Explore, PubMed, and Google Scholar (first 50 citations) using a systematic search strategy. The search spanned from January 2017 to July 2023, focusing on peer-reviewed studies implementing XAI methods in breast cancer datasets. Thirty studies met our inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. The results revealed that SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is the top model-agnostic XAI technique in breast cancer research in terms of usage, explaining the model prediction results, diagnosis and classification of biomarkers, and prognosis and survival analysis. Additionally, the SHAP model primarily explained tree-based ensemble machine learning models.

Additionally, it is relatively easy to implement effectively and completely suits performant models, such as tree-based models.

However, the concept of "black box" in AI limits the potential of this approach to be translated into the clinical practice. In contrast, explainable AI (XAI) focuses on making AI results understandable to humans. Here, we present a novel XAI method -called multi-dimensional module optimization (MOM)- that associates drug screening with genetic events, while guaranteeing that predictions are interpretable and robust. We applied MOM to an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cohort of 319 ex-vivo tumor samples with 122 screened drugs and WES. MOM returned a therapeutic strategy based on the FLT3, CBF{$\beta$}-MYH11, and NRAS status, which predicted AML patient response to Quizartinib, Trametinib, Selumetinib, and Crizotinib. We successfully validated the results in three different large-scale screening experiments. We believe that XAI will help healthcare providers and drug regulators better understand AI medical decisions.},

Classical partial dependence plots (PDPs) help visualize the average partial relationship between the predicted response and one or more features. In the presence of substantial interaction effects, the partial response relationship can be heterogeneous. Thus, an average curve, such as the PDP, can obfuscate the complexity of the modeled relationship. Accordingly, ICE plots refine the partial dependence plot by graphing the functional relationship between the predicted response and the feature for individual observations. Specifically, ICE plots highlight the variation in the fitted values across the range of a covariate, suggesting where and to what extent heterogeneities might exist. In addition to providing a plotting suite for exploratory analysis, we include a visual test for additive structure in the data generating model. Through simulated examples and real data sets, we demonstrate how ICE plots can shed light on estimated models in ways PDPs cannot. Procedures outlined are available in the R package ICEbox.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Healthcare data provides a unique opportunity to learn causal relationships but the largest datasets, such as from hospitals or intensive care units, are often observational and do not standardize variables collected for all patients. Rather, the variables depend on a patient's health status, treatment plan, and differences between providers. This poses major challenges for causal inference, which either must restrict analysis to patients with complete data (reducing power) or learn patient-specific models (making it difficult to generalize). While missing variables can lead to confounding, variables absent for one individual are often measured in another. METHODS: We propose a novel method, called Causal Model Combination for Time Series (CMC-TS), to learn causal relationships from time series with partially overlapping variable sets. CMC-TS overcomes errors by specifically leveraging partial overlap between datasets (e.g., patients) to iteratively reconstruct missing variables and correct errors by reweighting inferences using shared information across datasets. We evaluated CMC-TS and compared it to the state of the art on both simulated data and real-world data from stroke patients admitted to a neurological intensive care unit. RESULTS: On simulated data, CMC-TS had the fewest false discoveries and highest F1-score compared to baselines. On real data from stroke patients in a neurological intensive care unit, we found fewer implausible and more highly ranked plausible causes of a clinically important adverse event. CONCLUSION: Our approach may lead to better use of observational healthcare data for causal inference, by enabling causal inference from patient data with partially overlapping variable sets.},

Many existing explainability methods rely solely on correlations and fail to account for confounding, which may result in potentially misleading explanations. To overcome this problem, we define the Causal Concept Effect (CaCE) as the causal effect of (the presence or absence of) a human-interpretable concept on a deep neural net's predictions. We show that the CaCE measure can avoid errors stemming from confounding. Estimating CaCE is difficult in situations where we cannot easily simulate the do-operator. To mitigate this problem, we use a generative model, specifically a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE), to measure VAE-CaCE. In an extensive experimental analysis, we show that the VAE-CaCE is able to estimate the true concept causal effect, compared to baselines for a number of datasets including high dimensional images.},

  abstract = {Triple-negative breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease associated with poor outcomes. Often treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, achieving pCR at the end of treatment is a goal and predicts patient survival. But predicting pCR from the outset could be of clinical interest and avoid the administration of ineffective treatments. Here we present a proof-of-concept study of a multimodal machine learning algorithm incorporating PET (including radiomics), histopathological, genomic, and clinical features. The algorithm developed can predict pCR in triple negative breast cancers with an AUC of 0,82 and show a tendency to correlate with long-term outcomes. This early prediction of response to chemotherapy could lead to propose more personalized treatment., Purpose: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a biologically and clinically heterogeneous disease, associated with poorer outcomes when compared with other subtypes of breast cancer. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is often given before surgery, and achieving a pathological complete response (pCR) has been associated with patient outcomes. There is thus strong clinical interest in the ability to accurately predict pCR status using baseline data. Materials and Methods: A cohort of 57 TNBC patients who underwent FDG-PET/CT before NAC was analyzed to develop a machine learning (ML) algorithm predictive of pCR. A total of 241 predictors were collected for each patient: 11 clinical features, 11 histopathological features, 13 genomic features, and 206 PET features, including 195 radiomic features. The optimization criterion was the area under the ROC curve (AUC). Event-free survival (EFS) was estimated using the Kaplan--Meier method. Results: The best ML algorithm reached an AUC of 0.82. The features with the highest weight in the algorithm were a mix of PET (including radiomics), histopathological, genomic, and clinical features, highlighting the importance of truly multimodal analysis. Patients with predicted pCR tended to have a longer EFS than patients with predicted non-pCR, even though this difference was not significant, probably due to the small sample size and few events observed (p = 0.09). Conclusions: This study suggests that ML applied to baseline multimodal data can help predict pCR status after NAC for TNBC patients and may identify correlations with long-term outcomes. Patients predicted as non-pCR may benefit from concomitant treatment with immunotherapy or dose intensification.},

We examine the impact of knowledge representation, such as rules and semantic networks, language structure and relational structure, and whether implicit or explicit reasoning contributes to higher promise scores. We find that systems where logic is compiled into the neural network lead to the most NeSy goals being satisfied, while other factors such as knowledge representation, or type of neural architecture do not exhibit a clear correlation with goals being met. We find many discrepancies in how reasoning is defined, specifically in relation to human level reasoning, which impact decisions about model architectures and drive conclusions which are not always consistent across studies. Hence we advocate for a more methodical approach to the application of theories of human reasoning as well as the development of appropriate benchmarks, which we hope can lead to a better understanding of progress in the field. We make our data and code available on github for further analysis.11 https://github.com/kyleiwaniec/neuro-symbolic-ai-systematic-review},

  abstract = {Continual learning aims to rapidly and continually learn the current task from a sequence of tasks, using the knowledge obtained in the past, while performing well on prior tasks. A key challenge in this setting is the stability--plasticity dilemma existing in current and previous tasks, i.e., a high-stability network is weak to learn new knowledge in an effort to maintain previous knowledge. Correspondingly, a high-plasticity network can easily forget old tasks while dealing with well on the new task. Compared to other kinds of methods, the methods based on experience replay have shown great advantages to overcome catastrophic forgetting. One common limitation of this method is the data imbalance between the previous and current tasks, which would further aggravate forgetting. Moreover, how to effectively address the stability--plasticity dilemma in this setting is also an urgent problem to be solved. In this paper, we overcome these challenges by proposing a novel framework called Meta-learning update via Multi-scale Knowledge Distillation and Data Augmentation (MMKDDA). Specifically, we apply multi-scale knowledge distillation to grasp the evolution of long-range and short-range spatial relationships at different feature levels to alleviate the problem of data imbalance. Besides, our method mixes the samples from the episodic memory and current task in the online continual training procedure, thus alleviating the side influence due to the change of probability distribution. Moreover, we optimize our model via the meta-learning update by resorting to the number of tasks seen previously, which is helpful to keep a better balance between stability and plasticity. Finally, our extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed MMKDDA framework against other popular baselines, and ablation studies are also conducted to further analyze the role of each component in our framework.},

  abstract = {The integration of multi-omics data---encompassing genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics---has revolutionized biomedical research, offering unprecedented insights into disease mechanisms and therapeutic interventions. However, the complexity and volume of multi-omics datasets present significant analytical challenges that traditional computational methods struggle to address. Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly deep learning and neural networks, has emerged as a powerful tool to overcome these limitations by enabling advanced data integration, biomarker discovery, and personalized treatment strategies. This paper explores the role of AI-driven multi-omics data integration in enhancing disease prediction, early diagnosis, and precision medicine. By leveraging AI models such as deep neural networks (DNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and transformers, researchers can analyze complex biological interactions, identify patterns indicative of disease onset, and stratify patient populations for tailored treatment approaches. Additionally, AI-powered feature selection methods facilitate the identification of disease-specific biomarkers across multiple omics layers, paving the way for more effective targeted therapies. Moreover, AI plays a crucial role in pharmacogenomics by predicting individualized drug responses, optimizing dosage regimens, and minimizing adverse drug reactions. Machine learning algorithms, including reinforcement learning and generative models, enable real-time modeling of drug-gene interactions, leading to safer and more efficacious therapeutic interventions. Despite the transformative potential of AI in multi-omics data analysis, challenges such as data standardization, model interpretability, and ethical considerations must be addressed to ensure reliability and clinical applicability. This paper provides a comprehensive review of AI-driven multi-omics research, highlighting current advancements, challenges, and future directions in precision medicine.},

  abstract = {Modern deep learning approaches have achieved great success in many vision applications by training a model using all available task-specific data. However, there are two major obstacles making it challenging to implement for real life applications: (1) Learning new classes makes the trained model quickly forget old classes knowledge, which is referred to as catastrophic forgetting. (2) As new observations of old classes come sequentially over time, the distribution may change in unforeseen way, making the performance degrade dramatically on future data, which is referred to as concept drift. Current state-of-the-art incremental learning methods require a long time to train the model whenever new classes are added and none of them takes into consideration the new observations of old classes. In this paper, we propose an incremental learning framework that can work in the challenging online learning scenario and handle both new classes data and new observations of old classes. We address problem (1) in online mode by introducing a modified cross-distillation loss together with a two-step learning technique. Our method outperforms the results obtained from current state-of-the-art offline incremental learning methods on the CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1000 (ILSVRC 2012) datasets under the same experiment protocol but in online scenario. We also provide a simple yet effective method to mitigate problem (2) by updating exemplar set using the feature of each new observation of old classes and demonstrate a real life application of online food image classification based on our complete framework using the Food-101 dataset.},

  abstract = {The goal of Machine Learning to automatically learn from data, extract knowledge and to make decisions without any human intervention. Such automatic (aML) approaches show impressive success. Recent results even demonstrate intriguingly that deep learning applied for automatic classification of skin lesions is on par with the performance of dermatologists, yet outperforms the average. As human perception is inherently limited, such approaches can discover patterns, e.g. that two objects are similar, in arbitrarily high-dimensional spaces what no human is able to do. Humans can deal only with limited amounts of data, whilst big data is beneficial for aML; however, in health informatics, we are often confronted with a small number of data sets, where aML suffer of insufficient training samples and many problems are computationally hard. Here, interactive machine learning (iML) may be of help, where a human-in-the-loop contributes to reduce the complexity of NP-hard problems. A further motivation for iML is that standard black-box approaches lack transparency, hence do not foster trust and acceptance of ML among end-users. Rising legal and privacy aspects, e.g. with the new European General Data Protection Regulations, make black-box approaches difficult to use, because they often are not able to explain why a decision has been made. In this paper, we present some experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the human-in-the-loop approach, particularly in opening the black-box to a glass-box and thus enabling a human directly to interact with an learning algorithm. We selected the Ant Colony Optimization framework, and applied it on the Traveling Salesman Problem, which is a good example, due to its relevance for health informatics, e.g. for the study of protein folding. From studies of how humans extract so much from so little data, fundamental ML-research also may benefit.},

Deep learning approaches, trained on extremely large data sets or using reinforcement learning methods have even exceeded human performance in visual tasks, particularly on playing games such as Atari, or mastering the game of Go. Even in the medical domain there are remarkable results. The central problem of such models is that they are regarded as black-box models and even if we understand the underlying mathematical principles, they lack an explicit declarative knowledge representation, hence have difficulty in generating the underlying explanatory structures. This calls for systems enabling to make decisions transparent, understandable and explainable. A huge motivation for our approach are rising legal and privacy aspects. The new European General Data Protection Regulation entering into force on May 25th 2018, will make black-box approaches difficult to use in business. This does not imply a ban on automatic learning approaches or an obligation to explain everything all the time, however, there must be a possibility to make the results re-traceable on demand. In this paper we outline some of our research topics in the context of the relatively new area of explainable-AI with a focus on the application in medicine, which is a very special domain. This is due to the fact that medical professionals are working mostly with distributed heterogeneous and complex sources of data. In this paper we concentrate on three sources: images, *omics data and text. We argue that research in explainable-AI would generally help to facilitate the implementation of AI/ML in the medical domain, and specifically help to facilitate transparency and trust.},

  abstract = {Explainable artificial intelligence (AI) is attracting much interest in medicine. Technically, the problem of explainability is as old as AI itself and classic AI represented comprehensible retraceable approaches. However, their weakness was in dealing with uncertainties of the real world. Through the introduction of probabilistic learning, applications became increasingly successful, but increasingly opaque. Explainable AI deals with the implementation of transparency and traceability of statistical black-box machine learning methods, particularly deep learning (DL). We argue that there is a need to go beyond explainable AI. To reach a level of               explainable medicine               we need causability.

Nevertheless, correlation is not causation and successful models are often complex ``black-boxes'', which make it hard to understand why a result has been achieved. The explainable AI (xAI) community develops methods, e.\,g. to highlight which input parameters are relevant for a result; however, in the medical domain there is a need for causability: In the same way that usability encompasses measurements for the quality of use, causability encompasses measurements for the quality of explanations produced by xAI. The key for future human-AI interfaces is to map explainability with causability and to allow a domain expert to ask questions to understand why an AI came up with a result, and also to ask ``what-if'' questions (counterfactuals) to gain insight into the underlying independent explanatory factors of a result. A multi-modal causability is important in the medical domain because often different modalities contribute to a result.},

  abstract = {Recent success in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) allow problem solving automatically without any human intervention. Autonomous approaches can be very convenient. However, in certain domains, e.g., in the medical domain, it is necessary to enable a domain expert to understand, why an algorithm came up with a certain result. Consequently, the field of Explainable AI (xAI) rapidly gained interest worldwide in various domains, particularly in medicine. Explainable AI studies transparency and traceability of opaque AI/ML and there are already a huge variety of methods. For example with layer-wise relevance propagation relevant parts of inputs to, and representations in, a neural network which caused a result, can be highlighted. This is a first important step to ensure that end users, e.g., medical professionals, assume responsibility for decision making with AI/ML and of interest to professionals and regulators. Interactive ML adds the component of human expertise to AI/ML processes by enabling them to re-enact and retrace AI/ML results, e.g. let them check it for plausibility. This requires new human--AI interfaces for explainable AI. In order to build effective and efficient interactive human--AI interfaces we have to deal with the question of how to evaluate the quality of explanations given by an explainable AI system. In this paper we introduce our System Causability Scale to measure the quality of explanations. It is based on our notion of Causability (Holzinger et al. in Wiley Interdiscip Rev Data Min Knowl Discov 9(4), 2019) combined with concepts adapted from a widely-accepted usability scale.},

  abstract = {AI is remarkably successful and outperforms human experts in certain tasks, even in complex domains such as medicine. Humans on the other hand are experts at multi-modal thinking and can embed new inputs almost instantly into a conceptual knowledge space shaped by experience. In many fields the aim is to build systems capable of explaining themselves, engaging in interactive what-if questions. Such questions, called counterfactuals, are becoming important in the rising field of explainable AI (xAI). Our central hypothesis is that using conceptual knowledge as a guiding model of reality will help to train more explainable, more robust and less biased machine learning models, ideally able to learn from fewer data. One important aspect in the medical domain is that various modalities contribute to one single result. Our main question is ``How can we construct a multi-modal feature representation space (spanning images, text, genomics data) using knowledge bases as an initial connector for the development of novel explanation interface techniques?''. In this paper we argue for using Graph Neural Networks as a method-of-choice, enabling information fusion for multi-modal causability (causability -- not to confuse with causality -- is the measurable extent to which an explanation to a human expert achieves a specified level of causal understanding). The aim of this paper is to motivate the international xAI community to further work into the fields of multi-modal embeddings and interactive explainability, to lay the foundations for effective future human--AI interfaces. We emphasize that Graph Neural Networks play a major role for multi-modal causability, since causal links between features can be defined directly using graph structures.},

  abstract = {Enormous advances in the domain of statistical machine learning, the availability of large amounts of training data, and increasing computing power have made Artificial Intelligence (AI) very successful. For certain tasks, algorithms can even achieve performance beyond the human level. Unfortunately, the most powerful methods suffer from the fact that it is difficult to explain why a certain result was achieved on the one hand, and that they lack robustness on the other. Our most powerful machine learning models are very sensitive to even small changes. Perturbations in the input data can have a dramatic impact on the output and lead to entirely different results. This is of great importance in virtually all critical domains where we suffer from low data quality, i.e. we do not have the expected i.i.d. data. Therefore, the use of AI in domains that impact human life (agriculture, climate, health, ...) has led to an increased demand for trustworthy AI. Explainability is now even mandatory due to regulatory requirements in sensitive domains such as medicine, which requires traceability, transparency and interpretability capabilities. One possible step to make AI more robust is to combine statistical learning with knowledge representations. For certain tasks, it can be advantageous to use a human in the loop. A human expert can - sometimes, of course not always - bring experience, domain knowledge and conceptual understanding to the AI pipeline. Such approaches are not only a solution from a legal point of view, but in many application areas the ``why'' is often more important than a pure classification result. Consequently, both explainability and robustness can promote reliability and trust and ensure that humans remain in control, thus complementing human intelligence with artificial intelligence.},

  abstract = {The increasing demand for transparent and reliable models, particularly in high-stakes decision-making areas such as medical image analysis, has led to the emergence of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). Post-hoc XAI techniques, which aim to explain black-box models after training, have raised concerns about their fidelity to model predictions. In contrast, Self-eXplainable AI (S-XAI) offers a compelling alternative by incorporating explainability directly into the training process of deep learning models. This approach allows models to generate inherent explanations that are closely aligned with their internal decision-making processes, enhancing transparency and supporting the trustworthiness, robustness, and accountability of AI systems in real-world medical applications. To facilitate the development of S-XAI methods for medical image analysis, this survey presents a comprehensive review across various image modalities and clinical applications. It covers more than 200 papers from three key perspectives: 1) input explainability through the integration of explainable feature engineering and knowledge graph, 2) model explainability via attention-based learning, concept-based learning, and prototype-based learning, and 3) output explainability by providing textual and counterfactual explanations. This paper also outlines desired characteristics of explainability and evaluation methods for assessing explanation quality, while discussing major challenges and future research directions in developing S-XAI for medical image analysis.},

Among these XAI methods, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to restrict the model's latent space to human-understandable high-level concepts by generating a conceptual layer for extracting conceptual features, which has drawn much attention recently. However, existing methods rely solely on concept features to determine the model's predictions, which overlook the intrinsic feature embeddings within medical images. To address this utility gap between the original models and concept-based models, we propose Vision Concept Transformer (VCT). Furthermore, despite their benefits, CBMs have been found to negatively impact model performance and fail to provide stable explanations when faced with input perturbations, which limits their application in the medical field. To address this faithfulness issue, this paper further proposes the Stable Vision Concept Transformer (SVCT) based on VCT, which leverages the vision transformer (ViT) as its backbone and incorporates a conceptual layer. SVCT employs conceptual features to enhance decision-making capabilities by fusing them with image features and ensures model faithfulness through the integration of Denoised Diffusion Smoothing. Comprehensive experiments on four medical datasets demonstrate that our VCT and SVCT maintain accuracy while remaining interpretable compared to baselines. Furthermore, even when subjected to perturbations, our SVCT model consistently provides faithful explanations, thus meeting the needs of the medical field.},

Causal inference frameworks rely on structured data, typically represented in flat tables or relational models. These frameworks estimate causal effects based only on explicit facts, overlooking implicit information in the data, which can lead to inaccurate causal estimates. Knowledge graphs (KGs) inherently capture implicit information through logical rules applied to explicit facts, providing a unique opportunity to leverage implicit knowledge. However, existing frameworks are not applicable to KGs due to their semi-structured nature. CauseKG is a causal inference framework designed to address the intricacies of KGs and seamlessly integrate implicit information using KG-specific entailment techniques, providing a more accurate causal inference process. We empirically evaluate the effectiveness of CauseKG against benchmarks constructed from synthetic and real-world datasets. The results suggest that CauseKG can produce a lower mean absolute error in causal inference compared to state-of-the-art methods. The empirical results demonstrate CauseKG's ability to address causal questions in a variety of domains. This research highlights the importance of extending causal inference techniques to KGs, emphasising the improved accuracy that can be achieved by integrating implicit and explicit information.},

  abstract = {Background and Objectives: Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) represent the foremost methodology for sharing state-of-the-art research findings in the healthcare domain with medical practitioners to limit practice variations, reduce clinical cost, improve the quality of care, and provide evidence based treatment. However, extracting relevant knowledge from the plethora of CPGs is not feasible for already burdened healthcare professionals, leading to large gaps between clinical findings and real practices. It is therefore imperative that state-of-the-art Computing research, especially machine learning is used to provide artificial intelligence based solution for extracting the knowledge from CPGs and reducing the gap between healthcare research/guidelines and practice. Methods: This research presents a novel methodology for knowledge extraction from CPGs to reduce the gap and turn the latest research findings into clinical practice. First, our system classifies the CPG sentences into four classes such as condition-action, condition-consequences, action, and not-applicable based on the information presented in a sentence. We use deep learning with state-of-the-art word embedding, improved word vectors technique in classification process. Second, it identifies qualifier terms in the classified sentences, which assist in recognizing the condition and action phrases in a sentence. Finally, the condition and action phrase are processed and transformed into plain rule If Condition(s) Then Action format. Results: We evaluate the methodology on three different domains guidelines including Hypertension, Rhinosinusitis, and Asthma. The deep learning model classifies the CPG sentences with an accuracy of 95\%. While rule extraction was validated by user-centric approach, which achieved a Jaccard coefficient of 0.6, 0.7, and 0.4 with three human experts extracted rules, respectively.},

  abstract = {Advancements in high-throughput technologies have led to a shift from traditional hypothesis-driven methodologies to data-driven approaches. Multi-omics refers to the integrative analysis of data derived from multiple 'omes', such as genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and microbiomics. This approach enables a comprehensive understanding of biological systems by capturing different layers of biological information. Deep learning methods are increasingly utilized to integrate multi-omics data, offering insights into molecular interactions and enhancing research into complex diseases. However, these models, with their numerous interconnected layers and nonlinear relationships, often function as black boxes, lacking transparency in decision-making processes. To overcome this challenge, explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) methods are crucial for creating transparent models that allow clinicians to interpret and work with complex data more effectively. This review explores how xAI can improve the interpretability of deep learning models in multi-omics research, highlighting its potential to provide clinicians with clear insights, thereby facilitating the effective application of such models in clinical settings.},

  abstract = {Cancer remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, necessitating accurate diagnosis and prognosis. Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) has become an integral part of clinical workflows with advancements in digital pathology. While various studies have utilized WSIs, their extracted features may not fully capture the most relevant pathological information, and their lack of interpretability limits clinical adoption.  In this paper, we propose PATH-X, a framework that integrates Vision Transformers (ViT) and Autoencoders with SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) to enhance model explainability for patient stratification and risk prediction using WSIs from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). A representative image slice is selected from each WSI, and numerical feature embeddings are extracted using Google's pre-trained ViT. These features are then compressed via an autoencoder and used for unsupervised clustering and classification tasks. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis is applied to evaluate stratification into two and three risk groups. SHAP is used to identify key contributing features, which are mapped onto histopathological slices to provide spatial context.  PATH-X demonstrates strong performance in breast and glioma cancers, where a sufficient number of WSIs enabled robust stratification. However, performance in lung cancer was limited due to data availability, emphasizing the need for larger datasets to enhance model reliability and clinical applicability.},

  abstract = {Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by female anopheles mosquito bites. Various plasmodium parasites spread in the victim's blood cells and keep their life in a critical situation. If not treated at the early stage, malaria can cause even death. Microscopy is a familiar process for diagnosing malaria, collecting the victim's blood samples, and counting the parasite and red blood cells. However, the microscopy process is time-consuming and can produce an erroneous result in some cases. With the recent success of machine learning and deep learning in medical diagnosis, it is quite possible to minimize diagnosis costs and improve overall detection accuracy compared with the traditional microscopy method. This paper proposes a multiheaded attention-based transformer model to diagnose the malaria parasite from blood cell images. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, the gradient-weighted class activation map (Grad-CAM) technique was implemented to identify which parts of an image the proposed model paid much more attention to compared with the remaining parts by generating a heatmap image. The proposed model achieved a testing accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, and AUC score of 96.41\%, 96.99\%, 95.88\%, 96.44\%, and 99.11\%, respectively, for the original malaria parasite dataset and 99.25\%, 99.08\%, 99.42\%, 99.25\%, and 99.99\%, respectively, for the modified dataset. Various hyperparameters were also finetuned to obtain optimum results, which were also compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for malaria parasite detection, and the proposed method outperformed the existing methods.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer's disease highlight the need for early detection of cognitive decline. However, most primary care providers do not currently perform routine cognitive testing, in part due to a lack of time and resources to administer and interpret the tests. Brief, self-scoring, and sensitive digital cognitive assessments, such as the Linus Health Core Cognitive Evaluation (CCE)--which includes the Digital Clock and Recall (DCR™) and the Life and Health Questionnaire (LHQ)--can automatically provide medically-informed recommendations that can address this need. Here we evaluate the clinical appropriateness of the recommendations generated by this clinical decision support (CDS) tool to guide the diagnosis of cognitive impairment by primary care providers (PCPs).                                         Method               The CDS tool uses data from the CCE to list potential medical concerns and recommend pathways toward formal diagnosis and/or care. We conducted a retrospective expert-review study in June 2023 to evaluate the nine CDS pathways for patients aged 55 and above. Experts were five board-certified cognitive neurologists affiliated with academic institutions. We calculated the median ratings (on a scale of 1 to 9, where 9 is high appropriateness) for the nine CDS pathways across raters. A rating of 7 or above was deemed clinically appropriate.                                         Result               All 7 pathways related to cognitive impairment received a clinically appropriate rating (median = 7, SD = 0.3, range=7-8). Pathways below the appropriateness threshold included the one for Green DCR scores (i.e., cognitively unimpaired; median = 6, SD = 0.87) and a preliminary Lecanemab eligibility pathway (median = 5, SD = 1.10).                                         Conclusion               Pathways and the cognition-related recommendations generated by the CDS tool of the Linus Health CCE are clinically appropriate, as rated by this initial survey of board-certified, academic cognitive neurologists.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) that can amass Electronic Health Record (EHR) and other patient data holds promise to provide accurate classification and guide treatment choices. Our objective is to develop the Decision Support System for Making Personalized Assessments and Recommendations Concerning Breast Cancer Patients (DPAC), which is a CDSS learned from data that recommends the optimal treatment decisions based on a patient's features. METHOD: We developed a Bayesian network architecture called Causal Modeling with Internal Layers (CAMIL), and an algorithm called Treatment Feature Interactions (TFI), which learns from data the interactions needed in a CAMIL model. Using the TFI algorithm, we learned interactions for six treatments from the LSDS-5YDM dataset. We created a CAMIL model using these interactions, resulting in a DPAC which recommends treatments towards preventing 5-year breast cancer metastasis. RESULTS: In a 5-fold cross-validation analysis, we compared the probability of being metastasis free in 5 years for patients who made decisions recommended by DPAC to those who did not. These probabilities are (the probability for those making the decisions appears first): chemotherapy (.938, .872); breast/chest wall radiation (.939, .902); nodal field radiation (.940, .784); antihormone (.941, .906); HER2 inhibitors (.934, .880); neadjuvant therapy (.931, .837). In an application of DPAC to the independent METABRIC dataset, the probabilities for chemotherapy were (.845, .788). DISCUSSION: Patients who took the advice of DPAC had, as a group, notably better outcomes than those who did not. We conclude that DPAC is effective at amassing and analyzing data towards treatment recommendations. Some of the findings in DPAC are controversial. For example, DPAC says that chemotherapy increases the chances of metastasis for many node negative patients. This controversy shows the importance of developing a conclusive version of DPAC to ensure we provide patients with the best patient-specific treatment recommendations.},

Despite a lot of automatic methods have been proposed for either image or text analysis in computer vision or natural language research areas, much fewer studies have been developed for the fusion of medical image and EHR data for medical problems. Among existing early or intermediate fusion methods, concatenation of features from both modalities is still a mainstream. For a better exploiting of image and EHR data, we propose a multi-modal attention module which use EHR data to help the selection of important regions during image feature extraction process conducted by traditional CNN. Moreover, we propose to incorporate multi-head machnism to gated multimodal unit (GMU) to make it able to parallelly fuse image and EHR features in different subspaces. With the help of the two modules, existing CNN architecture can be enhanced using both modalities. Experiments on predicting Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) of intracerebral hemorrhage patients and classifying Alzheimer's Disease showed the proposed method can automatically focus on task-related areas and achieve better results by making better use of image and EHR features.},

Clinical predictive models can help physicians and administrators make decisions by forecasting clinical and operational events. Existing structured data-based clinical predictive models have limited use in everyday practice owing to complexity in data processing, as well as model development and deployment1--3. Here we show that unstructured clinical notes from the electronic health record can enable the training of clinical language models, which can be used as all-purpose clinical predictive engines with low-resistance development and deployment. Our approach leverages recent advances in natural language processing4,5 to train a large language model for medical language (NYUTron) and subsequently fine-tune it across a wide range of clinical and operational predictive tasks. We evaluated our approach within our health system for five such tasks: 30-day all-cause readmission prediction, in-hospital mortality prediction, comorbidity index prediction, length of stay prediction, and insurance denial prediction. We show that NYUTron has an area under the curve (AUC) of 78.7--94.9\%, with an improvement of 5.36--14.7\% in the AUC compared with traditional models. We additionally demonstrate the benefits of pretraining with clinical text, the potential for increasing generalizability to different sites through fine-tuning and the full deployment of our system in a prospective, single-arm trial. These results show the potential for using clinical language models in medicine to read alongside physicians and provide guidance at the point of care.},

Combining omics data and demographic/clinical information can offer a more comprehensive view of cancer prognosis than using omics or clinical data alone and can also reveal the underlying disease mechanisms at the molecular level. In this study, we developed and validated a deep learning framework to extract information from high-dimensional gene expression and miRNA expression data and conduct prognosis prediction for breast cancer and ovarian-cancer patients using multiple independent multi-omics datasets. Our model achieved significantly better prognosis prediction than the current machine learning and deep learning approaches in various settings. Moreover, an interpretation method was applied to tackle the ``black-box'' nature of deep neural networks and we identified features (i.e., genes, miRNA, demographic/clinical variables) that were important to distinguish predicted high- and low-risk patients. The significance of the identified features was partially supported by previous studies.},

In medical image analysis, a high degree of transparency and model interpretability can help clinicians better understand and trust the decision-making process of AI models. In this study, we propose a Knowledge Distillation (KD)-based approach that aims to enhance the transparency of the AI model in medical image analysis. The initial step is to use traditional CNN to obtain a teacher model and then use KD to simplify the CNN architecture, retain most of the features of the data set, and reduce the number of network layers. It also uses the feature map of the student model to perform hierarchical analysis to identify key features and decision-making processes. This leads to intuitive visual explanations. We selected three public medical data sets (brain tumor, eye disease, and Alzheimer's disease) to test our method. It shows that even when the number of layers is reduced, our model provides a remarkable result in the test set and reduces the time required for the interpretability analysis.},

By replacing the correlation model with a stable and interpretable causal model, it is possible to mitigate the misleading nature of spurious correlations and overcome the limitations of model calculations. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and structured review of causal inference methods in deep learning. Brain-like inference ideas are discussed from a brain-inspired perspective, and the basic concepts of causal learning are introduced.

  abstract = {Chain of Thought (CoT) is significant in improving the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the correlation between the effectiveness of CoT and the length of reasoning steps in prompts remains largely unknown. To shed light on this, we have conducted several empirical experiments to explore the relations. Specifically, we design experiments that expand and compress the rationale reasoning steps within CoT demonstrations while keeping all other factors constant. We have the following key findings. First, the results indicate that lengthening the reasoning steps in prompts, even without adding new information into the prompt, considerably enhances LLMs' reasoning abilities across multiple datasets. Alternatively, shortening the reasoning steps, even while preserving the key information, significantly diminishes the reasoning abilities of models. This finding highlights the importance of the number of steps in CoT prompts and provides practical guidance to make better use of LLMs' potential in complex problem-solving scenarios. Second, we also investigated the relationship between the performance of CoT and the rationales used in demonstrations. Surprisingly, the result shows that even incorrect rationales can yield favorable outcomes if they maintain the requisite length of inference. Third, we observed that the advantages of increasing reasoning steps are task-dependent: simpler tasks require fewer steps, whereas complex tasks gain significantly from longer inference sequences.

The cost and impracticality of performing experiments and a recent monumental increase in electronic record keeping has brought attention to the problem of evaluating decisions based on non-experimental observational data. This is the setting of this work. In particular, we study estimation of individual-level causal effects, such as a single patient's response to alternative medication, from recorded contexts, decisions and outcomes. We give generalization bounds on the error in estimated effects based on distance measures between groups receiving different treatments, allowing for sample re-weighting. We provide conditions under which our bound is tight and show how it relates to results for unsupervised domain adaptation. Led by our theoretical results, we devise representation learning algorithms that minimize our bound, by regularizing the representation's induced treatment group distance, and encourage sharing of information between treatment groups. We extend these algorithms to simultaneously learn a weighted representation to further reduce treatment group distances. Finally, an experimental evaluation on real and synthetic data shows the value of our proposed representation architecture and regularization scheme.},

Using data mining techniques, it is possible to make use of and derive benefit from this massive amount of data effectively. We aimed to evaluate validity of data extracted by the Customized eXtraction Program (CXP). METHODS: The CXP extracts and structures data in rapid standardised processes. The CXP was programmed to extract TNF{$\alpha$}-native active ulcerative colitis (UC) patients from EMRs using defined International Classification of Disease-10 (ICD-10) codes. Extracted data were read in parallel with manual assessment of the EMR to compare with CXP-extracted data. RESULTS: From the complete EMR set, 2,802 patients with code K51 (UC) were extracted. Then, CXP extracted 332 patients according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Of these, 97.5\% were correctly identified, resulting in a final set of 320 cases eligible for the study. When comparing CXP-extracted data against manually assessed EMRs, the recovery rate was 95.6-101.1\% over the years with 96.1\% weighted average sensitivity. CONCLUSION: Utilisation of the CXP software can be considered as an effective way to extract relevant EMR data without significant errors. Hence, by extracting from EMRs, CXP accurately identifies patients and has the capacity to facilitate research studies and clinical trials by finding patients with the requested code as well as funnel down itemised individuals according to specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. Beyond this, medical procedures and laboratory data can rapidly be retrieved from the EMRs to create tailored databases of extracted material for immediate use in clinical trials.},

An individual can suffer an undesirable outcome under such decision making systems (e.g. denied credit) irrespective of whether the decision is fair or accurate. Individual recourse pertains to the problem of providing an actionable set of changes a person can undertake in order to improve their outcome. We propose a recourse algorithm that models the underlying data distribution or manifold. We then provide a mechanism to generate the smallest set of changes that will improve an individual's outcome. This mechanism can be easily used to provide recourse for any differentiable machine learning based decision making system. Further, the resulting algorithm is shown to be applicable to both supervised classification and causal decision making systems. Our work attempts to fill gaps in existing fairness literature that have primarily focused on discovering and/or algorithmically enforcing fairness constraints on decision making systems.

In the more general XAI (eXplainable AI) literature, there has been some convergence on explainability meaning model-agnostic techniques that augment a complex model (with internal mechanics intractable for human understanding) with a simpler model argued to deliver results that humans can comprehend. Given the differing usage and intended meaning of the term ``explainability'' in AI and ML, we propose instead to approximate model/algorithm explainability by understandability defined as a function of transparency and interpretability. These concepts are easier to articulate, to ``ground'' in our understanding of how algorithms and models operate and are used more consistently in the literature. We describe the TIFU (Transparency and Interpretability For Understandability) framework and examine how this applies to the landscape of AI/ML in mental health research. We argue that the need for understandablity is heightened in psychiatry because data describing the syndromes, outcomes, disorders and signs/symptoms possess probabilistic relationships to each other---as do the tentative aetiologies and multifactorial social- and psychological-determinants of disorders. If we develop and deploy AI/ML models, ensuring human understandability of the inputs, processes and outputs of these models is essential to develop trustworthy systems fit for deployment.},

Through an enormous experimental effort1--4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence---the structure prediction component of the `protein folding problem'8---has been an important open research problem for more than 50~years9. Despite recent progress10--14, existing methods fall far~short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

Meta-analysis of available DNA methylation datasets requires development of a specific workflow for joint data processing. RESULTS: We propose a comprehensive approach of combined DNA methylation datasets to classify controls and patients. The solution includes data harmonization, construction of machine learning classification models, dimensionality reduction of models, imputation of missing values, and explanation of model predictions by explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) algorithms. We show that harmonization can improve classification accuracy by up to 20\% when preprocessing methods of the training and test datasets are different. The best accuracy results were obtained with tree ensembles, reaching above 95\% for Parkinson's disease. Dimensionality reduction can substantially decrease the number of features, without detriment to the classification accuracy. The best imputation methods achieve almost the same classification accuracy for data with missing values as for the original data. XAI approaches have allowed us to explain model predictions from both populational and individual perspectives. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a methodologically valid and comprehensive approach to the classification of healthy individuals and patients with various diseases based on whole-blood DNA methylation data using Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia as examples. The proposed algorithm works better for the former pathology, characterized by a complex set of symptoms. It allows to solve data harmonization problems for meta-analysis of many different datasets, impute missing values, and build classification models of small dimensionality.},

  abstract = {There are more than 10 million new cases of Alzheimer's patients worldwide each year, which means there is a new case every 3.2 s. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and various machine learning (ML) and image processing methods have been used to detect it. In this study, we used ML methods to classify AD using image and gene expression data. First, SpinalNet and convolutional neural network (CNN) were used to classify AD from MRI images. Then we used microarray gene expression data to classify the diseases using k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector classifier (SVC), and Xboost classifiers. Previous approaches used only either images or gene expression, while we used both data together and also explained the results using trustworthy methods. it was difficult to understand how the classifiers predicted the diseases and genes. It would be useful if the results of these classifiers could be explained in a trustworthy way. To establish trustworthy predictive modeling, we introduced an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) method. The XAI approach we used here is local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) for a simple human interpretation. LIME interprets how genes were predicted and which genes are particularly responsible for an AD patient. The accuracy of CNN is 97.6\%, which is 10.96\% higher than the SpinlNet approach. When analyzing gene expression data, SVC provides higher accuracy than other approaches. LIME shows how genes were selected for a particular AD patient and the most important genes for that patient were determined from the gene expression data.},

  abstract = {AbstractClustering is central to many data-driven bioinformatics research and serves a powerful computational method. In particular, clustering helps at analyzing unstructured and high-dimensional data in the form of sequences, expressions, texts and images. Further, clustering is used to gain insights into biological processes in the genomics level, e.g. clustering of gene expressions provides insights on the natural structure inherent in the data, understanding gene functions, cellular processes, subtypes of cells and understanding gene regulations. Subsequently, clustering approaches, including hierarchical, centroid-based, distribution-based, density-based and self-organizing maps, have long been studied and used in classical machine learning settings. In contrast, deep learning (DL)-based representation and feature learning for clustering have not been reviewed and employed extensively. Since the quality of clustering is not only dependent on the distribution of data points but also on the learned representation, deep neural networks can be effective means to transform mappings from a high-dimensional data space into a lower-dimensional feature space, leading to improved clustering results. In this paper, we review state-of-the-art DL-based approaches for cluster analysis that are based on representation learning, which we hope to be useful, particularly for bioinformatics research. Further, we explore in detail the training procedures of DL-based clustering algorithms, point out different clustering quality metrics and evaluate several DL-based approaches on three bioinformatics use cases, including bioimaging, cancer genomics and biomedical text mining. We believe this review and the evaluation results will provide valuable insights and serve a starting point for researchers wanting to apply DL-based unsupervised methods to solve emerging bioinformatics research problems.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Artificial intelligence (AI) systems utilizing deep neural networks and machine learning (ML) algorithms are widely used for solving critical problems in bioinformatics, biomedical informatics and precision medicine. However, complex ML models that are often perceived as opaque and black-box methods make it difficult to understand the reasoning behind their decisions. This lack of transparency can be a challenge for both end-users and decision-makers, as well as AI developers. In sensitive areas such as healthcare, explainability and accountability are not only desirable properties but also legally required for AI systems that can have a significant impact on human lives. Fairness is another growing concern, as algorithmic decisions should not show bias or discrimination towards certain groups or individuals based on sensitive attributes. Explainable AI (XAI) aims to overcome the opaqueness of black-box models and to provide transparency in how AI systems make decisions. Interpretable ML models can explain how they make predictions and identify factors that influence their outcomes. However, the majority of the state-of-the-art interpretable ML methods are domain-agnostic and have evolved from fields such as computer vision, automated reasoning or statistics, making direct application to bioinformatics problems challenging without customization and domain adaptation. In this paper, we discuss the importance of explainability and algorithmic transparency in the context of bioinformatics. We provide an overview of model-specific and model-agnostic interpretable ML methods and tools and outline their potential limitations. We discuss how existing interpretable ML methods can be customized and fit to bioinformatics research problems. Further, through case studies in bioimaging, cancer genomics and text mining, we demonstrate how XAI methods can improve transparency and decision fairness. Our review aims at providing valuable insights and serving as a starting point for researchers wanting to enhance explainability and decision transparency while solving bioinformatics problems.

However, there are theoretical limitations on the identifiability of underlying structures obtained from observational data alone. Interventional data provides much richer information about the underlying data-generating process. However, the extension and application of methods designed for observational data to include interventions is not straightforward and remains an open problem. In this paper we provide a general framework based on continuous optimization and neural networks to create models for the combination of observational and interventional data. The proposed method is even applicable in the challenging and realistic case that the identity of the intervened upon variable is unknown. We examine the proposed method in the setting of graph recovery both de novo and from a partially-known edge set. We establish strong benchmark results on several structure learning tasks, including structure recovery of both synthetic graphs as well as standard graphs from the Bayesian Network Repository.},

METHODS: In this retrospective study, we built a random survival forest model from clinical data of 203 patients with advanced PDAC. The parameters were assessed before initiation of systemic treatment and included age, CA19-9, C-reactive protein, metastatic status, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and total serum protein level. Separate models including imaging and molecular parameters were built for subgroups. RESULTS: Over the entire cohort, a model based on clinical parameters achieved a c-index of 0.71. Our approach outperformed the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system and the modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS) in the identification of high- and low-risk subgroups. Inclusion of the KRAS p.G12D mutational status could further improve the prediction, whereas radiomics data of the primary tumor only showed little benefit. In an external validation cohort of PDAC patients with liver metastases, our model achieved a c-index of 0.67 (mGPS: 0.59). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of multimodal data and machine-learning algorithms holds potential for personalized prognostication in advanced PDAC already at diagnosis.},

While single-cell sequencing has started to improve our understanding of this heterogeneity, it offers a mostly descriptive view on cellular types and states. To obtain more functional insights, we propose scGeneRAI, an explainable deep learning approach that uses layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) to infer gene regulatory networks from static single-cell RNA sequencing data for individual cells. We benchmark our method with synthetic data and apply it to single-cell RNA sequencing data of a cohort of human lung cancers. From the predicted single-cell networks our approach reveals characteristic network patterns for tumor cells and normal epithelial cells and identifies subnetworks that are observed only in (subgroups of) tumor cells of certain patients. While current state-of-the-art methods are limited by their ability to only predict average networks for cell populations, our approach facilitates the reconstruction of networks down to the level of single cells which can be utilized to characterize the heterogeneity of gene regulation within and across tumors.},

  abstract = {The last decades have seen significant advancements in non-invasive neuroimaging technologies that have been increasingly adopted to examine human brain development. However, these improvements have not necessarily been followed by more sophisticated data analysis measures that are able to explain the mechanisms underlying functional brain development. For example, the shift from univariate (single area in the brain) to multivariate (multiple areas in brain) analysis paradigms is of significance as it allows investigations into the interactions between different brain regions. However, despite the potential of multivariate analysis to shed light on the interactions between developing brain regions, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques applied render the analysis non-explainable. The purpose of this paper is to understand the extent to which current state-of-the-art AI techniques can inform functional brain development. In addition, a review of which AI techniques are more likely to explain their learning based on the processes of brain development as defined by developmental cognitive neuroscience (DCN) frameworks is also undertaken. This work also proposes that eXplainable AI (XAI) may provide viable methods to investigate functional brain development as hypothesized by DCN frameworks.},

We conduct a "behavorial" study of LLMs to benchmark their capability in generating causal arguments. Across a wide range of tasks, we find that LLMs can generate text corresponding to correct causal arguments with high probability, surpassing the best-performing existing methods. Algorithms based on GPT-3.5 and 4 outperform existing algorithms on a pairwise causal discovery task (97\%, 13 points gain), counterfactual reasoning task (92\%, 20 points gain) and event causality (86\% accuracy in determining necessary and sufficient causes in vignettes). We perform robustness checks across tasks and show that the capabilities cannot be explained by dataset memorization alone, especially since LLMs generalize to novel datasets that were created after the training cutoff date. That said, LLMs exhibit unpredictable failure modes, and we discuss the kinds of errors that may be improved and what are the fundamental limits of LLM-based answers. Overall, by operating on the text metadata, LLMs bring capabilities so far understood to be restricted to humans, such as using collected knowledge to generate causal graphs or identifying background causal context from natural language. As a result, LLMs may be used by human domain experts to save effort in setting up a causal analysis, one of the biggest impediments to the widespread adoption of causal methods. Given that LLMs ignore the actual data, our results also point to a fruitful research direction of developing algorithms that combine LLMs with existing causal techniques.

The key idea is to view the high-dimensional internal state of a neural net as an aid, not an obstacle. We show how to use CAVs as part of a technique, Testing with CAVs (TCAV), that uses directional derivatives to quantify the degree to which a user-defined concept is important to a classification result--for example, how sensitive a prediction of "zebra" is to the presence of stripes. Using the domain of image classification as a testing ground, we describe how CAVs may be used to explore hypotheses and generate insights for a standard image classification network as well as a medical application.},

To address this, we undertook multiomic data profiling of chromatin and expression dynamics across epidermal differentiation to identify 40,103 dynamic CREs associated with 3,609 dynamically expressed genes, then applied an interpretable deep-learning framework to model the cis-regulatory logic of chromatin accessibility. This analysis framework identified cooperative DNA sequence rules in dynamic CREs regulating synchronous gene modules with diverse roles in skin differentiation. Massively parallel reporter assay analysis validated temporal dynamics and cooperative cis-regulatory logic. Variants linked to human polygenic skin disease were enriched in these time-dependent combinatorial motif rules.

Artificial intelligence (AI) and, more precisely, deep learning technologies have recently demonstrated the potential to facilitate complex data analysis tasks, including clinical, histological, and molecular data for disease classification; tissue biomarker quantification; and clinical outcome prediction. This review provides a general introduction to AI and describes recent developments with a focus on applications in diagnostic pathology and beyond. We explain limitations including the black-box character of conventional AI and describe solutions to make machine learning decisions more transparent with so-called explainable AI. The purpose of the review is to foster a mutual understanding of both the biomedical and the AI side. To that end, in addition to providing an overview of the relevant foundations in pathology and machine learning, we present worked-through examples for a better practical understanding of what AI can achieve and how it should be done.},

Its use has historically been focused on single modal data. Attempts to improve prediction and mimic the multimodal nature of clinical expert decision-making has been met in the biomedical field of machine learning by fusing disparate data. This review was conducted to summarize the current studies in this field and identify topics ripe for future research. We conducted this review in accordance with the PRISMA extension for Scoping Reviews to characterize multi-modal data fusion in health. Search strings were established and used in databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, and IEEEXplore from 2011 to 2021. A final set of 128 articles were included in the analysis. The most common health areas utilizing multi-modal methods were neurology and oncology. Early fusion was the most common data merging strategy. Notably, there was an improvement in predictive performance when using data fusion. Lacking from the papers were clear clinical deployment strategies, FDA-approval, and analysis of how using multimodal approaches from diverse sub-populations may improve biases and healthcare disparities. These findings provide a summary on multimodal data fusion as applied to health diagnosis/prognosis problems. Few papers compared the outputs of a multimodal approach with a unimodal prediction. However, those that did achieved an average increase of 6.4\% in predictive accuracy. Multi-modal machine learning, while more robust in its estimations over unimodal methods, has drawbacks in its scalability and the time-consuming nature of information concatenation.},

Using three types of explainable methods applied to the same medical image data set, we aimed to improve the comprehensibility of the decisions provided by the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). In vivo gastral images obtained by a video capsule endoscopy (VCE) were the subject of visual explanations, with the goal of increasing health professionals' trust in black-box predictions. We implemented two post hoc interpretable machine learning methods, called Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and an alternative explanation approach, the Contextual Importance and Utility (CIU) method. The produced explanations were assessed by human evaluation. We conducted three user studies based on explanations provided by LIME, SHAP and CIU. Users from different non-medical backgrounds carried out a series of tests in a web-based survey setting and stated their experience and understanding of the given explanations. Three user groups (n = 20, 20, 20) with three distinct forms of explanations were quantitatively analyzed. We found that, as hypothesized, the CIU-explainable method performed better than both LIME and SHAP methods in terms of improving support for human decision-making and being more transparent and thus understandable to users. Additionally, CIU outperformed LIME and SHAP by generating explanations more rapidly. Our findings suggest that there are notable differences in human decision-making between various explanation support settings. In line with that, we present three potential explainable methods that, with future improvements in implementation, can be generalized to different medical data sets and can provide effective decision support to medical experts.},

  abstract = {Introduction               Ovarian Cancer (OC) is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths among women. Despite recent advances in the medical field, such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy interventions, there are only marginal improvements in the diagnosis of OC using clinical parameters, as the symptoms are very non-specific at the early stage. Owing to advances in computational algorithms, such as ensemble machine learning, it is now possible to identify complex patterns in clinical parameters. However, these complex patterns do not provide deeper insights into prediction and diagnosis. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) models, such as LIME and SHAP Kernels, can provide insights into the decision-making process of ensemble models, thus increasing their applicability.                                         Methods               The main aim of this study is to design a computer-aided diagnostic system that accurately classifies and detects ovarian cancer. To achieve this objective, a three-stage ensemble model and a game-theoretic approach based on SHAP values were built to evaluate and visualize the results, thus analyzing the important features responsible for prediction.                                         Results and Discussion                                The results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model with an accuracy of 98.66\%. The proposed model's consistency and advantages are compared with single classifiers. The SHAP values of the proposed model are validated using conventional statistical methods such as the                 p                 -test and Cohen's                 d                 -test to highlight the efficacy of the proposed method. To further validate the ranking of the features, we compared the                 p                 -values and Cohen's                 d                 -values of the top five and bottom five features. The study proposed and validated an AI-based method for the detection, diagnosis, and prognosis of OC using multi-modal real-life data, which mimics the move of a clinician approach with a demonstration of high performance. The proposed strategy can lead to reliable, accurate, and consistent AI solutions for the detection and management of OC with higher patient experience and outcomes at low cost, low morbidity, and low mortality. This can be beneficial for millions of women living in resource-constrained and challenging economies.},

To gain insights into why a DNN makes a given prediction, model interpretability methods, such as attribution methods, can be employed to identify motif-like representations along a given sequence. Because explanations are given on an individual sequence basis and can vary substantially across sequences, deducing generalizable trends across the dataset and quantifying their effect size remains a challenge. Here we introduce global importance analysis (GIA), a model interpretability method that quantifies the population-level effect size that putative patterns have on model predictions. GIA provides an avenue to quantitatively test hypotheses of putative patterns and their interactions with other patterns, as well as map out specific functions the network has learned. As a case study, we demonstrate the utility of GIA on the computational task of predicting RNA-protein interactions from sequence. We first introduce a convolutional network, we call ResidualBind, and benchmark its performance against previous methods on RNAcompete data. Using GIA, we then demonstrate that in addition to sequence motifs, ResidualBind learns a model that considers the number of motifs, their spacing, and sequence context, such as RNA secondary structure and GC-bias.},

These approaches, while effective, come with inherent limitations such as subjectivity in interpretation and constraints in handling complex image features. This research paper proposes an integrated deep learning approach utilizing pre-trained models---VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3---combined within a unified framework to improve diagnostic accuracy in medical imaging. The method focuses on lung cancer detection using images resized and converted to a uniform format to optimize performance and ensure consistency across datasets. Our proposed model leverages the strengths of each pre-trained network, achieving a high degree of feature extraction and robustness by freezing the early convolutional layers and fine-tuning the deeper layers. Additionally, techniques like SMOTE and Gaussian Blur are applied to address class imbalance, enhancing model training on underrepresented classes. The model's performance was validated on the IQ-OTH/NCCD lung cancer dataset, which was collected from the Iraq-Oncology Teaching Hospital/National Center for Cancer Diseases over a period of three months in fall 2019. The proposed model achieved an accuracy of 98.18\%, with precision and recall rates notably high across all classes. This improvement highlights the potential of integrated deep learning systems in medical diagnostics, providing a more accurate, reliable, and efficient means of disease detection.},

Meta-algorithms build on base algorithms---such as Random Forests (RF), Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) or neural networks---to estimate the CATE, a function that the base algorithms are not designed to estimate directly. We introduce a new meta-algorithm, the X-learner, that is provably efficient when the number of units in one treatment group is much larger than in the other, and can exploit structural properties of the CATE function. For example, if the CATE function is linear and the response functions in treatment and control are Lipschitz continuous, the X-learner can still achieve the parametric rate under regularity conditions. We then introduce versions of the X-learner that use RF and BART as base learners. In extensive simulation studies, the X-learner performs favorably, although none of the meta-learners is uniformly the best. In two persuasion field experiments from political science, we demonstrate how our new X-learner can be used to target treatment regimes and to shed light on underlying mechanisms.

This variability makes it difficult to select the most appropriate treatment regimen and predict the progression of the disease. This work was aimed at developing and validating dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) to predict changes of the health status of patients with CLL and progression of the disease over time. Two DBNs were developed and implemented i.e. Health Status Network (HSN) and Treatment Effect Network (TEN). Based on the literature data and expert knowledge we identified relationships linking the most important factors influencing the health status and treatment effects in patients with CLL. The developed networks, and in particular TEN, were able to predict probability of survival in patients with CLL, which was in line with the survival data collected in large medical registries. The networks can be used to personalize the predictions, taking into account a priori knowledge concerning a particular patient with CLL. The proposed approach can serve as a basis for the development of artificial intelligence systems that facilitate the choice of treatment that maximizes the chances of survival in patients with CLL.},

Here, motivated by emerging biomedical questions, we propose a deep neural architecture for learning causal relationships between variables from a combination of high-dimensional data and prior causal knowledge. We combine convolutional and graph neural networks within a causal risk framework to provide an approach that is demonstrably effective under the conditions of high dimensionality, noise and data limitations that are characteristic of many applications, including in large-scale biology. In experiments, we find that the proposed learners can effectively identify novel causal relationships across thousands of variables. Results include extensive (linear and nonlinear) simulations (where the ground truth is known and can be directly compared against), as well as real biological examples where the models are applied to high-dimensional molecular data and their outputs compared against entirely unseen validation experiments.

  abstract = {Recent progress in artificial intelligence (AI) has renewed interest in building systems that learn and think like people. Many advances have come from using deep neural networks trained end-to-end in tasks such as object recognition, video games, and board games, achieving performance that equals or even beats humans in some respects. Despite their biological inspiration and performance achievements, these systems differ from human intelligence in crucial ways. We review progress in cognitive science suggesting that truly human-like learning and thinking machines will have to reach beyond current engineering trends in both what they learn, and how they learn it. Specifically, we argue that these machines should (a) build causal models of the world that support explanation and understanding, rather than merely solving pattern recognition problems; (b) ground learning in intuitive theories of physics and psychology, to support and enrich the knowledge that is learned; and (c) harness compositionality and learning-to-learn to rapidly acquire and generalize knowledge to new tasks and situations. We suggest concrete challenges and promising routes towards these goals that can combine the strengths of recent neural network advances with more structured cognitive models.},

RESULTS: We develop, apply, and comparatively evaluate an automated machine learning (AutoML) approach, customized for genomic data that delivers reliable predictive and diagnostic models, the set of genetic variants that are important for predictions (called a biosignature), and an estimate of the out-of-sample predictive power. This AutoML approach discovers variants with higher predictive performance compared to standard GWAS methods, computes an individual risk prediction score, generalizes to new, unseen data, is shown to better differentiate causal variants from other highly correlated variants, and enhances knowledge discovery and interpretability by reporting multiple equivalent biosignatures.

Quantum-enhanced Monte Carlo simulations, employing algorithms such as Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) and Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), achieve computational speedups of 8--15 times compared to classical methods while maintaining high accuracy. The deep learning architecture leverages convolutional and recurrent neural networks to capture complex anatomical and dosimetric patterns. Validation on simulated datasets demonstrates a 50--70\% reduction in mean absolute error and 2--3\% improvements in gamma index metrics compared to conventional approaches. Dose-volume histogram analysis further highlights enhanced Dice coefficients and reduced Hausdorff distances. These advancements underscore the potential for precise, efficient, and clinically relevant dose estimations, paving the way for improved outcomes in personalized adaptive radiotherapy.},

  abstract = {Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) is a form of analogical reasoning in which the solution for a (new) query case is determined using a database of previous known cases with their solutions. Cases similar to the query are retrieved from the database, and then their solutions are adapted to the query. In medicine, a case usually corresponds to a patient and the problem consists of classifying the patient in a class of diagnostic or therapy. Compared to ``black box'' algorithms such as deep learning, the responses of CBR systems can be justified easily using the similar cases as examples. However, this possibility is often under-exploited and the explanations provided by most CBR systems are limited to the display of the similar cases. In this paper, we propose a CBR method that can be both executed automatically as an algorithm and presented visually in a user interface for providing visual explanations or for visual reasoning. After retrieving similar cases, a visual interface displays quantitative and qualitative similarities between the query and the similar cases, so as one can easily classify the query through visual reasoning, in a fully explainable manner. It combines a quantitative approach (visualized by a scatter plot based on Multidimensional Scaling in polar coordinates, preserving distances involving the query) and a qualitative approach (set visualization using rainbow boxes). We applied this method to breast cancer management. We showed on three public datasets that our qualitative method has a classification accuracy comparable to k-Nearest Neighbors algorithms, but is better explainable. We also tested the proposed interface during a small user study. Finally, we apply the proposed approach to a real dataset in breast cancer. Medical experts found the visual approach interesting as it explains why cases are similar through the visualization of shared patient characteristics.},

Early clinical prediction is typically based on manually calculated screening metrics that simply weigh these parameters, such as early warning scores (EWS). The predictive performance of EWSs yields a tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity that can lead to negative outcomes for the patient. Previous work on electronic health records (EHR) trained artificial intelligence (AI) systems offers promising results with high levels of predictive performance in relation to the early, real-time prediction of acute critical illness. However, without insight into the complex decisions by such system, clinical translation is hindered. Here, we present an explainable AI early warning score (xAI-EWS) system for early detection of acute critical illness. xAI-EWS potentiates clinical translation by accompanying a prediction with information on the EHR data explaining it.},

The study was conducted to validate the performance of the two technologies in chest X-ray reading and explore their potential applications in the medical imaging diagnosis domain. The study methodology consisted of randomly selecting 2000 chest X-ray images from a single institution's patient database, and two radiologists evaluated the readings provided by KARA-CXR and ChatGPT. The study used five qualitative factors to evaluate the readings generated by each model: accuracy, false findings, location inaccuracies, count inaccuracies, and hallucinations. Statistical analysis showed that KARA-CXR achieved significantly higher diagnostic accuracy compared to ChatGPT. In the `Acceptable' accuracy category, KARA-CXR was rated at 70.50\% and 68.00\% by two observers, while ChatGPT achieved 40.50\% and 47.00\%. Interobserver agreement was moderate for both systems, with KARA at 0.74 and GPT4 at 0.73. For `False Findings', KARA-CXR scored 68.00\% and 68.50\%, while ChatGPT scored 37.00\% for both observers, with high interobserver agreements of 0.96 for KARA and 0.97 for GPT4. In `Location Inaccuracy' and `Hallucinations', KARA-CXR outperformed ChatGPT with significant margins. KARA-CXR demonstrated a non-hallucination rate of 75\%, which is significantly higher than ChatGPT's 38\%. The interobserver agreement was high for KARA (0.91) and moderate to high for GPT4 (0.85) in the hallucination category. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the potential of AI and large-scale language models in medical imaging and diagnostics. It also shows that in the chest X-ray domain, KARA-CXR has relatively higher accuracy than ChatGPT.},

With the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2019, we aimed to develop and validate a machine learning algorithm with high prediction performance and clinical interpretability for prediction of sepsis onset during critical care in real-time. DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort study. SETTING: The dataset was collected from three ICUs in three different U.S. hospitals. Two of them were publicly available for model development (offline) and one was used for testing (online). PATIENTS: Forty-thousand three-hundred thirty-six ICU patients from the two model development databases and 24,819 from the test database. There are up to 40 hourly-recorded clinical variables for each ICU stay. The Sepsis-3 criteria were used to confirm sepsis onset. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Three-hundred twelve features were constructed hourly as the input of our proposed Time-phAsed machine learning model for Sepsis Prediction. Time-phAsed machine learning model for Sepsis Prediction first estimates the likelihood of sepsis onset for each hour of an ICU stay in the following 6 hours, and then makes a binary prediction with three time-phased cutoff values. On the internal validation set, the utility score (official challenge measurement) achieved by Time-phAsed machine learning model for Sepsis Prediction was 0.430. On the test set, the utility score reached was 0.354. Furthermore, Time-phAsed machine learning model for Sepsis Prediction provides an intuitive way to illustrate the impact of the input features on the outcome prediction, which makes it clinically interpretable. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed Time-phAsed machine learning model for Sepsis Prediction model is accurate and interpretable for real-time prediction of sepsis onset in critical care, which holds great potential for further evaluation in prospective studies.},

However, existing pre-trained models lack of causal knowledge which prevents today's NLP systems from thinking like humans. In this paper, we investigate the problem of injecting causal knowledge into pre-trained models. There are two fundamental problems: 1) how to collect various granularities of causal pairs from unstructured texts; 2) how to effectively inject causal knowledge into pre-trained models. To address these issues, we extend the idea of CausalBERT from previous studies, and conduct experiments on various datasets to evaluate its effectiveness. In addition, we adopt a regularization-based method to preserve the already learned knowledge with an extra regularization term while injecting causal knowledge. Extensive experiments on 7 datasets, including four causal pair classification tasks, two causal QA tasks and a causal inference task, demonstrate that CausalBERT captures rich causal knowledge and outperforms all pre-trained models-based state-of-the-art methods, achieving a new causal inference benchmark.},

WSI classification can be cast as a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem when only slide-level labels are available. We propose a MILbased method for WSI classification and tumor detection that does not require localized annotations. Our method has three major components. First, we introduce a novel MIL aggregator that models the relations of the instances in a dual-stream architecture with trainable distance measurement. Second, since WSIs can produce large or unbalanced bags that hinder the training of MIL models, we propose to use self-supervised contrastive learning to extract good representations for MIL and alleviate the issue of prohibitive memory cost for large bags. Third, we adopt a pyramidal fusion mechanism for multiscale WSI features, and further improve the accuracy of classification and localization. Our model is evaluated on two representative WSI datasets. The classification accuracy of our model compares favorably to fully-supervised methods, with less than 2\% accuracy gap across datasets. Our results also outperform all previous MIL-based methods. Additional benchmark results on standard MIL datasets further demonstrate the superior performance of our MIL aggregator on general MIL problems.},

  abstract = {We are witnessing a fast development of Artificial Intelligence (AI), but it becomes dramatically challenging to explain AI models in the past decade. ``Explanation'' has a flexible philosophical concept of ``satisfying the subjective curiosity for causal information'', driving a wide spectrum of methods being invented and/or adapted from many aspects and communities, including machine learning, visual analytics, human-computer interaction and so on. Nevertheless, from the view-point of data and knowledge engineering (DKE), a best explaining practice that is cost-effective in terms of extra intelligence acquisition should exploit the causal information and explaining scenarios which is hidden richly in the data itself. In the past several years, there are plenty of works contributing in this line but there is a lack of a clear taxonomy and systematic review of the current effort. To this end, we propose this survey, reviewing and taxonomizing existing efforts from the view-point of DKE, summarizing their contribution, technical essence and comparative characteristics. Specifically, we categorize methods into data-driven methods where explanation comes from the task-related data, and knowledge-aware methods where extraneous knowledge is incorporated. Furthermore, in the light of practice, we provide survey of state-of-art evaluation metrics and deployed explanation applications in industrial practice.},

  abstract = {Federated learning (FL) aims to collaboratively train the global model in a distributed manner by sharing the model parameters from local clients to a central server, thereby potentially protecting users' private information. Nevertheless, recent studies have illustrated that FL still suffers from information leakage as adversaries try to recover the training data by analyzing shared parameters from local clients. To deal with this issue, differential privacy (DP) is adopted to add noise to the gradients of local models before aggregation. It, however, results in the poor performance of gradient-based interpretability methods, since some weights capturing the salient region in feature map will be perturbed. To overcome this problem, we propose a simple yet effective adaptive differential privacy (ADP) mechanism that selectively adds noisy perturbations to the gradients of client models in FL. We also theoretically analyze the impact of gradient perturbation on the model interpretability. Finally, extensive experiments on both IID and Non-IID data demonstrate that the proposed ADP can achieve a good trade-off between privacy and interpretability in FL.},

  abstract = {We propose causal recurrent variational autoencoder (CR-VAE), a novel generative model that is able to learn a Granger causal graph from a multivariate time series x and incorporates the underlying causal mechanism into its data generation process. Distinct to the classical recurrent VAEs, our CR-VAE uses a multi-head decoder, in which the \$p\$-th head is responsible for generating the \$p\$-th dimension of \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{x\}\$ (i.e., \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{x\}{\textasciicircum}p\$). By imposing a sparsity-inducing penalty on the weights (of the decoder) and encouraging specific sets of weights to be zero, our CR-VAE learns a sparse adjacency matrix that encodes causal relations between all pairs of variables. Thanks to this causal matrix, our decoder strictly obeys the underlying principles of Granger causality, thereby making the data generating process transparent. We develop a two-stage approach to train the overall objective. Empirically, we evaluate the behavior of our model in synthetic data and two real-world human brain datasets involving, respectively, the electroencephalography (EEG) signals and the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art time series generative models both qualitatively and quantitatively. Moreover, it also discovers a faithful causal graph with similar or improved accuracy over existing Granger causality-based causal inference methods.

This paper reviews the deep learning attention methods in medical image analysis. A comprehensive literature survey is first conducted to analyze the keywords and literature.

Among the many inflammatory markers, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and systemic immune-inflammatory index (SII) were considered as novel predictors for atherosclerosis outcomes. We aimed to investigate the impact of these inflammatory markers on the prognosis of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Methods We obtained data on AF patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. These patients were classified into two groups based on their survival status within 30~days. Then, they were divided into three groups based on the tertile of baseline NLR, PLR, and SII, respectively. We comprehensively explored the relationship between those inflammatory indicators and all-cause mortality in patients with AF by Kaplan-Meier analysis, multivariate Cox regression analysis, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses, restricted cubic spline regression (RCS), and subgroup analysis. Results A total of 4562 patients with AF were included. Statistically significant differences were found between survivor and non-survivor groups for NLR, PLR and SII. Patients in the high tertile of the NLR had a higher mortality rate than those in the low and intermediate tertiles, as did patients in the PLR and the SII. NLR, PLR and SII were independently associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality. RCS showed that the 30-day and 365-day risk of death were linearly associated with increases in NLR, PLR, and SII, respectively. Conclusion NLR, PLR, and SII have the potential to be used as indicators for stratifying the risk of mortality in critically ill patients with AF.},

  abstract = {Introduction               The early prediction of sepsis based on machine learning or deep learning has achieved good results.Most of the methods use structured data stored in electronic medical records, but the pathological characteristics of sepsis involve complex interactions between multiple physiological systems and signaling pathways, resulting in mixed structured data. Some researchers will introduce unstructured data when also introduce confounders. These confounders mask the direct causality of sepsis, leading the model to learn misleading correlations. Finally, it affects the generalization ability, robustness, and interpretability of the model.                                         Methods               To address this challenge, we propose an early sepsis prediction approach based on causal inference which can remove confounding effects and capture causal relationships. First, we analyze the relationship between each type of observation, confounder, and label to create a causal structure diagram. To eliminate the effects of different confounders separately, the methods of back-door adjustment and instrumental variable are used. Specifically, we learn the confounder and an instrumental variable based on mutual information from various observed data and eliminate the influence of the confounder by optimizing mutual information. We use back-door adjustment to eliminate the influence of confounders in clinical notes and static indicators on the true causal effect.                                         Results               Our method, named CISepsis, was validated on the MIMIC-IV dataset. Compared to existing state-of-the-art early sepsis prediction models such as XGBoost, LSTM, and MGP-AttTCN, our method demonstrated a significant improvement in AUC. Specifically, our model achieved AUC values of 0.921, 0.920, 0.919, 0.923, 0.924, 0.926, and 0.926 at the 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0 time points, respectively. Furthermore, the effectiveness of our method was confirmed through ablation experiments.                                         Discussion               Our method, based on causal inference, effectively removes the influence of confounding factors, significantly improving the predictive accuracy of the model. Compared to traditional methods, this adjustment allows for a more accurate capture of the true causal effects of sepsis, thereby enhancing the model's generalizability, robustness, and interpretability. Future research will explore the impact of specific indicators or treatment interventions on sepsis using counterfactual adjustments in causal inference, as well as investigate the potential clinical application of our method.},

In a retrospective evaluation, the LLM module demonstrated comparable performance to PCPs and endocrinology residents when tested in English and outperformed PCPs and had comparable performance to endocrinology residents in Chinese. For identifying referable DR, the average PCP's accuracy was 81.0\% unassisted and 92.3\% assisted by DeepDR-Transformer. Furthermore, we performed a single-center real-world prospective study, deploying DeepDR-LLM. We compared diabetes management adherence of patients under the unassisted PCP arm (n\,=\,397) with those under the PCP+DeepDR-LLM arm (n\,=\,372). Patients with newly diagnosed diabetes in the PCP+DeepDR-LLM arm showed better self-management behaviors throughout follow-up (P\,{$<$}\,0.05). For patients with referral DR, those in the PCP+DeepDR-LLM arm were more likely to adhere to DR referrals (P\,{$<$}\,0.01). Additionally, DeepDR-LLM deployment improved the quality and empathy level of management recommendations. Given its multifaceted performance, DeepDR-LLM holds promise as a digital solution for enhancing primary diabetes care and DR screening.},

Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis was performed on periodontitis datasets GSE16134 and GSE10334 from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, followed by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify relevant gene modules. Various machine learning algorithms were utilized to construct predictive models, highlighting core genes, while MR assessed the causal relationships between these genes and periodontitis. Additionally, immune infiltration analysis and single-cell sequencing were employed to explore the roles of key genes in immunity and their expression across different cell types. The integration of machine learning, MR, and single-cell sequencing represents a novel approach that significantly enhances our understanding of the immune dynamics and gene interactions in periodontitis. The study identified 682 significant DEGs, with WGCNA revealing seven gene modules associated with periodontitis and 471 core candidate genes. Among the 113 machine learning algorithms tested, XGBoost was the most effective in identifying periodontitis samples, leading to the selection of 19 core genes. MR confirmed significant causal relationships between CD93, CD69, and CXCL6 and periodontitis. Further analysis showed that these genes were correlated with various immune cells and exhibited specific expression patterns in periodontitis tissues. The findings suggest that CD93, CD69, and CXCL6 are closely related to the progression of periodontitis, with MR confirming their causal links to the disease. These genes have potential applications in the diagnosis and treatment of periodontitis, offering new insights into the disease's molecular mechanisms and providing valuable resources for precision medicine approaches in periodontitis management. Limitations of this study include the demographic and sample size constraints of the datasets, which may impact the generalizability of the findings. Future research is needed to validate these biomarkers in larger, diverse cohorts and to investigate their functional roles in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.},

We develop an advanced multi-view graph-level representation learning (MGRL) framework that integrates prior biological network information, to build molecular aging clocks at cell-type resolution, which we subsequently interpret using XAI. We apply this framework to one of the largest single-cell transcriptomic datasets encompassing over a million immune cells from 981 donors, revealing a ribosomal gene subnetwork, whose expression correlates with age independently of cell-type. Application of the same DL-XAI framework to DNA methylation data of sorted monocytes reveals an epigenetically deregulated inflammatory response pathway whose activity increases with age. We show that the ribosomal module and inflammatory pathways would not have been discovered had we used more standard machine-learning methods.

  abstract = {Cellular anatomy and signaling vary across niches, which can induce gradated gene expressions in subpopulations of cells. Such spatial transcriptomic gradient (STG) makes a significant source of intratumor heterogeneity and can influence tumor invasion, progression, and response to treatment. Here we report Local Spatial Gradient Inference (LSGI), a computational framework that systematically identifies spatial locations with prominent, interpretable STGs from spatial transcriptomic (ST) data. To achieve so, LSGI scrutinizes each sliding window employing non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) combined with linear regression. With LSGI, we demonstrated the identification of spatially proximal yet opposite directed pathway gradients in a glioblastoma dataset. We further applied LSGI to 87 tumor ST datasets reported from nine published studies and identified both pan-cancer and tumor-type specific pathways with gradated expression patterns, such as epithelial mesenchymal transition, MHC complex, and hypoxia. The local gradients were further categorized according to their association to tumor-TME (tumor microenvironment) interface, highlighting the pathways related to spatial transcriptional intratumoral heterogeneity. We conclude that LSGI enables highly interpretable STG analysis which can reveal novel insights in tumor biology from the increasingly reported tumor ST datasets.},

  abstract = {In single-cell transcriptomics research, accurately predicting cell lineage allocation and identifying differences between lineages are crucial for understanding cell differentiation processes and reducing early pregnancy miscarriages in humans. This paper introduces an explainable PCA-based deep learning attention autoencoder model, X-scPAE (eXplained Single Cell PCA - Attention Auto Encoder), which is built on the Counterfactual Gradient Attribution (CGA) algorithm. The model is designed to predict lineage allocation in human and mouse single-cell transcriptomic data, while identifying and interpreting gene expression differences across lineages to extract key genes. It first reduces dimensionality using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and ranks the importance of principal components. An autoencoder is then employed for feature extraction, integrating an attention mechanism to capture interactions between features. Finally, the Counterfactual Gradient Attribution algorithm calculates the importance of each feature. The model achieved an accuracy of 0.945 on the test set and 0.977 on the validation set, with other metrics such as F1-score, Precision, and Recall all reaching 0.94. It significantly outperformed both baseline algorithms (XGBoost, SVM, RF, and LR) and advanced approaches like F-Score-SVM, CV2-LR, scChrBin, and TripletCell. Notably, the explainability analysis uncovered key lineage predictor genes for both humans and mice and identified crucial genes distinguishing between developmental stages and lineages. A logistic regression model built using the extracted key genes still achieved an AUROC of 0.92, surpassing the performance of other feature extraction methods, including F-Score, CV2, PCA, random feature selection, and the interpretability method Shapley. Lastly, ablation studies demonstrated the effectiveness of each model component.},

However, it remains challenging to quantify the correctness of their interpretability as current evaluation approaches either require subjective input from humans or incur high computation cost with automated evaluation. In this paper, we propose backdoor trigger patterns--hidden malicious functionalities that cause misclassification--to automate the evaluation of saliency explanations. Our key observation is that triggers provide ground truth for inputs to evaluate whether the regions identified by an XAI method are truly relevant to its output. Since backdoor triggers are the most important features that cause deliberate misclassification, a robust XAI method should reveal their presence at inference time. We introduce three complementary metrics for the systematic evaluation of explanations that an XAI method generates. We evaluate seven state-of-the-art model-free and model-specific post-hoc methods through 36 models trojaned with specifically crafted triggers using color, shape, texture, location, and size. We found six methods that use local explanation and feature relevance fail to completely highlight trigger regions, and only a model-free approach can uncover the entire trigger region.

However, this surge in performance, has often been achieved through increased model complexity, turning such systems into ``black box'' approaches and causing uncertainty regarding the way they operate and, ultimately, the way that they come to decisions. This ambiguity has made it problematic for machine learning systems to be adopted in sensitive yet critical domains, where their value could be immense, such as healthcare. As a result, scientific interest in the field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), a field that is concerned with the development of new methods that explain and interpret machine learning models, has been tremendously reignited over recent years.

Multi-modal imaging data have been increasingly used in MCBR, as they could provide more insights of the diseases and complement the deficiencies of single-modal data. However, it is very challenging to fuse data in different modalities since they have different physical fundamentals and large value range variations. In this study, we propose a novel Propagation Graph Fusion (PGF) framework for multi-modal medical data retrieval. PGF models the subjects' relationships in single modalities using the directed propagation graphs, and then fuses the graphs into a single graph by summing up the edge weights. Our proposed PGF method could reduce the large inter-modality and inter-subject variations, and can be solved efficiently using the PageRank algorithm. We test the proposed method on a public medical database with 331 subjects using features extracted from two imaging modalities, PET and MRI. The preliminary results show that our PGF method could enhance multi-modal retrieval and modestly outperform the state-of-the-art single-modal and multi-modal retrieval methods.},

To tackle this problem, we apply the Knowledge Distillation technique to distill Deep Neural Networks into decision trees in order to attain good performance and interpretability simultaneously. We formulate the problem at hand as a multi-output regression problem and the experiments demonstrate that the student model achieves significantly better accuracy performance (about 1{\textbackslash}\% to 5{\textbackslash}\%) than vanilla decision trees at the same level of tree depth. The experiments are implemented on the TensorFlow platform to make it scalable to big datasets.

  abstract = {As an information carrier, face images contain abundant sensitive information. Due to its natural weak privacy, direct publishing may divulge privacy. Anonymization Technology and Data Encryption Technology are limited by the background knowledge and attack means of attackers, which cannot completely content the needs of face image privacy protection. Therefore, this paper proposes a face image publishing SWP (sliding window publication) algorithm, which satisfies the differential privacy. Firstly, the SWP translates the image gray matrix into a one-dimensional ordered data stream by using image segmentation technology. The purpose of this step is to transform the image privacy protection problem into the data stream privacy protection problem. Then, the sliding window model is used to model the data flow. By comparing the similarity of data in adjacent sliding windows, the privacy budget is dynamically allocated, and Laplace noise is added. In SWP, the data in the sliding window comes from the image. To present the image features contained in the data more comprehensively and use the privacy budget more reasonably, this paper proposes a fusion similarity measurement EM (exact mechanism) mechanism and a dynamic privacy budget allocation DA (dynamic allocation) mechanism. Also, for further improving the usability of human face images and reducing the impact of noise, a sort-SWP algorithm based on the SWP method is proposed in the paper. Through the analysis, it can be seen that ordered input can further improve the usability of the SWP algorithm, but direct sorting of data will destroy the               {$\varepsilon$}               -differential privacy.

And then an approximate correct sort is obtained by using the Annealing algorithm to optimize the initial sort. Compared with LAP algorithm and SWP algorithm, the average accuracy rate of sort-SWP algorithm in ORL, Yale is increased by 56.63\% and 21.55\%, the recall rate is increased by 6.85\% and 3.32\%, and F1-sroce is improved by 55.62\% and 16.55\%.},

While at clinical deployment, the models trained in federated learning can still suffer from performance drop when applied to completely unseen hospitals outside the federation. In this paper, we point out and solve a novel problem setting of federated domain generalization (FedDG), which aims to learn a federated model from multiple distributed source domains such that it can directly generalize to unseen target domains. We present a novel approach, named as Episodic Learning in Continuous Frequency Space (ELCFS), for this problem by enabling each client to exploit multi-source data distributions under the challenging constraint of data decentralization. Our approach transmits the distribution information across clients in a privacy-protecting way through an effective continuous frequency space interpolation mechanism. With the transferred multi-source distributions, we further carefully design a boundary-oriented episodic learning paradigm to expose the local learning to domain distribution shifts and particularly meet the challenges of model generalization in medical image segmentation scenario. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated with superior performance over state-of-the-arts and in-depth ablation experiments on two medical image segmentation tasks.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly being developed to support clinical decisions for better health service quality, but the adoption of AI in hospitals is not as popular as expected. A possible reason is that the unclear AI explainability (XAI) affects the physicians' consideration of adopting the model. PURPOSE: To propose and validate an innovative conceptual model aimed at exploring physicians' intention to use AI with XAI as an antecedent variable of technology trust (TT) and perceived value (PV). METHODS: A questionnaire survey was conducted to collect data from physicians of three hospitals in Taiwan. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to validate the proposed model and test the hypotheses. RESULTS: A total of 295 valid questionnaires were collected. The research results showed that physicians expressed a high intention to use AI. The XAI was found to be of great importance and had a significant impact both on AI TT and PV. We also observed that TT in AI had a significant impact on PV. Moreover, physicians' PV and TT in AI had a significant impact on their behavioral intention to use AI (BI). However, XAI's impact on BI cannot be proved. CONCLUSIONS: The conceptual model developed in this study provides empirical evidence that could be used as guidelines to effectively explore physicians' intention to use medical AI from the antecedent of XAI. Our findings contribute crucial AI-human interaction insights in health care studies.},

  abstract = {Building an accurate disease risk prediction model is an essential step in the modern quest for precision medicine. While high-dimensional genomic data provides valuable data resources for the investigations of disease risk, their huge amount of noise and complex relationships between predictors and outcomes have brought tremendous analytical challenges. Deep learning model is the state-of-the-art methods for many prediction tasks, and it is a promising framework for the analysis of genomic data. However, deep learning models generally suffer from the curse of dimensionality and the lack of biological interpretability, both of which have greatly limited their applications. In this work, we have developed a deep neural network (DNN) based prediction modeling framework. We first proposed a group-wise feature importance score for feature selection, where genes harboring genetic variants with both linear and non-linear effects are efficiently detected. We then designed an explainable transfer-learning based DNN method, which can directly incorporate information from feature selection and accurately capture complex predictive effects. The proposed DNN-framework is biologically interpretable, as it is built based on the selected predictive genes. It is also computationally efficient and can be applied to genome-wide data. Through extensive simulations and real data analyses, we have demonstrated that our proposed method can not only efficiently detect predictive features, but also accurately predict disease risk, as compared to many existing methods.},

Yet this remains challenging without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on costly chain-of-thought (CoT) data distilled from closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o). In this work, we present AlphaMed, the first medical LLM to show that reasoning capability can emerge purely through reinforcement learning (RL), using minimalist rule-based rewards on public multiple-choice QA datasets, without relying on SFT or distilled CoT data. AlphaMed achieves state-of-the-art results on six medical QA benchmarks, outperforming models trained with conventional SFT+RL pipelines. On challenging benchmarks (e.g., MedXpert), AlphaMed even surpasses larger or closed-source models such as DeepSeek-V3-671B and Claude-3.5-Sonnet. To understand the factors behind this success, we conduct a comprehensive data-centric analysis guided by three questions: (i) Can minimalist rule-based RL incentivize reasoning without distilled CoT supervision? (ii) How do dataset quantity and diversity impact reasoning? (iii) How does question difficulty shape the emergence and generalization of reasoning? Our findings show that dataset informativeness is a key driver of reasoning performance, and that minimalist RL on informative, multiple-choice QA data is effective at inducing reasoning without CoT supervision. We also observe divergent trends across benchmarks, underscoring limitations in current evaluation and the need for more challenging, reasoning-oriented medical QA benchmarks.},

While existing analytical research suggests that neural networks tend to learn low-frequency features, a clear attribution method for identifying the specific learned Fourier features has remained elusive. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Fourier feature attribution method grounded in signal decomposition theory. Additionally, we analyze the differences between game-theoretic attribution metrics for Fourier and spatial domain features, demonstrating that game-theoretic evaluation metrics are better suited for Fourier-based feature attribution. Our experiments show that Fourier feature attribution exhibits superior feature selection capabilities compared to spatial domain attribution methods. For instance, in the case of Vision Transformers (ViTs) on the ImageNet dataset, only \$8{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the Fourier features are required to maintain the original predictions for \$80{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the samples. Furthermore, we compare the specificity of features identified by our method against traditional spatial domain attribution methods. Results reveal that Fourier features exhibit greater intra-class concentration and inter-class distinctiveness, indicating their potential for more efficient classification and explainable AI algorithms.},

Further ablation studies indicate the effectiveness of key components in our medical LLM training approach.

  abstract = {The recommendation of medication is a vital aspect of intelligent healthcare systems, as it involves prescribing the most suitable drugs based on a patient's specific health needs. Unfortunately, many sophisticated models currently in use tend to overlook the nuanced semantics of medical data, while only relying heavily on identities. Furthermore, these models face significant challenges in handling cases involving patients who are visiting the hospital for the first time, as they lack prior prescription histories to draw upon. To tackle these issues, we harness the powerful semantic comprehension and input-agnostic characteristics of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our research aims to transform existing medication recommendation methodologies using LLMs. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Large Language Model Distilling Medication Recommendation (LEADER). We begin by creating appropriate prompt templates that enable LLMs to suggest medications effectively. However, the straightforward integration of LLMs into recommender systems leads to an out-of-corpus issue specific to drugs. We handle it by adapting the LLMs with a novel output layer and a refined tuning loss function. Although LLM-based models exhibit remarkable capabilities, they are plagued by high computational costs during inference, which is impractical for the healthcare sector. To mitigate this, we have developed a feature-level knowledge distillation technique, which transfers the LLM's proficiency to a more compact model. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets, MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV, demonstrate that our proposed model not only delivers effective results but also is efficient. To ease the reproducibility of our experiments, we release the implementation code online.},

However, training on large-scale corpora often fails to effectively organize domain knowledge of LLMs, leading to fragmented understanding. Inspired by how humans connect concepts and organize knowledge through mind maps, we aim to emulate this approach by using ontology with hierarchical conceptual knowledge to reorganize LLM's domain knowledge. From this perspective, we propose an ontology-driven self-training framework called OntoTune, which aims to align LLMs with ontology through in-context learning, enabling the generation of responses guided by the ontology. We leverage in-context learning to identify whether the LLM has acquired the specific concept's ontology knowledge, and select the entries not yet mastered by LLM as the training set to further align the LLM with ontology. Compared to existing domain LLMs based on newly collected large-scale domain-specific corpora, our OntoTune, which relies on the existing, long-term developed ontology and LLM itself, significantly reduces data maintenance costs and offers improved generalization ability. We conduct our study in the medical domain to evaluate the effectiveness of OntoTune, utilizing a standardized medical ontology, SNOMED CT as our ontology source. Experimental results demonstrate that OntoTune achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-ontology task hypernym discovery and out-of-ontology task medical domain QA. Moreover, compared to the latest direct ontology injection method TaxoLLaMA, our OntoTune better preserves original knowledge of LLM.

Skill learning is the most common application of machine learning algorithms in clinical decision making.

  abstract = {Nowadays, in the international scientific community of machine learning, there exists an enormous discussion about the use of black-box models or explainable models; especially in practical problems. On the one hand, a part of the community defends that black-box models are more accurate than explainable models in some contexts, like image preprocessing. On the other hand, there exist another part of the community alleging that explainable models are better than black-box models because they can obtain comparable results and also they can explain these results in a language close to a human expert by using patterns. In this paper, advantages and weaknesses for each approach are shown; taking into account a state-of-the-art review for both approaches, their practical applications, trends, and future challenges. This paper shows that both approaches are suitable for solving practical problems, but experts in machine learning need to understand the input data, the problem to solve, and the best way for showing the output data before applying a machine learning model.

We define a general benchmark to quantify gender bias in a variety of neural NLP tasks. Our empirical evaluation with state-of-the-art neural coreference resolution and textbook RNN-based language models trained on benchmark datasets finds significant gender bias in how models view occupations. We then mitigate bias with CDA: a generic methodology for corpus augmentation via causal interventions that breaks associations between gendered and gender-neutral words. We empirically show that CDA effectively decreases gender bias while preserving accuracy. We also explore the space of mitigation strategies with CDA, a prior approach to word embedding debiasing (WED), and their compositions. We show that CDA outperforms WED, drastically so when word embeddings are trained. For pre-trained embeddings, the two methods can be effectively composed. We also find that as training proceeds on the original data set with gradient descent the gender bias grows as the loss reduces, indicating that the optimization encourages bias; CDA mitigates this behavior.},

Additionally, most models in histopathology leverage only image data, a stark contrast to how humans teach each other and reason about histopathologic entities. We introduce CONtrastive learning from Captions for Histopathology (CONCH), a visual-language foundation model developed using diverse sources of histopathology images, biomedical text, and notably over 1.17 million image-caption pairs via task-agnostic pretraining. Evaluated on a suite of 13 diverse benchmarks, CONCH can be transferred to a wide range of downstream tasks involving either or both histopathology images and text, achieving state-of-the-art performance on histology image classification, segmentation, captioning, text-to-image and image-to-text retrieval.

Traditional machine learning and deep learning models have achieved notable success in this domain but often lack interpretability which is a crucial requirement in clinical settings. In this study, we explore the use of neuro-symbolic methods, specifically Logical Neural Networks (LNNs), to develop explainable models for diagnosis prediction. Essentially, we design and implement LNN-based models that integrate domain-specific knowledge through logical rules with learnable thresholds. Our models, particularly \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{multi-pathway\}\}\$ and \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{comprehensive\}\}\$, demonstrate superior performance over traditional models such as Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest, achieving higher accuracy (up to 80.52{\textbackslash}\%) and AUROC scores (up to 0.8457) in the case study of diabetes prediction. The learned weights and thresholds within the LNN models provide direct insights into feature contributions, enhancing interpretability without compromising predictive power. These findings highlight the potential of neuro-symbolic approaches in bridging the gap between accuracy and explainability in healthcare AI applications. By offering transparent and adaptable diagnostic models, our work contributes to the advancement of precision medicine and supports the development of equitable healthcare solutions. Future research will focus on extending these methods to larger and more diverse datasets to further validate their applicability across different medical conditions and populations.},

However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.},

Currently, no dedicated public medical datasets with imaging data for fairness learning are available, though minority groups suffer from more health issues. To address this gap, we introduce Harvard Glaucoma Fairness (Harvard-GF), a retinal nerve disease dataset with both 2D and 3D imaging data and balanced racial groups for glaucoma detection. Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness globally with Blacks having doubled glaucoma prevalence than other races. We also propose a fair identity normalization (FIN) approach to equalize the feature importance between different identity groups. Our FIN approach is compared with various the-state-of-the-art fairness learning methods with superior performance in the racial, gender, and ethnicity fairness tasks with 2D and 3D imaging data, which demonstrate the utilities of our dataset Harvard-GF for fairness learning. To facilitate fairness comparisons between different models, we propose an equity-scaled performance measure, which can be flexibly used to compare all kinds of performance metrics in the context of fairness.

METHODS: An innovative pedicle screw trajectory planning system called Bone's Trajectory was developed using a 3D graphic search and an AI-based finite element analysis model. The preoperative CT scans of 21 elderly osteoporotic patients were analyzed retrospectively. The AI model automatically calculated the number of alternative transpedicular trajectories, the trajectory BMD, and the estimated POF of L3-5. The highest BMD and highest POF of optimized trajectories were recorded and compared with AO standard trajectories. RESULTS: The average patient age and average BMD of the vertebral bodies were 69.6 {\textpm} 7.8 years and 55.9 {\textpm} 17.1 mg/ml, respectively. On both sides of L3-5, the optimized trajectories showed significantly higher BMD and POF than the AO standard trajectories (p {$<$} 0.05). On average, the POF of optimized trajectory screws showed at least a 2.0-fold increase compared with AO trajectory screws.

The eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has become increasingly important to interpret the machine learning models to enhance trust management by allowing human experts to understand the underlying data evidence and causal reasoning. According to IDS, the critical role of trust management is to understand the impact of the malicious data to detect any intrusion in the system. The previous studies focused more on the accuracy of the various classification algorithms for trust in IDS. They do not often provide insights into their behavior and reasoning provided by the sophisticated algorithm. Therefore, in this paper, we have addressed XAI concept to enhance trust management by exploring the decision tree model in the area of IDS. We use simple decision tree algorithms that can be easily read and even resemble a human approach to decision-making by splitting the choice into many small subchoices for IDS. We experimented with this approach by extracting rules in a widely used KDD benchmark dataset. We also compared the accuracy of the decision tree approach with the other state-of-the-art algorithms.},

This study leverages explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) and electronic health records (EHRs) to develop interpretable machine learning models for prognostic factor identification in CRC. Using a retrospective cohort of 8,247 patients, we extracted 1,247 features from EHRs, including demographic, laboratory, treatment, and natural language processing (NLP)-derived data. After rigorous feature selection, six machine learning models were evaluated, with XGBoost achieving the highest performance (C-index: 0.798, 95\% CI: 0.785--0.811), significantly outperforming traditional Cox models (C-index: 0.742) and established prognostic scores. SHAP and LIME analyses identified both established prognostic factors (e.g., TNM stage, age) and novel predictors, such as temporal albumin trends and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), which accounted for 40\% of the top prognostic features. Clinical validation by oncology experts confirmed the relevance and biological plausibility of these findings. The study demonstrates that XAI-enhanced models can improve prognostic accuracy while providing transparent, actionable insights, bridging the gap between complex machine learning outputs and clinical decision-making. These results highlight the potential of integrating comprehensive EHR data with XAI to advance precision oncology in CRC care.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Causal feature selection is essential for estimating effects from observational data. Identifying confounders is a crucial step in this process. Traditionally, researchers employ content-matter expertise and literature review to identify confounders. Uncontrolled confounding from unidentified confounders threatens validity, conditioning on intermediate variables (mediators) weakens estimates, and conditioning on common effects (colliders) induces bias. Additionally, without special treatment, erroneous conditioning on variables combining roles introduces bias. However, the vast literature is growing exponentially, making it infeasible to assimilate this knowledge. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel knowledge graph (KG) application enabling causal feature selection by combining computable literature-derived knowledge with biomedical ontologies. We present a use case of our approach specifying a causal model for estimating the total causal effect of depression on the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) from observational data. METHODS: We extracted computable knowledge from a literature corpus using three machine reading systems and inferred missing knowledge using logical closure operations. Using a KG framework, we mapped the output to target terminologies and combined it with ontology-grounded resources. We translated epidemiological definitions of confounder, collider, and mediator into queries for searching the KG and summarized the roles played by the identified variables. We compared the results with output from a complementary method and published observational studies and examined a selection of confounding and combined role variables in-depth. RESULTS: Our search identified 128 confounders, including 58 phenotypes, 47 drugs, 35 genes, 23 collider, and 16 mediator phenotypes. However, only 31 of the 58 confounder phenotypes were found to behave exclusively as confounders, while the remaining 27 phenotypes played other roles. Obstructive sleep apnea emerged as a potential novel confounder for depression and AD. Anemia exemplified a variable playing combined roles. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest combining machine reading and KG could augment human expertise for causal feature selection. However, the complexity of causal feature selection for depression with AD highlights the need for standardized field-specific databases of causal variables. Further work is needed to optimize KG search and transform the output for human consumption.},

This has put the quest for neural-symbolic artificial intelligence (NeSy) high on the research agenda. In the past decade, neural networks have caused great advances in the field of machine learning. Conversely, the two most prominent frameworks for reasoning are logic and probability. While in the past they were studied by separate communities, a significant number of researchers has been working towards their integration, cf. the area of statistical relational artificial intelligence (StarAI). Generally, NeSy systems integrate logic with neural networks. However, probability theory has already been integrated with both logic (cf. StarAI) and neural networks. It therefore makes sense to consider the integration of logic, neural networks and probabilities. In this chapter, we first consider these three base paradigms separately. Then, we look at the well established integrations, NeSy and StarAI. Next, we consider the integration of all three paradigms as Neural Probabilistic Logic Programming, and exemplify it with the DeepProbLog framework. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the state of the art, and consider future directions based on the parallels between StarAI and NeSy.},

Our model builds an object-based scene representation and translates sentences into executable, symbolic programs. To bridge the learning of two modules, we use a neuro-symbolic reasoning module that executes these programs on the latent scene representation. Analogical to human concept learning, the perception module learns visual concepts based on the language description of the object being referred to. Meanwhile, the learned visual concepts facilitate learning new words and parsing new sentences. We use curriculum learning to guide the searching over the large compositional space of images and language. Extensive experiments demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our model on learning visual concepts, word representations, and semantic parsing of sentences. Further, our method allows easy generalization to new object attributes, compositions, language concepts, scenes and questions, and even new program domains. It also empowers applications including visual question answering and bidirectional image-text retrieval.},

To facilitate learning and reasoning, the concepts are typed and represented using a combination of symbolic programs and neural network representations. Leveraging such neuro-symbolic concepts, the agent can efficiently learn and recombine them to solve various tasks across different domains, ranging from 2D images, videos, 3D scenes, and robotic manipulation tasks.

  abstract = {The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in cardiovascular imaging has revolutionized the field, offering significant advancements in diagnostic accuracy and clinical efficiency. However, the complexity and opacity of AI models, particularly those involving machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), raise critical legal and ethical concerns due to their "black box" nature. This manuscript addresses these concerns by providing a comprehensive review of AI technologies in cardiovascular imaging, focusing on the challenges and implications of the black box phenomenon. We begin by outlining the foundational concepts of AI, including ML and DL, and their applications in cardiovascular imaging. The manuscript delves into the "black box" issue, highlighting the difficulty in understanding and explaining AI decision-making processes. This lack of transparency poses significant challenges for clinical acceptance and ethical deployment. The discussion then extends to the legal and ethical implications of AI's opacity. The need for explicable AI systems is underscored, with an emphasis on the ethical principles of beneficence and non-maleficence. The manuscript explores potential solutions such as explainable AI (XAI) techniques, which aim to provide insights into AI decision-making without sacrificing performance. Moreover, the impact of AI explainability on clinical decision-making and patient outcomes is examined. The manuscript argues for the development of hybrid models that combine interpretability with the advanced capabilities of black box systems. It also advocates for enhanced education and training programs for healthcare professionals to equip them with the necessary skills to utilize AI effectively. Patient involvement and informed consent are identified as critical components for the ethical deployment of AI in healthcare. Strategies for improving patient understanding and engagement with AI technologies are discussed, emphasizing the importance of transparent communication and education. Finally, the manuscript calls for the establishment of standardized regulatory frameworks and policies to address the unique challenges posed by AI in healthcare. By fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and continuous monitoring, the medical community can ensure the responsible integration of AI into cardiovascular imaging, ultimately enhancing patient care and clinical outcomes.},

However, challenges persist in comprehensively interpreting these models, hindering their widespread adoption. This study addresses these challenges by exploring recently emerging techniques in XAI. The primary problem addressed is the lack of transparency and interpretability in AI models to humanity for institution-wide use, which undermines user trust and inhibits their integration into critical decision-making processes. Through an in-depth review, this study identifies the objectives of enhancing the interpretability of AI models and improving human understanding of their decision-making processes. Various methodological approaches, including post-hoc explanations, model transparency methods, and interactive visualization techniques, are investigated to elucidate AI model behaviours. We further present techniques and methods to make AI models more interpretable and understandable to humans including their strengths and weaknesses to demonstrate promising advancements in model interpretability, facilitating better comprehension of complex AI systems by humans. In addition, we provide the application of XAI in local use cases. Challenges, solutions, and open research directions were highlighted to clarify these compelling XAI utilization challenges. The implications of this research are profound, as enhanced interpretability fosters trust in AI systems across diverse applications, from healthcare to finance.

However, due to the lack of transparency the use of these networks is hampered in the areas with safety critical areas. In safety-critical areas, this is necessary by law. Recently several methods have been proposed to uncover this black box by providing interpreation of predictions made by these models. The paper focuses on time series analysis and benchmark several state-of-the-art attribution methods which compute explanations for convolutional classifiers. The presented experiments involve gradient-based and perturbation-based attribution methods. A detailed analysis shows that perturbation-based approaches are superior concerning the Sensitivity and occlusion game. These methods tend to produce explanations with higher continuity. Contrarily, the gradient-based techniques are superb in runtime and Infidelity. In addition, a validation the dependence of the methods on the trained model, feasible application domains, and individual characteristics is attached. The findings accentuate that choosing the best-suited attribution method is strongly correlated with the desired use case.

Especially for image classification tasks, many state-of-the-art tools to explain such classifiers rely on visual highlighting of important areas of the input data. Contrary, counterfactual explanation systems try to enable a counterfactual reasoning by modifying the input image in a way such that the classifier would have made a different prediction. By doing so, the users of counterfactual explanation systems are equipped with a completely different kind of explanatory information. However, methods for generating realistic counterfactual explanations for image classifiers are still rare. Especially in medical contexts, where relevant information often consists of textural and structural information, high-quality counterfactual images have the potential to give meaningful insights into decision processes. In this work, we present               GANterfactual               , an approach to generate such counterfactual image explanations based on adversarial image-to-image translation techniques. Additionally, we conduct a user study to evaluate our approach in an exemplary medical use case. Our results show that, in the chosen medical use-case, counterfactual explanations lead to significantly better results regarding mental models, explanation satisfaction, trust, emotions, and self-efficacy than two state-of-the art systems that work with saliency maps, namely LIME and LRP.},

  abstract = {Despite the success of complex machine learning algorithms, mostly justified by an outstanding performance in prediction tasks, their inherent opaque nature still represents a challenge to their responsible application. Counterfactual explanations surged as one potential solution to explain individual decision results. However, two major drawbacks directly impact their usability: (1) the isonomic view of feature changes, in which it is not possible to observe {\textbackslash}textit\{how much\} each modified feature influences the prediction, and (2) the lack of graphical resources to visualize the counterfactual explanation. We introduce Counterfactual Feature (change) Importance (CFI) values as a solution: a way of assigning an importance value to each feature change in a given counterfactual explanation. To calculate these values, we propose two potential CFI methods. One is simple, fast, and has a greedy nature. The other, coined CounterShapley, provides a way to calculate Shapley values between the factual-counterfactual pair. Using these importance values, we additionally introduce three chart types to visualize the counterfactual explanations: (a) the Greedy chart, which shows a greedy sequential path for prediction score increase up to predicted class change, (b) the CounterShapley chart, depicting its respective score in a simple and one-dimensional chart, and finally (c) the Constellation chart, which shows all possible combinations of feature changes, and their impact on the model's prediction score. For each of our proposed CFI methods and visualization schemes, we show how they can provide more information on counterfactual explanations. Finally, an open-source implementation is offered, compatible with any counterfactual explanation generator algorithm. Code repository at: https://github.com/ADMAntwerp/CounterPlots},

Even though AI-powered systems have brought competitive advantages, the black-box nature makes them lack transparency and prevents them from explaining their decisions. This issue has motivated the introduction of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), which promotes AI algorithms that can show their internal process and explain how they made decisions. The number of XAI research has increased significantly in recent years, but there lacks a unified and comprehensive review of the latest XAI progress. This review aims to bridge the gap by discovering the critical perspectives of the rapidly growing body of research associated with XAI. After offering the readers a solid XAI background, we analyze and review various XAI methods, which are grouped into (i) pre-modeling explainability, (ii) interpretable model, and (iii) post-modeling explainability. We also pay attention to the current methods that dedicate to interpret and analyze deep learning methods. In addition, we systematically discuss various XAI challenges, such as the trade-off between the performance and the explainability, evaluation methods, security, and policy. Finally, we show the standard approaches that are leveraged to deal with the mentioned challenges.},

The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) provides frequently updated, complex guidelines through visuals like flowcharts and diagrams, which can be time consuming for oncologists to stay current with treatment protocols. This study presents an AI (Artificial Intelligence)-driven methodology to accurately automate treatment regimens following NCCN guidelines for breast cancer patients. We proposed two AI-driven methods: Agentic-RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and Graph-RAG. Agentic-RAG used a three-step Large Language Model (LLM) process to select clinical titles from NCCN guidelines, retrieve matching JSON content, and iteratively refine recommendations based on insufficiency checks. Graph-RAG followed a Microsoft-developed framework with proprietary prompts, where JSON data was converted to text via an LLM, summarized, and mapped into graph structures representing key treatment relationships. Final recommendations were generated by querying relevant graph summaries. Both were evaluated using a set of patient descriptions, each with four associated questions. As shown in Table 1, Agentic RAG achieved a 100\% adherence (24/24) with no hallucinations or incorrect treatments. Graph-RAG had 95.8\% adherence (23/24) with one incorrect treatment and no hallucinations. Chat GPT-4 showed 91.6\% adherence (22/24) with two wrong treatments and no hallucinations. Both Agentic RAG and Graph-RAG provided detailed treatment recommendations with accurate references to relevant NCCN document page numbers.},

Research in IML has boomed in recent years. As young as the field is, it has over 200 years old roots in regression modeling and rule-based machine learning, starting in the 1960s. Recently, many new IML methods have been proposed, many of them model-agnostic, but also interpretation techniques specific to deep learning and tree-based ensembles. IML methods either directly analyze model components, study sensitivity to input perturbations, or analyze local or global surrogate approximations of the ML model. The field approaches a state of readiness and stability, with many methods not only proposed in research, but also implemented in open-source software. But many important challenges remain for IML, such as dealing with dependent features, causal interpretation, and uncertainty estimation, which need to be resolved for its successful application to scientific problems. A further challenge is a missing rigorous definition of interpretability, which is accepted by the community. To address the challenges and advance the field, we urge to recall our roots of interpretable, data-driven modeling in statistics and (rule-based) ML, but also to consider other areas such as sensitivity analysis, causal inference, and the social sciences.},

Although they have shown to yield results at least as good as classical methods, they are often disregarded because of their lack of transparency and little to no explainability, which are key for their adoption in clinical settings. In this paper, we used data from the Netherlands Cancer Registry of 36,658~non-metastatic breast cancer patients to compare the performance of CPH with ML techniques (Random Survival Forests, Survival Support Vector Machines, and Extreme Gradient Boosting [XGB]) in predicting survival using the \$\$c\$\$-index. We demonstrated that in our dataset, ML-based models can perform at least as good as the classical CPH regression (\$\$c\$\$-index~\$\${\textbackslash}sim {\textbackslash},0.63\$\$), and in the case of XGB even better (\$\$c\$\$-index~\$\${\textbackslash}sim 0.73\$\$). Furthermore, we used Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) values to explain the models' predictions. We concluded that the difference in performance can be attributed to XGB's ability to model nonlinearities and complex interactions. We also investigated the impact of specific features on the models' predictions as well as their corresponding insights. Lastly, we showed that explainable ML can generate explicit knowledge of how models make their predictions, which is crucial in increasing the trust and adoption of innovative ML techniques in oncology and healthcare overall.},

However, most of these methodologies have been overlooking the importance of providing explanations to the decision-making process of deep learning architectures. In this research study, we explore the reliability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) at identifying relevant regions for binding, specifically binding sites and motifs, and the significance of the deep representations extracted by providing explanations to the model's decisions based on the identification of the input regions that contributed the most to the prediction. We make use of an end-to-end deep learning architecture to predict binding affinity, where CNNs are exploited in their capacity to automatically identify and extract discriminating deep representations from 1D sequential and structural data. RESULTS: The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the deep representations extracted from CNNs in the prediction of drug-target interactions. CNNs were found to identify and extract features from regions relevant for the interaction, where the weight associated with these spots was in the range of those with the highest positive influence given by the CNNs in the prediction. The end-to-end deep learning model achieved the highest performance both in the prediction of the binding affinity and on the ability to correctly distinguish the interaction strength rank order when compared to baseline approaches. CONCLUSIONS: This research study validates the potential applicability of an end-to-end deep learning architecture in the context of drug discovery beyond the confined space of proteins and ligands with determined 3D structure. Furthermore, it shows the reliability of the deep representations extracted from the CNNs by providing explainability to the decision-making process.},

Moreover, in many fields of science, learning the causal structure of dynamic systems and time series data is considered an interesting task which plays an important role in scientific discoveries. Estimating the effect of an intervention and identifying the causal relations from the data can be performed via causal inference. Existing surveys on time series discuss traditional tasks such as classification and forecasting or explain the details of the approaches proposed to solve a specific task.

An intriguing class of explanations is through counterfactuals, hypothetical examples that show people how to obtain a different prediction. We posit that effective counterfactual explanations should satisfy two properties: feasibility of the counterfactual actions given user context and constraints, and diversity among the counterfactuals presented. To this end, we propose a framework for generating and evaluating a diverse set of counterfactual explanations based on determinantal point processes. To evaluate the actionability of counterfactuals, we provide metrics that enable comparison of counterfactual-based methods to other local explanation methods. We further address necessary tradeoffs and point to causal implications in optimizing for counterfactuals. Our experiments on four real-world datasets show that our framework can generate a set of counterfactuals that are diverse and well approximate local decision boundaries, outperforming prior approaches to generating diverse counterfactuals.

  abstract = {Enhancers are short genomic segments located in non-coding regions of the genome that play a critical role in regulating the expression of target genes. Despite their importance in transcriptional regulation, effective methods for classifying enhancer categories and regulatory strengths remain limited. To address this challenge, we propose a novel end-to-end deep learning architecture named DeepEnhancerPPO. The model integrates ResNet and Transformer modules to extract local, hierarchical, and long-range contextual features. Following feature fusion, we employ Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a reinforcement learning technique, to reduce the dimensionality of the fused features, retaining the most relevant features for downstream classification tasks. We evaluate the performance of DeepEnhancerPPO from multiple perspectives, including ablation analysis, independent tests, assessment of PPO's contribution to performance enhancement, and interpretability of the classification results. Each module positively contributes to the overall performance, with ResNet and PPO being the most significant contributors. Overall, DeepEnhancerPPO demonstrates superior performance on independent datasets compared to other models, outperforming the second-best model by 6.7\% in accuracy for enhancer category classification. The model consistently ranks among the top five classifiers out of 25 for enhancer strength classification without requiring re-optimization of the hyperparameters and ranks as the second-best when the hyperparameters are refined. This indicates that the DeepEnhancerPPO framework is highly robust for enhancer classification. Additionally, the incorporation of PPO enhances the interpretability of the classification results.},

In particular, it is unclear what it means to be interpretable and how to select, evaluate, or even discuss methods for producing interpretations of machine-learning models. We aim to clarify these concerns by defining interpretable machine learning and constructing a unifying framework for existing methods which highlights the underappreciated role played by human audiences. Within this framework, methods are organized into 2 classes: model based and post hoc. To provide guidance in selecting and evaluating interpretation methods, we introduce 3 desiderata: predictive accuracy, descriptive accuracy, and relevancy. Using our framework, we review existing work, grounded in real-world studies which exemplify our desiderata, and suggest directions for future work.           ,              Machine-learning models have demonstrated great success in learning complex patterns that enable them to make predictions about unobserved data. In addition to using models for prediction, the ability to interpret what a model has learned is receiving an increasing amount of attention. However, this increased focus has led to considerable confusion about the notion of interpretability. In particular, it is unclear how the wide array of proposed interpretation methods are related and what common concepts can be used to evaluate them. We aim to address these concerns by defining interpretability in the context of machine learning and introducing the predictive, descriptive, relevant (PDR) framework for discussing interpretations. The PDR framework provides 3 overarching desiderata for evaluation: predictive accuracy, descriptive accuracy, and relevancy, with relevancy judged relative to a human audience. Moreover, to help manage the deluge of interpretation methods, we introduce a categorization of existing techniques into model-based and post hoc categories, with subgroups including sparsity, modularity, and simulatability. To demonstrate how practitioners can use the PDR framework to evaluate and understand interpretations, we provide numerous real-world examples. These examples highlight the often underappreciated role played by human audiences in discussions of interpretability. Finally, based on our framework, we discuss limitations of existing methods and directions for future work. We hope that this work will provide a common vocabulary that will make it easier for both practitioners and researchers to discuss and choose from the full range of interpretation methods.},

Using machine learning tools for the early identification of students at risk of dropping out has gained a lot of interest recently. However, there has been little discussion on dropout prediction using interpretable machine learning (IML) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) tools.In this work, using the data of a large public Hungarian university, we demonstrate how IML and XAI tools can support educational stakeholders in dropout prediction. We show that complex machine learning models -- such as the CatBoost classifier -- can efficiently identify at-risk students relying solely on pre-enrollment achievement measures, however, they lack interpretability. Applying IML tools, such as permutation importance (PI), partial dependence plot (PDP), LIME, and SHAP values, we demonstrate how the predictions can be explained both globally and locally. Explaining individual predictions opens up great opportunities for personalized intervention, for example by offering the right remedial courses or tutoring sessions. Finally, we present the results of a user study that evaluates whether higher education stakeholders find these tools interpretable and useful.},

In this communication, we first discuss the goals of precision medicine, and contextualize the use of AI in precision medicine by showcasing innovative applications (e.g., prediction of tumor growth and overall survival, biomarker identification using biomedical images, and identification of patient population for clinical practice) which were presented during the February 2023 virtual public workshop entitled "Application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Precision Medicine," hosted by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and University of Maryland Center of Excellence in Regulatory Science and Innovation (M-CERSI). Next, we put forward challenges brought about by the multidisciplinary nature of AI, particularly highlighting the need for AI to be trustworthy. To address such challenges, we subsequently note practical approaches, viz., differential privacy, synthetic data generation, and federated learning. The proposed strategies - some of which are highlighted presentations from the workshop - are for the protection of personal information and intellectual property. In addition, methods such as the risk-based management approach and the need for an agile regulatory ecosystem are discussed. Finally, we lay out a call for action that includes sharing of data and algorithms, development of regulatory guidance documents, and pooling of expertise from a broad-spectrum of stakeholders to enhance the application of AI in precision medicine.},

  abstract = {Precision medicine is the new age medicine and refers to tailoring treatments to a subpopulation who have a common susceptibility to a particular disease or similar response to a particular drug. Although the concept existed even during the times of Sir William Osler, it was given a shot in the arm with the Precision Medicine Initiative launched by Barack Obama in 2015. The main tools of precision medicine are Big data, artificial intelligence, the various omics, pharmaco-omics, environmental and social factors~and the integration of these with preventive and population medicine. Big data can be acquired from electronic health records of patients and includes various biomarkers (clinical and omics based), laboratory and radiological investigations and these can be analysed through machine learning by various complex flowcharts setting up an algorithm for the management of specific subpopulations. So, there is a move away from the traditional "one size fits all" treatment to precision-based medicine. Research in "omics" has increased in leaps and bounds and advancements have included the fields of genomics, epigenomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics~and microbiomics. Pharmaco-omics has also come to the forefront with development of new drugs and suiting a particular drug to a particular subpopulation, thus avoiding their prescription to non-responders, preventing unwanted adverse effects and proving economical in the long run. Environmental, social~and behavioural factors are as important or in fact more important than genetic factors in most complex diseases~and managing these factors form~an important part of precision medicine. Finally integrating precision with preventive and public health makes "precision medicine" a complete final product which will change the way medicine will be practised in future.},

We then applied nine feature attribution methods on a sample of the dataset and computed the spectral and temporal contributions to the final individual predictions. The aggregated results were evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively. Results suggest that LIME and Shapley sampling value methods performed best on the quantitative scores, followed by GradientShap. Most backpropagation-based techniques had highly inconsistent scores across the explained data points.

Usually detected at the advanced stages of disease, metastatic cancer accounts for 90\% of cancer-associated deaths. Therefore, the early detection of cancer, combined with current therapies, would have a significant impact on survival and treatment of various cancer types. Epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation are some of the early events underlying carcinogenesis. Here, we report on an interpretable machine learning model that can classify 13 cancer types as well as non-cancer tissue samples using only DNA methylome data, with 98.2\% accuracy. We utilize the features identified by this model to develop EMethylNET, a robust model consisting of an XGBoost model that provides information to a deep neural network that can generalize to independent data sets. We also demonstrate that the methylation-associated genomic loci detected by the classifier are associated with genes, pathways and networks involved in cancer, providing insights into the epigenomic regulation of carcinogenesis.},

We aim to show how clinical prediction models used under a counterfactual framework may help to infer individualized treatment effects. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: As an illustrative example, we reanalyze the International Stroke Trial. This large, multicenter trial enrolled 19,435 adult patients with suspected acute ischemic stroke from 36 countries, and reported a modest average benefit of aspirin (vs. no aspirin) on a composite outcome of death or dependency at 6~months. We derive and validate multivariable logistic regression models that predict the patient counterfactual risks of outcome with and without aspirin, conditionally on 23 predictors. RESULTS: The counterfactual prediction models display good performance in terms of calibration and discrimination (validation c-statistics: 0.798 and 0.794). Comparing the counterfactual predicted risks on an absolute difference scale, we show that aspirin-despite an average benefit-may increase the risk of death or dependency at 6~months (compared with the control) in a quarter of stroke patients. CONCLUSIONS: Counterfactual prediction models could help researchers and clinicians (i) infer individualized treatment effects and (ii) better target patients who may benefit from treatments.},

In this review, we discuss how these graphs are constructed and applied with a particular focus on how machine learning approaches are changing these processes. Biomedical knowledge graphs have often been constructed by integrating databases that were populated by experts via manual curation, but we are now seeing a more robust use of automated systems. A number of techniques are used to represent knowledge graphs, but often machine learning methods are used to construct a low-dimensional representation that can support many different applications. This representation is designed to preserve a knowledge graph's local and/or global structure. Additional machine learning methods can be applied to this representation to make predictions within genomic, pharmaceutical, and clinical domains. We frame our discussion first around knowledge graph construction and then around unifying representational learning techniques and unifying applications. Advances in machine learning for biomedicine are creating new opportunities across many domains, and we note potential avenues for future work with knowledge graphs that appear particularly promising.},

  abstract = {Flexible estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects lies at the heart of many statistical challenges, such as personalized medicine and optimal resource allocation. In this paper, we develop a general class of two-step algorithms for heterogeneous treatment effect estimation in observational studies. We first estimate marginal effects and treatment propensities in order to form an objective function that isolates the causal component of the signal. Then, we optimize this data-adaptive objective function. Our approach has several advantages over existing methods. From a practical perspective, our method is flexible and easy to use: In both steps, we can use any loss-minimization method, e.g., penalized regression, deep neural networks, or boosting; moreover, these methods can be fine-tuned by cross validation. Meanwhile, in the case of penalized kernel regression, we show that our method has a quasi-oracle property: Even if the pilot estimates for marginal effects and treatment propensities are not particularly accurate, we achieve the same error bounds as an oracle who has a priori knowledge of these two nuisance components. We implement variants of our approach based on penalized regression, kernel ridge regression, and boosting in a variety of simulation setups, and find promising performance relative to existing baselines.},

Following the PRISMA protocol, we analyzed 89 publications from January 2000 to June 2024, spanning 19 medical domains, with a focus on Neurology and Cancer as the most studied areas. Various data types are reviewed, including tabular data, medical imaging, and clinical text, offering a comprehensive perspective on XAI applications. Key findings identify significant gaps, such as the limited availability of public datasets, suboptimal data preprocessing techniques, insufficient feature selection and engineering, and the limited utilization of multiple XAI methods. Additionally, the lack of standardized XAI evaluation metrics and practical obstacles in integrating XAI systems into clinical workflows are emphasized. We provide actionable recommendations, including the design of explainability-centric models, the application of diverse and multiple XAI methods, and the fostering of interdisciplinary collaboration. These strategies aim to guide researchers in building robust AI models, assist technology developers in creating intuitive and user-friendly AI tools, and inform policymakers in establishing effective regulations. Addressing these gaps will promote the development of transparent, reliable, and user-centred AI systems in healthcare, ultimately improving decision-making and patient outcomes.},

As a result of the highly nonlinear structure of deep learning algorithms, these networks are hard to interpret; thus, it is not clear how the models reach their conclusions and therefore, they are often considered black-box models. The poor transparency of these models is a major drawback despite their effectiveness. In addition, recent regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), require that, in many cases, an explanation will be provided whenever the learning model may affect a person's life. For example, in autonomous vehicle applications, methods for visualizing, explaining, and interpreting deep learning models that analyze driver behavior and the road environment have become standard. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) or interpretable machine learning (IML) programs aim to enable a suite of methods and techniques that produce more explainable models while maintaining a high level of output accuracy [1--4]. These programs enable human users to better understand, trust, and manage the emerging generation of artificially intelligent systems [4].},

Aiming to improve early detection rates and diagnostic reliability, we propose an approach integrating Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, specifically focusing on the Residual Network (ResNet) architecture and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM). Utilizing a dataset of 1,000 CT scans, categorized into normal, non-cancerous, and three types of lung cancer images, we adapted the ResNet50 model through transfer learning and fine-tuning for enhanced specificity in lung cancer subtype detection. Our methodology demonstrated the modified ResNet50 model's effectiveness, significantly outperforming the original architecture in accuracy (91.11\%), precision (91.66\%), sensitivity (91.11\%), specificity (96.63\%), and F1-score (91.10\%). The inclusion of Grad-CAM provided insightful visual explanations for the model's predictions, fostering transparency and trust in computer-assisted diagnostics. The study highlights the potential of combining DCNN with XAI to advance lung cancer detection, suggesting future research should expand dataset diversity and explore multimodal data integration for broader applicability and improved diagnostic capabilities.},

The program aims to make the research results accessible to participants, and it is developing new approaches to generate, access, and make data broadly available to approved researchers. All of Us opened for enrollment in May 2018 and currently enrolls participants 18 years of age or older from a network of more than 340 recruitment sites. Elements of the program protocol include health questionnaires, electronic health records (EHRs), physical measurements, the use of digital health technology, and the collection and analysis of biospecimens. As of July 2019, more than 175,000 participants had contributed biospecimens. More than 80\% of these participants are from groups that have been historically underrepresented in biomedical research. EHR data on more than 112,000 participants from 34 sites have been collected. The All of Us data repository should permit researchers to take into account individual differences in lifestyle, socioeconomic factors, environment, and biologic characteristics in order to advance precision diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.

Neural sequence models -- which have been increasingly successful at performing complex, structured tasks -- exhibit the advantages and failure modes of System 1: they are fast and learn patterns from data, but are often inconsistent and incoherent. In this work, we seek a lightweight, training-free means of improving existing System 1-like sequence models by adding System 2-inspired logical reasoning. We explore several variations on this theme in which candidate generations from a neural sequence model are examined for logical consistency by a symbolic reasoning module, which can either accept or reject the generations. Our approach uses neural inference to mediate between the neural System 1 and the logical System 2. Results in robust story generation and grounded instruction-following show that this approach can increase the coherence and accuracy of neurally-based generations.},

  abstract = {Concept bottleneck models (CBM) are a popular way of creating more interpretable neural networks by having hidden layer neurons correspond to human-understandable concepts. However, existing CBMs and their variants have two crucial limitations: first, they need to collect labeled data for each of the predefined concepts, which is time consuming and labor intensive; second, the accuracy of a CBM is often significantly lower than that of a standard neural network, especially on more complex datasets. This poor performance creates a barrier for adopting CBMs in practical real world applications. Motivated by these challenges, we propose Label-free CBM which is a novel framework to transform any neural network into an interpretable CBM without labeled concept data, while retaining a high accuracy. Our Label-free CBM has many advantages, it is: scalable - we present the first CBM scaled to ImageNet, efficient - creating a CBM takes only a few hours even for very large datasets, and automated - training it for a new dataset requires minimal human effort. Our code is available at https://github.com/Trustworthy-ML-Lab/Label-free-CBM. Finally, in Appendix B we conduct a large scale user evaluation of the interpretability of our method.},

  abstract = {State-of-the-art machine learning models often learn spurious correlations embedded in the training data. This poses risks when deploying these models for high-stake decision-making, such as in medical applications like skin cancer detection. To tackle this problem, we propose Reveal to Revise (R2R), a framework entailing the entire eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) life cycle, enabling practitioners to iteratively identify, mitigate, and (re-)evaluate spurious model behavior with a minimal amount of human interaction. In the first step (1), R2R reveals model weaknesses by finding outliers in attributions or through inspection of latent concepts learned by the model. Secondly (2), the responsible artifacts are detected and spatially localized in the input data, which is then leveraged to (3) revise the model behavior. Concretely, we apply the methods of RRR, CDEP and ClArC for model correction, and (4) (re-)evaluate the model's performance and remaining sensitivity towards the artifact. Using two medical benchmark datasets for Melanoma detection and bone age estimation, we apply our R2R framework to VGG, ResNet and EfficientNet architectures and thereby reveal and correct real dataset-intrinsic artifacts, as well as synthetic variants in a controlled setting. Completing the XAI life cycle, we demonstrate multiple R2R iterations to mitigate different biases. Code is available on https://github.com/maxdreyer/Reveal2Revise.},

Digital health interventions that include artificial intelligence (AI) are being identified as some of the potential solutions to these challenges. The ultimate aim of these AI systems is to improve the patient's health outcomes and satisfaction, the overall population's health, and the well-being of healthcare professionals. The applications of AI in healthcare services are vast and are expected to assist, automate, and augment several healthcare services. Like any other emerging innovation, AI in healthcare also comes with its own risks and requires regulatory controls. A review of the literature was undertaken to study the existing regulatory landscape for AI in the healthcare services sector in developed nations. In the global regulatory landscape, most of the regulations for AI revolve around Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) and are regulated under digital health products. However, it is necessary to note that the current regulations may not suffice as AI-based technologies are capable of working autonomously, adapting their algorithms, and improving their performance over time based on the new real-world data that they have encountered. Hence, a global regulatory convergence for AI in healthcare, similar to the voluntary AI code of conduct that is being developed by the US-EU Trade and Technology Council, would be beneficial to all nations, be it developing or developed.},

Most LLMs generate the final result based solely on a single query and LLM's reasoning capabilities. However, with the advent of OpenAI-o1, 'slow thinking' techniques have garnered increasing attention because its process is closer to the human thought process. Inspired by the human ability to constantly associate and replenish knowledge during thinking, we developed the novel Chain-of-Associated-Thoughts (CoAT) framework, which introduces an innovative synergy between the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm and a dynamic mechanism for integrating new key information, termed 'associative memory'. By combining the structured exploration capabilities of MCTS with the adaptive learning capacity of associative memory, CoAT significantly expands the LLM search space, enabling our framework to explore diverse reasoning pathways and dynamically update its knowledge base in real-time. This allows the framework to not only revisit and refine earlier inferences but also adaptively incorporate evolving information, ensuring that the final output is both accurate and comprehensive. To validate the effectiveness of our framework, we conducted extensive experiments across a range of generative and reasoning tasks. These experiments demonstrated that our framework outperforms conventional inference processes on accuracy, coherence, and diversity. The framework's ability to iteratively expand its search space while retaining contextually relevant information results.},

This limitation hampers the fairness, accountability and transparency of these models; the field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) tries to solve this problem providing human-understandable explanations for black-box models. However, healthcare datasets (and the related learning tasks) often present peculiar features, such as sequential data, multi-label predictions, and links to structured background knowledge.

  abstract = {Transcription factors (TFs) regulate the gene expression of their target genes by binding to the regulatory sequences of target genes (e.g., promoters and enhancers). To fully understand gene regulatory mechanisms, it is crucial to decipher the relationships between TFs and DNA sequences. Moreover, studies such as GWAS and eQTL have verified that most disease-related variants exist in non-coding regions, and highlighted the necessity to identify such variants that cause diseases by interrupting TF binding mechanisms. To do this, it is necessary to build a prediction model that precisely predicts the binding relationships between TFs and DNA sequences. Recently, deep learning based models have been proposed and have shown competitive results on a transcription factor binding site prediction task. However, it is difficult to interpret the prediction results obtained from the previous models. In addition, the previous models assumed all the sequence regions in the input DNA sequence have the same importance for predicting TF-binding, although sequence regions containing TF-binding-associated signals such as TF-binding motifs should be captured more than other regions. To address these challenges, we propose TBiNet, an attention based interpretable deep neural network for predicting transcription factor binding sites. Using the attention mechanism, our method is able to assign more importance on the actual TF binding sites in the input DNA sequence. TBiNet outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods (DeepSea and DanQ) quantitatively in the TF-DNA binding prediction task. Moreover, TBiNet is more effective than the previous models in discovering known TF-binding motifs.},

We reported the research trend and most-studied diseases. We grouped XAI methods into 5 categories: knowledge distillation and rule extraction (N\,=\,13), intrinsically interpretable models (N\,=\,9), data dimensionality reduction (N\,=\,8), attention mechanism (N\,=\,7), and feature interaction and importance (N\,=\,5).XAI evaluation is an open issue that requires~a deeper focus in the case of medical applications. We also discuss the importance of reproducibility of research work in this field, as well as the challenges and opportunities of XAI from 2 medical professionals' point of view.Based on our review, we found that XAI evaluation in medicine has not been adequately and formally practiced.

  abstract = {Rationale and Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of an artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology literacy course on participants from nine radiology residency programs in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic United States. Materials and Methods A week-long AI in radiology course was developed and included participants from nine radiology residency programs in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic United States. Ten 30 minutes lectures utilizing a remote learning format covered basic AI terms and methods, clinical applications of AI in radiology by four different subspecialties, and special topics lectures on the economics of AI, ethics of AI, algorithm bias, and medicolegal implications of AI in medicine. A proctored hands-on clinical AI session allowed participants to directly use an FDA cleared AI-assisted viewer and reporting system for advanced cancer. Pre- and post-course electronic surveys were distributed to assess participants' knowledge of AI terminology and applications and interest in AI education. Results There were an average of 75 participants each day of the course (range: 50--120). Nearly all participants reported a lack of sufficient exposure to AI in their radiology training (96.7\%, 90/93). Mean participant score on the pre-course AI knowledge evaluation was 8.3/15, with a statistically significant increase to 10.1/15 on the post-course evaluation (p= 0.04). A majority of participants reported an interest in continued AI in radiology education in the future (78.6\%, 22/28). Conclusion A multi-institutional AI in radiology literacy course successfully improved AI education of participants, with the majority of participants reporting a continued interest in AI in radiology education in the future.},

  abstract = {Recent artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have achieved radiologist-level performance on various medical classification tasks. However, only a few studies addressed the localization of abnormal findings from CXR scans, which is essential in explaining the image-level classification to radiologists. We introduce in this paper an explainable deep learning system called VinDr-CXR that can classify a CXR scan into multiple thoracic diseases and, at the same time, localize most types of critical findings on the image. VinDr-CXR was trained on 51,485 CXR scans with radiologist-provided bounding box annotations. It demonstrated a comparable performance to experienced radiologists in classifying 6 common thoracic diseases on a retrospective validation set of 3,000 CXR scans, with a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.967 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.958-0.975). The VinDr-CXR was also externally validated in independent patient cohorts and showed its robustness. For the localization task with 14 types of lesions, our free-response receiver operating characteristic (FROC) analysis showed that the VinDr-CXR achieved a sensitivity of 80.2\% at the rate of 1.0 false-positive lesion identified per scan. A prospective study was also conducted to measure the clinical impact of the VinDr-CXR in assisting six experienced radiologists. The results indicated that the proposed system, when used as a diagnosis supporting tool, significantly improved the agreement between radiologists themselves with an increase of 1.5\% in mean Fleiss' Kappa. We also observed that, after the radiologists consulted VinDr-CXR's suggestions, the agreement between each of them and the system was remarkably increased by 3.3\% in mean Cohen's Kappa.},

Too often, the litany of proposed explainable deep learning methods stop at the first step, providing practitioners with insight into a model, but no way to act on it. In this paper, we propose contextual decomposition explanation penalization (CDEP), a method which enables practitioners to leverage existing explanation methods to increase the predictive accuracy of a deep learning model. In particular, when shown that a model has incorrectly assigned importance to some features, CDEP enables practitioners to correct these errors by inserting domain knowledge into the model via explanations. We demonstrate the ability of CDEP to increase performance on an array of toy and real datasets.},

One remaining challenge is the interpretability of latent variables as biological processes that define a cell's identity. Outside of biological applications, this problem is commonly referred to as learning disentangled representations. Although several disentanglement-promoting variants of the VAE were introduced, and applied to single-cell genomics data, this task has been shown to be infeasible from independent and identically distributed measurements, without additional structure. Instead, recent methods propose to leverage non-stationary data, as well as the sparse mechanism shift assumption in order to learn disentangled representations with a causal semantic. Here, we extend the application of these methodological advances to the analysis of single-cell genomics data with genetic or chemical perturbations. More precisely, we propose a deep generative model of single-cell gene expression data for which each perturbation is treated as a stochastic intervention targeting an unknown, but sparse, subset of latent variables. We benchmark these methods on simulated single-cell data to evaluate their performance at latent units recovery, causal target identification and out-of-domain generalization. Finally, we apply those approaches to two real-world large-scale gene perturbation data sets and find that models that exploit the sparse mechanism shift hypothesis surpass contemporary methods on a transfer learning task. We implement our new model and benchmarks using the scvi-tools library, and release it as open-source software at {$<$}a href="https://github.com/Genentech/sVAE"{$>$}https://github.com/Genentech/sVAE{$<$}/a{$>$}.},

We use the axioms to guide the design of a new attribution method called Integrated Gradients. Our method requires no modification to the original network and is extremely simple to implement; it just needs a few calls to the standard gradient operator. We apply this method to a couple of image models, a couple of text models and a chemistry model, demonstrating its ability to debug networks, to extract rules from a network, and to enable users to engage with models better.},

To address these challenges, we introduce Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs), which provide an interpretation of a neural net's internal state in terms of human-friendly concepts. The key idea is to view the high-dimensional internal state of a neural net as an aid, not an obstacle. We show how to use CAVs as part of a technique, Testing with CAVs (TCAV), that uses directional derivatives to quantify the degree to which a user-defined concept is important to a classification result--for example, how sensitive a prediction of ``zebra'' is to the presence of stripes. Using the domain of image classification as a testing ground, we describe how CAVs may be used to explore hypotheses and generate insights for a standard image classification network as well as a medical application.},

However, they often violate syntactic and semantic rules of their output language, limiting their practical usability. In this paper, we propose Synchromesh: a framework for substantially improving the reliability of pre-trained models for code generation. Synchromesh comprises two components. First, it retrieves few-shot examples from a training bank using Target Similarity Tuning (TST), a novel method for semantic example selection. TST learns to recognize utterances that describe similar target programs despite differences in surface natural language features. Then, Synchromesh feeds the examples to a pre-trained language model and samples programs using Constrained Semantic Decoding (CSD): a general framework for constraining the output to a set of valid programs in the target language. CSD leverages constraints on partial outputs to sample complete correct programs, and needs neither re-training nor fine-tuning of the language model. We evaluate our methods by synthesizing code from natural language descriptions using GPT-3 and Codex in three real-world languages: SQL queries, Vega-Lite visualizations and SMCalFlow programs. These domains showcase rich constraints that CSD is able to enforce, including syntax, scope, typing rules, and contextual logic. We observe substantial complementary gains from CSD and TST in prediction accuracy and in effectively preventing run-time errors.},

Dermatological diagnosis poses two major challenges for standard off-the-shelf techniques: First, the data distribution is typically extremely long tailed. Second, intra-class variability is often large. To address the first issue, we formulate the problem as low-shot learning, where once deployed, a base classifier must rapidly generalize to diagnose novel conditions given very few labeled examples. To model diverse classes effectively, we propose Prototypical Clustering Networks (PCN), an extension to Prototypical Networks that learns a mixture of prototypes for each class. Prototypes are initialized for each class via clustering and refined via an online update scheme. Classification is performed by measuring similarity to a weighted combination of prototypes within a class, where the weights are the inferred cluster responsibilities. We demonstrate the strengths of our approach in effective diagnosis on a realistic dataset of dermatological conditions.},

  abstract = {The Comprehensive In-vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CiPA) initiative aims to refine the assessment of drug-induced torsades de pointes (TdP) risk, utilizing computational models to predict cardiac drug toxicity. Despite advancements in machine learning applications for this purpose, the specific contribution of in-silico biomarkers to toxicity risk levels has yet to be thoroughly elucidated. This study addresses this gap by implementing explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to illuminate the impact of individual biomarkers in drug toxicity prediction. We employed the Markov chain Monte Carlo method to generate a detailed dataset for 28 drugs, from which twelve in-silico biomarkers of 12 drugs were computed to train various machine learning models, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests (RF), XGBoost, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks. Our study's innovation is leveraging XAI, mainly through the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) method, to dissect and quantify the contributions of biomarkers across these models. Furthermore, the model performance was evaluated using the test set from 16 drugs. We found that the ANN model coupled with the eleven most influential in-silico biomarkers namely    dVm dt  repol  ,  dVm dt  max  , APD 90 , APD 50 , APD tri  , CaD 90 , CaD 50 , Ca tri  , Ca Diastole  , q I n w a r d , a n d q N e t  showed the highest classification performance among all classifiers with Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores of 0.92 for predicting high-risk, 0.83 for intermediate-risk, and 0.98 for low-risk drugs. We also found that the optimal in silico biomarkers selected based on SHAP analysis may be different for various classification models. However, we also found that the biomarker selection only sometimes improved the performance; therefore, evaluating various classifiers is still essential to obtain the desired classification performance. Our proposed method could provide a systematic way to assess the best classifier with the optimal in-silico biomarkers for predicting the TdP risk of drugs, thereby advancing the field of cardiac safety evaluations.},

  abstract = {Big data, high-performance computing, and (deep) machine learning are increasingly becoming key to precision medicine---from identifying disease risks and taking preventive measures, to making diagnoses and personalizing treatment for individuals. Precision medicine, however, is not only about predicting risks and outcomes, but also about weighing interventions. Interventional clinical predictive models require the correct specification of cause and effect, and the calculation of so-called counterfactuals, that is, alternative scenarios. In biomedical research, observational studies are commonly affected by confounding and selection bias. Without robust assumptions, often requiring a priori domain knowledge, causal inference is not feasible. Data-driven prediction models are often mistakenly used to draw causal effects, but neither their parameters nor their predictions necessarily have a causal interpretation. Therefore, the premise that data-driven prediction models lead to trustable decisions/interventions for precision medicine is questionable. When pursuing intervention modelling, the bio-health informatics community needs to employ causal approaches and learn causal structures. Here we discuss how target trials (algorithmic emulation of randomized studies), transportability (the licence to transfer causal effects from one population to another) and prediction invariance (where a true causal model is contained in the set of all prediction models whose accuracy does not vary across different settings) are linchpins to developing and testing intervention models.},

Although age predictors called epigenetic clocks can accurately estimate the biological age of an individual based on cellular DNA methylation, their models have limited ability to explain the prediction algorithm behind and underlying key biological processes controlling ageing. Here we present XAI-AGE, a biologically informed, explainable deep neural network model for accurate biological age prediction across multiple tissue types.

  abstract = {Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), i.e., the development of more transparent and interpretable AI models, has gained increased traction over the last few years. This is due to the fact that, in conjunction with their growth into powerful and ubiquitous tools, AI models exhibit one detrimential characteristic: a performance-transparency trade-off. This describes the fact that the more complex a model's inner workings, the less clear it is how its predictions or decisions were achieved. But, especially considering Machine Learning (ML) methods like Reinforcement Learning (RL) where the system learns autonomously, the necessity to understand the underlying reasoning for their decisions becomes apparent. Since, to the best of our knowledge, there exists no single work offering an overview of Explainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL) methods, this survey attempts to address this gap. We give a short summary of the problem, a definition of important terms, and offer a classification and assessment of current XRL methods. We found that a) the majority of XRL methods function by mimicking and simplifying a complex model instead of designing an inherently simple one, and b) XRL (and XAI) methods often neglect to consider the human side of the equation, not taking into account research from related fields like psychology or philosophy. Thus, an interdisciplinary effort is needed to adapt the generated explanations to a (non-expert) human user in order to effectively progress in the field of XRL and XAI in general.},

This restricted form of supervision limits their generality and usability since additional labeled data is needed to specify any other visual concept. Learning directly from raw text about images is a promising alternative which leverages a much broader source of supervision. We demonstrate that the simple pre-training task of predicting which caption goes with which image is an efficient and scalable way to learn SOTA image representations from scratch on a dataset of 400 million (image, text) pairs collected from the internet. After pre-training, natural language is used to reference learned visual concepts (or describe new ones) enabling zero-shot transfer of the model to downstream tasks. We study the performance of this approach by benchmarking on over 30 different existing computer vision datasets, spanning tasks such as OCR, action recognition in videos, geo-localization, and many types of fine-grained object classification. The model transfers non-trivially to most tasks and is often competitive with a fully supervised baseline without the need for any dataset specific training. For instance, we match the accuracy of the original ResNet-50 on ImageNet zero-shot without needing to use any of the 1.28 million training examples it was trained on. We release our code and pre-trained model weights at https://github.com/OpenAI/CLIP.},

However, most of these algorithms assume accurate estimation of the data distribution, which is impractical for high-dimensional variables such as images. On the other hand, modern deep generative architectures can be trained to sample from high-dimensional distributions. However, training these networks are typically very costly. Thus, it is desirable to leverage pre-trained models to answer causal queries using such high-dimensional data. To address this, we propose modular training of deep causal generative models that not only makes learning more efficient, but also allows us to utilize large, pre-trained conditional generative models. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm, Modular-DCM is the first algorithm that, given the causal structure, uses adversarial training to learn the network weights, and can make use of pre-trained models to provably sample from any identifiable causal query in the presence of latent confounders. With extensive experiments on the Colored-MNIST dataset, we demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms the baselines. We also show our algorithm's convergence on the COVIDx dataset and its utility with a causal invariant prediction problem on CelebA-HQ.},

This systematic review examines a selection of recent publications to understand how KGs are currently being used in eXplainable AI systems. To achieve this goal, we design a framework and divide the use of KGs into four categories: extracting features, extracting relationships, constructing KGs, and KG reasoning. We also identify where KGs are mostly used in eXplainable AI systems (pre-model, in-model, and post-model) according to the aforementioned categories. Based on our analysis, KGs have been mainly used in pre-model XAI for feature and relation extraction. They were also utilised for inference and reasoning in post-model XAI. We found several studies that leveraged KGs to explain the XAI models in the healthcare domain.},

Therefore, the automated extraction of such relations from medical text, and the development of ontologies for representing them, are active fields of research. Causal relation extraction is typically decomposed into causal sentence detection, entity recognition, and relation extraction. This study addresses the entity recognition sub-task, which remains largely unsolved since existing ontological models do not capture the various entities involved in causal relations, and datasets annotated with such entities are missing. Therefore, here we propose MediCause, an ontological model for entities involved in causal relations, and a novel dataset using it to annotate 1,202 causal sentences from existing datasets. We evaluate MediCause by training various BERT models that can recognize and label the entities in unseen texts, and we find that a BioBERT-large model fine-tuned with our dataset is the best model at this task (macro-averaged F1-score of 0.844). We also use MediCause to annotate entities in causal sentences from unseen, recent publications, and have experts evaluate them with encouraging results.},

  abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an aggressive interstitial lung disease with a high mortality rate. Putative drug targets in IPF have failed to translate into effective therapies at the clinical level. We identify TRAF2- and NCK-interacting kinase (TNIK) as an anti-fibrotic target using a predictive artificial intelligence (AI) approach. Using AI-driven methodology, we generated INS018\_055, a small-molecule TNIK inhibitor, which exhibits desirable drug-like properties and anti-fibrotic activity across different organs in vivo through oral, inhaled or topical administration. INS018\_055 possesses anti-inflammatory effects in addition to its anti-fibrotic profile, validated in multiple in vivo studies. Its safety and tolerability as well as pharmacokinetics were validated in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase I clinical trial (NCT05154240) involving 78 healthy participants. A separate phase I trial in China, CTR20221542, also demonstrated comparable safety and pharmacokinetic profiles. This work was completed in roughly 18 months from target discovery to preclinical candidate nomination and demonstrates the capabilities of our generative AI-driven drug-discovery pipeline.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated potential in healthcare, particularly in enhancing diagnostic accuracy and decision-making through Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSSs). However, the successful implementation of these systems relies on user trust and reliance, which can be influenced by explainable AI. This study explores the impact of varying explainability levels on clinicians trust, cognitive load, and diagnostic performance in breast cancer detection. Utilizing an interrupted time series design, we conducted a web-based experiment involving 28 healthcare professionals. The results revealed that high confidence scores substantially increased trust but also led to overreliance, reducing diagnostic accuracy. In contrast, low confidence scores decreased trust and agreement while increasing diagnosis duration, reflecting more cautious behavior. Some explainability features influenced cognitive load by increasing stress levels. Additionally, demographic factors such as age, gender, and professional role shaped participants' perceptions and interactions with the system. This study provides valuable insights into how explainability impact clinicians' behavior and decision-making. The findings highlight the importance of designing AI-driven CDSSs that balance transparency, usability, and cognitive demands to foster trust and improve integration into clinical workflows.},

Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier should not be trusted.},

In medical diagnosis a doctor aims to explain a patient's symptoms by determining the diseases causing them. However, existing machine learning approaches to diagnosis are purely associative, identifying diseases that are strongly correlated with a patients symptoms. We show that this inability to disentangle correlation from causation can result in sub-optimal or dangerous diagnoses. To overcome this, we reformulate diagnosis as a counterfactual inference task and derive counterfactual diagnostic algorithms. We compare our counterfactual algorithms to the standard associative algorithm and 44 doctors using a test set of clinical vignettes. While the associative algorithm achieves an accuracy placing in the top 48\% of doctors in our cohort, our counterfactual algorithm places in the top 25\% of doctors, achieving expert clinical accuracy. Our results show that causal reasoning is a vital missing ingredient for applying machine learning to medical diagnosis.},

MR provides a more robust understanding of the influence of these exposures on outcomes because germline genetic variants are randomly inherited from parents to offspring and, as a result, should not be related to potential confounding factors that influence exposure-outcome associations. The genetic variant can therefore be used as a tool to link the proposed risk factor and outcome, and to estimate this effect with less confounding and bias than conventional epidemiological approaches. We describe the scope of MR, highlighting the range of applications being made possible as genetic data sets and resources become larger and more freely available. We outline the MR approach in detail, covering concepts, assumptions, and estimation methods.

  abstract = {Background               Artificial intelligence (AI) has significant potential in clinical practice. However, its ``black box'' nature can lead clinicians to question its value. The challenge is to create sufficient trust for clinicians to feel comfortable using AI, but not so much that they defer to it even when it produces results that conflict with their clinical judgment in ways that lead to incorrect decisions. Explainable AI (XAI) aims to address this by providing explanations of how AI algorithms reach their conclusions. However, it remains unclear whether such explanations foster an appropriate degree of trust to ensure the optimal use of AI in clinical practice.                                         Objective               This study aims to systematically review and synthesize empirical evidence on the impact of XAI on clinicians' trust in AI-driven clinical decision-making.                                         Methods               A systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, searching PubMed and Web of Science databases. Studies were included if they empirically measured the impact of XAI on clinicians' trust using cognition- or affect-based measures. Out of 778 articles screened, 10 met the inclusion criteria. We assessed the risk of bias using standard tools appropriate to the methodology of each paper.                                         Results               The risk of bias in all papers was moderate or moderate to high. All included studies operationalized trust primarily through cognitive-based definitions, with 2 also incorporating affect-based measures. Out of these, 5 studies reported that XAI increased clinicians' trust compared with standard AI, particularly when the explanations were clear, concise, and relevant to clinical practice. In addition, 3 studies found no significant effect of XAI on trust, and the presence of explanations does not automatically improve trust. Notably, 2 studies highlighted that XAI could either enhance or diminish trust, depending on the complexity and coherence of the provided explanations. The majority of studies suggest that XAI has the potential to enhance clinicians' trust in recommendations generated by AI. However, complex or contradictory explanations can undermine this trust. More critically, trust in AI is not inherently beneficial, as AI recommendations are not infallible. These findings underscore the nuanced role of explanation quality and suggest that trust can be modulated through the careful design of XAI systems.                                         Conclusions               Excessive trust in incorrect advice generated by AI can adversely impact clinical accuracy, just as can happen when correct advice is distrusted. Future research should focus on refining both cognitive and affect-based measures of trust and on developing strategies to achieve an appropriate balance in terms of trust, preventing both blind trust and undue skepticism. Optimizing trust in AI systems is essential for their effective integration into clinical practice.},

Despite these benefits, the lack of transparency in these AI models, often termed "black boxes," raises concerns about their reliability in clinical settings. Explainable AI (XAI) aims to mitigate these concerns by developing methods that make AI decisions understandable and trustworthy. In this study, we propose Tumor Aware Counterfactual Explanations (TACE), a framework designed to generate reliable counterfactual explanations for medical images. Unlike existing methods, TACE focuses on modifying tumor-specific features without altering the overall organ structure, ensuring the faithfulness of the counterfactuals. We achieve this by including an additional step in the generation process which allows to modify only the region of interest (ROI), thus yielding more reliable counterfactuals as the rest of the organ remains unchanged. We evaluate our method on mammography images and brain MRI. We find that our method far exceeds existing state-of-the-art techniques in quality, faithfulness, and generation speed of counterfactuals. Indeed, more faithful explanations lead to a significant improvement in classification success rates, with a 10.69\% increase for breast cancer and a 98.02\% increase for brain tumors.

From an initial pool of 664 articles identified through the Web of Science database, 512 peer-reviewed journal articles met the inclusion criteria---namely, being recent, high-quality XAI application articles published in English---and were analyzed in detail. Both qualitative and quantitative statistical techniques were used to analyze the identified articles: qualitatively by summarizing the characteristics of the included studies based on predefined codes, and quantitatively through statistical analysis of the data. These articles were categorized according to their application domains, techniques, and evaluation methods. Health-related applications were particularly prevalent, with a strong focus on cancer diagnosis, COVID-19 management, and medical imaging. Other significant areas of application included environmental and agricultural management, industrial optimization, cybersecurity, finance, transportation, and entertainment. Additionally, emerging applications in law, education, and social care highlight XAI's expanding impact. The review reveals a predominant use of local explanation methods, particularly SHAP and LIME, with SHAP being favored for its stability and mathematical guarantees. However, a critical gap in the evaluation of XAI results is identified, as most studies rely on anecdotal evidence or expert opinion rather than robust quantitative metrics. This underscores the urgent need for standardized evaluation frameworks to ensure the reliability and effectiveness of XAI applications. Future research should focus on developing comprehensive evaluation standards and improving the interpretability and stability of explanations. These advancements are essential for addressing the diverse demands of various application domains while ensuring trust and transparency in AI systems.},

  abstract = {Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) encompasses the strategies and methodologies used in constructing AI systems that enable end-users to comprehend and interpret the outputs and predictions made by AI models. The increasing deployment of opaque AI applications in high-stakes fields, particularly healthcare, has amplified the need for clarity and explainability. This stems from the potential high-impact consequences of erroneous AI predictions in such critical sectors. The effective integration of AI models in healthcare hinges on the capacity of these models to be both explainable and interpretable. Gaining the trust of healthcare professionals necessitates AI applications to be transparent about their decision-making processes and underlying logic. Our paper conducts a systematic review of the various facets and challenges of XAI within the healthcare realm. It aims to dissect a range of XAI methodologies and their applications in healthcare, categorizing them into six distinct groups: feature-oriented methods, global methods, concept models, surrogate models, local pixel-based methods, and human-centric approaches. Specifically, this study focuses on the significance of XAI in addressing healthcare-related challenges, underscoring its vital role in safety-critical scenarios. Our objective is to provide an exhaustive exploration of XAI's applications in healthcare, alongside an analysis of relevant experimental outcomes, thereby fostering a holistic understanding of XAI's role and potential in this critical domain.},

  abstract = {Objective We sought to develop an intensive care unit research database applying automated techniques to aggregate high-resolution diagnostic and therapeutic data from a large, diverse population of adult intensive care unit patients. This freely available database is intended to support epidemiologic research in critical care medicine and serve as a resource to evaluate new clinical decision support and monitoring algorithms. Design Data collection and retrospective analysis. Setting All adult intensive care units (medical intensive care unit, surgical intensive care unit, cardiac care unit, cardiac surgery recovery unit) at a tertiary care hospital. Patients Adult patients admitted to intensive care units between 2001 and 2007. Interventions None. Measurements and Main Results The Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care II (MIMIC-II) database consists of 25,328 intensive care unit stays. The investigators collected detailed information about intensive care unit patient stays, including laboratory data, therapeutic intervention profiles such as vasoactive medication drip rates and ventilator settings, nursing progress notes, discharge summaries, radiology reports, provider order entry data, International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision codes, and, for a subset of patients, high-resolution vital sign trends and waveforms. Data were automatically deidentified to comply with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act standards and integrated with relational database software to create electronic intensive care unit records for each patient stay. The data were made freely available in February 2010 through the Internet along with a detailed user's guide and an assortment of data processing tools. The overall hospital mortality rate was 11.7\%, which varied by critical care unit. The median intensive care unit length of stay was 2.2 days (interquartile range, 1.1--4.4 days). According to the primary International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision codes, the following disease categories each comprised at least 5\% of the case records: diseases of the circulatory system (39.1\%); trauma (10.2\%); diseases of the digestive system (9.7\%); pulmonary diseases (9.0\%); infectious diseases (7.0\%); and neoplasms (6.8\%). Conclusions MIMIC-II documents a diverse and very large population of intensive care unit patient stays and contains comprehensive and detailed clinical data, including physiological waveforms and minute-by-minute trends for a subset of records. It establishes a new public-access resource for critical care research, supporting a diverse range of analytic studies spanning epidemiology, clinical decision-rule development, and electronic tool development.},

However, simple models like decision trees may be preferred over decision forests in cases in which the generated predictions must be efficient or interpretable (e.g. in insurance or health-related use cases). This paper presents a novel method for transforming a decision forest into an interpretable decision tree, which aims at preserving the predictive performance of decision forests while enabling efficient classifications that can be understood by humans. This is done by creating a set of rule conjunctions that represent the original decision forest; the conjunctions are then hierarchically organized to form a new decision tree. We evaluate the proposed method on 33 UCI datasets and show that the resulting model usually approximates the ROC AUC gained by random forest while providing an interpretable decision path for each classification.},

  abstract = {Abstract          DNA methylation is a fundamental epigenetic modification that regulates gene expression and maintains genomic stability. Consequently, DNA methylation remains a key biomarker in cancer research, playing a vital role in diagnosis, prognosis, and tailored treatment strategies. Aberrant methylation patterns enable early cancer detection and therapeutic stratification; however, their complex patterns necessitates advanced analytical tools. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), including deep learning networks and graph-based models, have revolutionized cancer epigenomics by enabling rapid, high-resolution analysis of DNA methylation profiles. Moreover, these technologies are accelerating the development of Multi-Cancer Early Detection (MCED) tests, such as GRAIL's Galleri and CancerSEEK, which improve diagnostic accuracy across diverse cancer types. In this review, we explore the synergy between AI and DNA methylation profiling to advance precision oncology. We first examine the role of DNA methylation as a biomarker in cancer, followed by an overview of DNA profiling technologies. We then assess how AI-driven approaches transform clinical practice by enabling early detection and accurate classification. Despite their promise, challenges remain, including limited sensitivity for early-stage cancers, the black-box nature of many AI algorithms, and the need for validation across diverse populations to ensure equitable implementation. Future directions include integrating multi-omics data, developing explainable AI frameworks, and addressing ethical concerns, such as data privacy and algorithmic bias. By overcoming these gaps, AI-powered epigenetic diagnostics can enable earlier detection, more effective treatments, and improved patient outcomes, globally. In summary, this review synthesizes current advancements in the field and envisions a future where AI and epigenomics converge to redefine cancer diagnostics and therapy.},

Machine learning models revealed that transcription factors (TFs) generally act in an additive manner with weak grammar and that most enhancers increase expression from a promoter by a mechanism that does not appear to involve specific TF-TF interactions. The enhancers themselves can be classified into three types: classical, closed chromatin and chromatin dependent. We also show that few TFs are strongly active in a cell, with most activities being similar between cell types. Individual TFs can have multiple gene regulatory activities, including chromatin opening and enhancing, promoting and determining transcription start site (TSS) activity, consistent with the view that the TF binding motif is the key atomic unit of gene expression.},

  abstract = {Since the advent of deep learning (DL), the field has witnessed a continuous stream of innovations. However, the translation of these advancements into practical applications has not kept pace, particularly in safety-critical domains where artificial intelligence (AI) must meet stringent regulatory and ethical standards. This is underscored by the ongoing research in eXplainable AI (XAI) and privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML), which seek to address some limitations associated with these opaque and data-intensive models. Despite brisk research activity in both fields, little attention has been paid to their interaction. This work is the first to thoroughly investigate the effects of privacy-preserving techniques on explanations generated by common XAI methods for DL models. A detailed experimental analysis is conducted to quantify the impact of private training on the explanations provided by DL models, applied to six image datasets and five time series datasets across various domains. The analysis comprises three privacy techniques, nine XAI methods, and seven model architectures. The findings suggest non-negligible changes in explanations through the implementation of privacy measures. Apart from reporting individual effects of PPML on XAI, the paper gives clear recommendations for the choice of techniques in real applications. By unveiling the interdependencies of these pivotal technologies, this research marks an initial step toward resolving the challenges that hinder the deployment of AI in safety-critical settings.},

Impressive examples of this development can be found in domains such as image classification, sentiment analysis, speech understanding or strategic game playing. However, because of their nested non-linear structure, these highly successful machine learning and artificial intelligence models are usually applied in a black box manner, i.e., no information is provided about what exactly makes them arrive at their predictions. Since this lack of transparency can be a major drawback, e.g., in medical applications, the development of methods for visualizing, explaining and interpreting deep learning models has recently attracted increasing attention. This paper summarizes recent developments in this field and makes a plea for more interpretability in artificial intelligence. Furthermore, it presents two approaches to explaining predictions of deep learning models, one method which computes the sensitivity of the prediction with respect to changes in the input and one approach which meaningfully decomposes the decision in terms of the input variables. These methods are evaluated on three classification tasks.},

  abstract = {Mendelian randomization (MR) is a term that applies to the use of genetic variation to address causal questions about how modifiable exposures influence different outcomes. The principles of MR are based on Mendel's laws of inheritance and instrumental variable estimation methods, which enable the inference of causal effects in the presence of unobserved confounding. In this Primer, we outline the principles of MR, the instrumental variable conditions underlying MR estimation and some of the methods used for estimation. We go on to discuss how the assumptions underlying an MR study can be assessed and give methods of estimation that are robust to certain violations of these assumptions. We give examples of a range of studies in which MR has been applied, the limitations of current methods of analysis and the outlook for MR in the future. The difference between the assumptions required for MR analysis and other forms of non-interventional epidemiological studies means that MR can be used as part of a triangulation across multiple sources of evidence for causal inference.},

  abstract = {In the healthcare domain, a transformative shift is envisioned towards Healthcare 5.0. It expands the operational boundaries of Healthcare 4.0 and leverages patient-centric digital wellness. Healthcare 5.0 focuses on real-time patient monitoring, ambient control and wellness, and privacy compliance through assisted technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), Internet-of-Things (IoT), big data, and assisted networking channels. However, healthcare operational procedures, verifiability of prediction models, resilience, and lack of ethical and regulatory frameworks are potential hindrances to the realization of Healthcare 5.0. Recently, explainable AI (EXAI) has been a disruptive trend in AI that focuses on the explainability of traditional AI models by leveraging the decision-making of the models and prediction outputs. The explainability factor opens new opportunities to the black-box models and brings confidence in healthcare stakeholders to interpret the machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. EXAI is focused on improving clinical health practices and brings transparency to the predictive analysis, which is crucial in the healthcare domain. Recent surveys on EXAI in healthcare have not significantly focused on the data analysis and interpretation of models, which lowers its practical deployment opportunities. Owing to the gap, the proposed survey explicitly details the requirements of EXAI in Healthcare 5.0, the operational and data collection process. Based on the review method and presented research questions, systematically, the article unfolds a proposed architecture that presents an EXAI ensemble on the computerized tomography (CT) image classification and segmentation process. A solution taxonomy of EXAI in Healthcare 5.0 is proposed, and operational challenges are presented. A supported case study on electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring is presented that preserves the privacy of local models via federated learning (FL) and EXAI for metric validation. The case-study is supported through experimental validation. The analysis proves the efficacy of EXAI in health setups that envisions real-life model deployments in a wide range of clinical applications.},

As GNNs tightly entangle the input graph into the neural network structure, common explainable AI approaches are not applicable. To a large extent, GNNs have remained black-boxes for the user so far. In this paper, we show that GNNs can in fact be naturally explained using higher-order expansions, i.e. by identifying groups of edges that jointly contribute to the prediction. Practically, we find that such explanations can be extracted using a nested attribution scheme, where existing techniques such as layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) can be applied at each step. The output is a collection of walks into the input graph that are relevant for the prediction. Our novel explanation method, which we denote by GNN-LRP, is applicable to a broad range of graph neural networks and lets us extract practically relevant insights on sentiment analysis of text data, structure-property relationships in quantum chemistry, and image classification.},

The underlying neural networks as inherent black boxes lack transparency and are often accompanied by approaches to explain their output. However, formally defining explainability has been a notorious unsolved riddle. Here, we introduce a hypothesis-based framework for falsifiable explanations of machine learning models. A falsifiable explanation is a hypothesis that connects an intermediate space induced by the model with the sample from which the data originate. We instantiate this framework in a computational pathology setting using hyperspectral infrared microscopy. The intermediate space is an activation map, which is trained with an inductive bias to localize tumor. An explanation is constituted by hypothesizing that activation corresponds to tumor and associated structures, which we validate by histological staining as an independent secondary experiment.},

EMOGI was on average more accurate than other methods across different PPI networks and datasets. We used layer-wise relevance propagation to stratify genes according to whether their classification was driven by the interactome or any of the omics levels, and to identify important modules in the PPI network. We propose 165 novel cancer genes that do not necessarily harbour recurrent alterations but interact with known cancer genes, and we show that they correspond to essential genes from loss-of-function screens.

In this paper, we propose a new interpretability method that can be used to understand the predictions of any black-box model on images, by showing how the input image would be modified in order to produce different predictions. A StyleGAN is trained on medical images to provide a mapping between latent vectors and images. Our method identifies the optimal direction in the latent space to create a change in the model prediction. By shifting the latent representation of an input image along this direction, we can produce a series of new synthetic images with changed predictions. We validate our approach on histology and radiology images, and demonstrate its ability to provide meaningful explanations that are more informative than GradCAM heatmaps. Our method reveals the patterns learned by the model, which allows clinicians to build trust in the model's predictions, discover new biomarkers and eventually reveal potential biases.},

However, providing fast and accurate estimates of feature importance for high-dimensional data, and quantifying the uncertainty of such estimates remain open challenges. Here, we frame the task of providing explanations for the decisions of machine-learning models as a causal learning task, and train causal explanation (CXPlain) models that learn to estimate to what degree certain inputs cause outputs in another machine-learning model. CXPlain can, once trained, be used to explain the target model in little time, and enables the quantification of the uncertainty associated with its feature importance estimates via bootstrap ensembling. We present experiments that demonstrate that CXPlain is significantly more accurate and faster than existing model-agnostic methods for estimating feature importance. In addition, we confirm that the uncertainty estimates provided by CXPlain ensembles are strongly correlated with their ability to accurately estimate feature importance on held-out data.},

The Lucia Atrial Fibrillation Application (Lucia App) photographs the ECG to determine rhythm detection, calculates CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED scores, and then provides guideline-recommended anticoagulation. Our purpose was to determine the rate of accurate AF identification and appropriate anticoagulation recommendations in emergency department (ED) patients ultimately diagnosed with AF. METHODS: We performed a single-center, observational retrospective chart review in an urban California ED, with an annual census of 70,000 patients. A convenience sample of hospitalized patients with AF as a primary or secondary discharge diagnosis were evaluated for accurate ED AF diagnosis and ED anticoagulation rates. This was done by comparing the Lucia App against a gold standard board-certified cardiologist diagnosis and using the American College of Emergency Physicians AF anticoagulation guidelines. RESULTS: Two hundred and ninety seven patients were enrolled from January 2016 until December 2019. The median age was 79 years and 44.1\% were female. Compared to the gold standard diagnosis, the Lucia App detected AF in 98.3\% of the cases. Physicians recommended guideline-consistent anticoagulation therapy in 78.5\%~versus 98.3\% for the Lucia App. Of the patients with indications for anticoagulation and discharged from the ED, only 25.0\% were started at discharge. CONCLUSION: Use of a cloud-based ECG identification tool can allow non-cardiologists to achieve similar rates of AF identification as board-certified cardiologists and achieve higher rates of guideline-recommended anticoagulation therapy in the ED.},

Thus, this paper proposes a region-based approach that estimates feature importance in terms of appropriately segmented regions. By fusing the saliency maps generated from multi-scale segmentations, a more class-discriminative and visually pleasing map is obtained. This paper incorporates this regional multi-scale concept into a prediction difference method that is model-agnostic. An input image is segmented in several scales using the superpixel method, and exclusion of a region is simulated by sampling a normal distribution constructed via the boundary prior. The experimental results demonstrate that the regional multi-scale method produces much more class-discriminative and visually pleasing saliency maps.},

  abstract = {Attention mechanisms have recently boosted performance on a range of NLP tasks. Because attention layers explicitly weight input components' representations, it is also often assumed that attention can be used to identify information that models found important (e.g., specific contextualized word tokens). We test whether that assumption holds by manipulating attention weights in already-trained text classification models and analyzing the resulting differences in their predictions. While we observe some ways in which higher attention weights correlate with greater impact on model predictions, we also find many ways in which this does not hold, i.e., where gradient-based rankings of attention weights better predict their effects than their magnitudes. We conclude that while attention noisily predicts input components' overall importance to a model, it is by no means a fail-safe indicator.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence techniques can be used to classify a patient's physical activities and predict vital signs for remote patient monitoring. Regression analysis based on non-linear models like deep learning models has limited explainability due to its black-box nature. This can require decision-makers to make blind leaps of faith based on non-linear model results, especially in healthcare applications. In non-invasive monitoring, patient data from tracking sensors and their predisposing clinical attributes act as input features for predicting future vital signs. Explaining the contributions of various features to the overall output of the monitoring application is critical for a clinician's decision-making. In this study, an Explainable AI for Quantitative analysis (QXAI) framework is proposed with post-hoc model explainability and intrinsic explainability for regression and classification tasks in a supervised learning approach. This was achieved by utilizing the Shapley values concept and incorporating attention mechanisms in deep learning models. We adopted the artificial neural networks (ANN) and attention-based Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) models for the prediction of heart rate and classification of physical activities based on sensor data. The deep learning models achieved state-of-the-art results in both prediction and classification tasks. Global explanation and local explanation were conducted on input data to understand the feature contribution of various patient data. The proposed QXAI framework was evaluated using PPG-DaLiA data to predict heart rate and mobile health (MHEALTH) data to classify physical activities based on sensor data. Monte Carlo approximation was applied to the framework to overcome the time complexity and high computation power requirements required for Shapley value calculations.},

  abstract = {Sepsis is a condition caused by the body's overwhelming and life-threatening response to infection, which can lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and finally death. Common signs and symptoms include fever, increased heart rate, increased breathing rate, and confusion. Sepsis is difficult to predict, diagnose, and treat. Patients who develop sepsis have an increased risk of complications and death and face higher health care costs and longer hospitalization. Today, sepsis is one of the leading causes of mortality among populations in intensive care units (ICUs). In this paper, we look at the problem of early detection of sepsis by using temporal data mining. We focus on the use of knowledge-based temporal abstraction to create meaningful interval-based abstractions, and on time-interval mining to discover frequent interval-based patterns. We used 2,560 cases derived from the MIMIC-III database. We found that the distribution of the temporal patterns whose frequency is above 10\% discovered in the records of septic patients during the last 6 and 12 hours before onset of sepsis is significantly different from that distribution within a similar period, during an equivalent time window during hospitalization, in the records of non-septic patients. This discovery is encouraging for the purpose of performing an early diagnosis of sepsis using the discovered patterns as constructed features.},

Therefore, predicting all potential OCR-mediated loops is essential for deciphering the regulation mechanism of gene expression. However, existing loop prediction tools are restricted to specific anchor types. Here, we present CharID (Chromatin Accessible Region Interaction Detector), a two-step model that combines neural network and ensemble learning to predict OCR-mediated loops. In the first step, CharID-Anchor, an attention-based hybrid CNN-BiGRU network is constructed to discriminate between the anchor and nonanchor OCRs. In the second step, CharID-Loop uses gradient boosting decision tree with chromosome-split strategy to predict the interactions between anchor OCRs. The performance was assessed in three human cell lines, and CharID showed superior prediction performance compared with other algorithms. In contrast to the methods designed to predict a particular type of loops, CharID can detect varieties of chromatin loops not limited to enhancer-promoter loops or architectural protein-mediated loops. We constructed the OCR-mediated interaction network using the predicted loops and identified hub anchors, which are highlighted by their proximity to housekeeping genes. By analyzing loops containing SNPs associated with cardiovascular disease, we identified an SNP-gene loop indicating the regulation mechanism of the GFOD1. Taken together, CharID universally predicts diverse chromatin loops beyond other state-of-the-art methods, which are limited by anchor types, and experimental techniques, which are limited by sensitivities drastically decaying with the genomic distance of anchors. Finally, we hosted Peaksniffer, a user-friendly web server that provides online prediction, query and visualization of OCRs and associated loops.},

Here we present DeepLIFT (Deep Learning Important FeaTures), a method for decomposing the output prediction of a neural network on a specific input by backpropagating the contributions of all neurons in the network to every feature of the input. DeepLIFT compares the activation of each neuron to its 'reference activation' and assigns contribution scores according to the difference. By optionally giving separate consideration to positive and negative contributions, DeepLIFT can also reveal dependencies which are missed by other approaches. Scores can be computed efficiently in a single backward pass. We apply DeepLIFT to models trained on MNIST and simulated genomic data, and show significant advantages over gradient-based methods.

Chemotherapy remains the standard therapy for advanced NSCLC without mutations, but drug resistance often reduces effectiveness. Developing more effective methods to predict and monitor chemotherapy benefits early is crucial.                                         Methods               We carried out a retrospective cohort study of NSCLC patients without targeted mutations who received chemotherapy at West China Hospital from 2009 to 2013. We identified variables associated with chemotherapy outcomes and built four predictive models by machine learning. Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) interpreted the best model's predictions. The Kaplan--Meier method assessed key variables' impact on 5-year overall survival.                                         Results               The study enrolled 461 NSCLC patients. Eight variables were selected for the model: differentiation, surgery history, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), total bilirubin (TBIL), total protein (TP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The extreme gradient boosting (Xgboost) model exhibited superior discriminatory ability in predicting complete response (CR) probabilities to chemotherapy, with an AUC of 0.78. SHAP plots showed surgery history and high differentiation were related to CR benefits from chemotherapy. Absence of surgery, higher NLR, higher PLR, and higher LDH were all independent prognostic factors for poor survivals in NSCLC patients without mutations receiving chemotherapy.                                         Conclusions               By machine learning, we developed a predictive model to assess chemotherapy benefits in NSCLC patients without targeted mutations, utilizing eight readily available and non-invasive clinical indicators. Demonstrating satisfactory predictive performance and clinical practicability, this model may help clinicians identify patients' tendency to benefit from chemotherapy, potentially improving their prognosis.},

Although many different directions regarding interpretability have been explored for visual modalities, time series data has been neglected, with only a handful of methods tested due to their poor intelligibility. We approach the problem of interpretability in a novel way by proposing TSInsight, where we attach an auto-encoder to the classifier with a sparsity-inducing norm on its output and fine-tune it based on the gradients from the classifier and a reconstruction penalty. TSInsight learns to preserve features that are important for prediction by the classifier and suppresses those that are irrelevant, i.e., serves as a feature attribution method to boost the interpretability. In contrast to most other attribution frameworks, TSInsight is capable of generating both instance-based and model-based explanations. We evaluated TSInsight along with nine other commonly used attribution methods on eight different time series datasets to validate its efficacy. The evaluation results show that TSInsight naturally achieves output space contraction; therefore, it is an effective tool for the interpretability of deep time series models.},

  abstract = {Timely and accurate detection of an epidemic/pandemic is always desired to prevent its spread. For the detection of any disease, there can be more than one approach including deep learning models. However, transparency/interpretability of the reasoning process of a deep learning model related to health science is a necessity. Thus, we introduce an interpretable deep learning model: Gen-ProtoPNet. Gen-ProtoPNet is closely related to two interpretable deep learning models: ProtoPNet and NP-ProtoPNet The latter two models use prototypes of spacial dimension 1{\textbackslash}times 1 and the distance function L2 . In our model, we use a generalized version of the distance function L2 that enables us to use prototypes of any type of spacial dimensions, that is, square spacial dimensions and rectangular spacial dimensions to classify an input image. The accuracy and precision that our model receives is on par with the best performing non-interpretable deep learning models when we tested the models on the dataset of X -ray images. Our model attains the highest accuracy of 87.27\% on classification of three classes of images, that is close to the accuracy of 88.42\% attained by a non-interpretable model on the classification of the given dataset.},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities, but the bar for clinical applications is high. Attempts to assess the clinical knowledge of models typically rely on automated evaluations based on limited benchmarks. Here, to address these limitations, we present MultiMedQA, a benchmark combining six existing medical question answering datasets spanning professional medicine, research and consumer queries and~a new dataset of medical questions searched online, HealthSearchQA. We propose a human evaluation framework for model answers along multiple axes including factuality, comprehension,~reasoning, possible harm and bias. In addition, we evaluate Pathways Language Model1 (PaLM,~a 540-billion parameter LLM) and its instruction-tuned variant, Flan-PaLM2 on MultiMedQA. Using a combination of prompting strategies, Flan-PaLM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on every MultiMedQA multiple-choice dataset (MedQA3, MedMCQA4, PubMedQA5 and Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) clinical topics6), including 67.6\% accuracy on MedQA~(US Medical Licensing Exam-style questions), surpassing the prior state of the art by more than 17\%. However, human evaluation reveals key gaps. To resolve this, we introduce instruction prompt tuning, a parameter-efficient approach for aligning LLMs to new domains using a few exemplars. The resulting model, Med-PaLM, performs encouragingly, but remains inferior to clinicians. We show that comprehension, knowledge recall and reasoning improve with model scale and instruction prompt tuning, suggesting the potential utility of LLMs in medicine. Our human evaluations reveal limitations of today's models, reinforcing the importance of both evaluation frameworks and method development in creating safe, helpful LLMs for clinical applications.},

We briefly review different types of clinical decision support (CDS) and present the current state of CDS, which is already improving the care patients receive with genetic profile-based tailored recommendations regarding diagnostic and treatment plans. We also report on limitations of current systems, which are slowly beginning to integrate new genomic data into patient records but still present many challenges.

We developed a novel decision support interface that provides interpretable treatment recommendations for sepsis, a life-threatening condition in which decisional uncertainty is common, treatment practices vary widely, and poor outcomes can occur even with optimal decisions. This system formed the basis of a mixed-methods study in which 24 intensive care clinicians made AI-assisted decisions on real patient cases. We found that explanations generally increased confidence in the AI, but concordance with specific recommendations varied beyond the binary acceptance or rejection described in prior work. Although clinicians sometimes ignored or trusted the AI, they also often prioritized aspects of the recommendations to follow, reject, or delay in a process we term "negotiation." These results reveal novel barriers to adoption of treatment-focused AI tools and suggest ways to better support differing clinician perspectives.},

With oncologist input, we designed an interface that presents patient-specific, machine learning--based 6-month survival prognosis information designed to aid oncology providers in preparing for and discussing prognosis with patients with advanced solid tumors and their caregivers. The primary purpose of this study was to assess patient and caregiver perceptions and identify enhancements of the interface for communicating 6-month survival and other prognosis information when making treatment decisions concerning anticancer and supportive therapy.MethodsThis qualitative study included interviews and focus groups conducted between November and December 2022. Purposive sampling was used to recruit former patients with cancer and/or former caregivers of patients with cancer who had participated in cancer treatment decisions from Utah or elsewhere in the United States. Categories and themes related to perceptions of the interface were identified.ResultsWe received feedback from 20 participants during eight individual interviews and two focus groups, including four cancer survivors, 13 caregivers, and three representing both. Overall, most participants expressed positive perceptions about the tool and identified its value for supporting decision making, feeling less alone, and supporting communication among oncologists, patients, and their caregivers. Participants identified areas for improvement and implementation considerations, particularly that oncologists should share the tool and guide discussions about prognosis with patients who want to receive the information.ConclusionThis study revealed important patient and caregiver perceptions of and enhancements for the proposed interface. Originally designed with input from oncology providers, patient and caregiver participants identified additional interface design recommendations and implementation considerations to support communication about prognosis.},

Compared to recent approaches for few-shot learning, they reflect a simpler inductive bias that is beneficial in this limited-data regime, and achieve excellent results. We provide an analysis showing that some simple design decisions can yield substantial improvements over recent approaches involving complicated architectural choices and meta-learning.

The High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (AI-HLEG), set up to support the implementation of this vision, has produced guidelines discussing the types of explanations that are appropriate for user-centred (interactive) Explanatory Tools. In this paper we propose our version of Explanatory Narratives (EN), based on user-centred concepts drawn from ISO 9241, as a model for user-centred explanations aligned with the GDPR and the AI-HLEG guidelines. Through the use of ENs we convert the problem of generating explanations for ADM into the identification of an appropriate path over an Explanatory Space, allowing explainees to interactively explore it and produce the explanation best suited to their needs. To this end we list suitable exploration heuristics, we study the properties and structure of explanations, and discuss the proposed model identifying its weaknesses and strengths.},

What assumptions and methods allow us to turn observations into causal knowledge, and how can even incomplete causal knowledge be used in planning and prediction to influence and control our environment? In this book Peter Spirtes, Clark Glymour, and Richard Scheines address these questions using the formalism of Bayes networks, with results that have been applied in diverse areas of research in the social, behavioral, and physical sciences.             The authors show that although experimental and observational study designs may not always permit the same inferences, they are subject to uniform principles. They axiomatize the connection between causal structure and probabilistic independence, explore several varieties of causal indistinguishability, formulate a theory of manipulation, and develop asymptotically reliable procedures for searching over equivalence classes of causal models, including models of categorical data and structural equation models with and without latent variables.             The authors show that the relationship between causality and probability can also help to clarify such diverse topics in statistics as the comparative power of experimentation versus observation, Simpson's paradox, errors in regression models, retrospective versus prospective sampling, and variable selection.

Higher interpretability of the model means easier comprehension and explanation of future predictions for end-users. Further, interpretable machine learning models allow healthcare experts to make reasonable and data-driven decisions to provide personalized decisions that can ultimately lead to higher quality of service in healthcare. Generally, we can classify interpretability approaches in two groups where the first focuses on personalized interpretation (local interpretability) while the second summarizes prediction models on a population level (global interpretability). Alternatively, we can group interpretability methods into model-specific techniques, which are designed to interpret predictions generated by a specific model, such as a neural network, and model-agnostic approaches, which provide easy-to-understand explanations of predictions made by any machine learning model. Here, we give an overview of interpretability approaches and provide examples of practical interpretability of machine learning in different areas of healthcare, including prediction of health-related outcomes, optimizing treatments or improving the efficiency of screening for specific conditions. Further, we outline future directions for interpretable machine learning and highlight the importance of developing algorithmic solutions that can enable machine-learning driven decision making in high-stakes healthcare problems.},

  abstract = {Much of the complexity within cells arises from functional and regulatory interactions among proteins. The core of these interactions is increasingly known, but novel interactions continue to be discovered, and the information remains scattered across different database resources, experimental modalities and levels of mechanistic detail. The STRING database (https://string-db.org/) systematically collects and integrates protein--protein interactions---both physical interactions as well as functional associations. The data originate from a number of sources: automated text mining of the scientific literature, computational interaction predictions from co-expression, conserved genomic context, databases of interaction experiments and known complexes/pathways from curated sources. All of these interactions are critically assessed, scored, and subsequently automatically transferred to less well-studied organisms using hierarchical orthology information. The data can be accessed via the website, but also programmatically and via bulk downloads. The most recent developments in STRING (version 12.0) are: (i) it is now possible to create, browse and analyze a full interaction network for any novel genome of interest, by submitting its complement of encoded proteins, (ii) the co-expression channel now uses variational auto-encoders to predict interactions, and it covers two new sources, single-cell RNA-seq and experimental proteomics data and (iii) the confidence in each experimentally derived interaction is now estimated based on the detection method used, and communicated to the user in the web-interface. Furthermore, STRING continues to enhance its facilities for functional enrichment analysis, which are now fully available also for user-submitted genomes.},

This article identifies a more pervasive source of bias that affects the clinical utility of ML-enabled prediction tools: target specification bias. Target specification bias arises when the operationalization of the target variable does not match its definition by decision makers. The mismatch is often subtle, and stems from the fact that decision makers are typically interested in predicting the outcomes of counterfactual, rather than actual, healthcare scenarios. Target specification bias persists independently of data limitations and health disparities. When left uncorrected, it gives rise to an overestimation of predictive accuracy, to inefficient utilization of medical resources, and to suboptimal decisions that can harm patients. Recent work in metrology - the science of measurement - suggests ways of counteracting target specification bias and avoiding its harmful consequences.},

Although accuracy and efficiency are common goals in many modeling tasks, model interpretability is especially important to these studies towards understanding the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently gained popularity in various types of genomic and epigenomic studies due to their capabilities in utilizing large-scale high-throughput bioinformatics data and achieving high accuracy in predictions and classifications. However, DNNs are often challenged by their potential to explain the predictions due to their black-box nature. In this review, we present current development in the model interpretation of DNNs, focusing on their applications in genomics and epigenomics. We first describe state-of-the-art DNN interpretation methods in representative machine learning fields. We then summarize the DNN interpretation methods in recent studies on genomics and epigenomics, focusing on current data- and computing-intensive topics such as sequence motif identification, genetic variations, gene expression, chromatin interactions and non-coding RNAs. We also present the biological discoveries that resulted from these interpretation methods. We finally discuss the advantages and limitations of current interpretation approaches in the context of genomic and epigenomic studies. Contact:xiaoman@mail.ucf.edu, haihu@cs.ucf.edu},

In this work, we provide evidence supporting the presence of LLMs' internal compass that dictate the correctness of factual recall at the time of generation. We demonstrate that for a given subject entity and a relation, LLMs internally encode linear features in the Transformer's residual stream that dictate whether it will be able to recall the correct attribute (that forms a valid entity-relation-attribute triplet). This self-awareness signal is robust to minor formatting variations. We investigate the effects of context perturbation via different example selection strategies. Scaling experiments across model sizes and training dynamics highlight that self-awareness emerges rapidly during training and peaks in intermediate layers. These findings uncover intrinsic self-monitoring capabilities within LLMs, contributing to their interpretability and reliability.},

  abstract = {Morphological attributes from histopathological images and molecular profiles from genomic data are important information to drive diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy of cancers. By integrating these heterogeneous but complementary data, many multi-modal methods are proposed to study the complex mechanisms of cancers, and most of them achieve comparable or better results from previous single-modal methods. However, these multi-modal methods are restricted to a single task (e.g., survival analysis or grade classification), and thus neglect the correlation between different tasks. In this study, we present a multi-modal fusion framework based on multi-task correlation learning (MultiCoFusion) for survival analysis and cancer grade classification, which combines the power of multiple modalities and multiple tasks. Specifically, a pre-trained ResNet-152 and a sparse graph convolutional network (SGCN) are used to learn the representations of histopathological images and mRNA expression data respectively. Then these representations are fused by a fully connected neural network (FCNN), which is also a multi-task shared network. Finally, the results of survival analysis and cancer grade classification output simultaneously. The framework is trained by an alternate scheme. We systematically evaluate our framework using glioma datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Results demonstrate that MultiCoFusion learns better representations than traditional feature extraction methods. With the help of multi-task alternating learning, even simple multi-modal concatenation can achieve better performance than other deep learning and traditional methods. Multi-task learning can improve the performance of multiple tasks not just one of them, and it is effective in both single-modal and multi-modal data.},

We consider an alternative objective - learning set-valued policies to capture near-equivalent actions that lead to similar cumulative rewards. We propose a model-free algorithm based on temporal difference learning and a near-greedy heuristic for action selection. We analyze the theoretical properties of the proposed algorithm, providing optimality guarantees and demonstrate our approach on simulated environments and a real clinical task. Empirically, the proposed algorithm exhibits good convergence properties and discovers meaning-ful near-equivalent actions. Our work provides theoretical, as well as practical, foundations for clinician/human-in-the-loop decision making, in which humans (e.g., clinicians, patients) can in-corporate additional knowledge (e.g., side effects, patient preference) when selecting among near-equivalent actions.},

SpaHDmap incorporates non-negative matrix factorization into a multimodal fusion encoder-decoder architecture, enabling the identification of interpretable, high-resolution embeddings. Furthermore, SpaHDmap can simultaneously analyze multiple samples and is compatible with various types of histology images. Extensive evaluations on synthetic and real ST datasets from various technologies and tissue types demonstrate that SpaHDmap can effectively produce highly interpretable, high-resolution embeddings, and detects refined spatial structures.

These alterations adversely impact transcriptional programs and cause profound changes in gene expression. Interpreting somatic alterations within context-specific transcriptional programs will facilitate personalized therapeutic decisions but is a monumental task. Toward this goal, we develop a partially interpretable neural network model called Chromatin-informed Inference of Transcriptional Regulators Using Self-attention mechanism (CITRUS). CITRUS models the impact of somatic alterations on transcription factors and downstream transcriptional programs. Our approach employs a self-attention mechanism to model the contextual impact of somatic alterations. Furthermore, CITRUS uses a layer of hidden nodes to explicitly represent the state of transcription factors (TFs) to learn the relationships between TFs and their target genes based on TF binding motifs in the open chromatin regions of tumor samples. We apply CITRUS to genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic data from 17 cancer types profiled by The Cancer Genome Atlas. CITRUS predicts patient-specific TF activities and reveals transcriptional program variations between and within tumor types. We show that CITRUS yields biological insights into delineating TFs associated with somatic alterations in individual tumors. Thus, CITRUS is a promising tool for precision oncology.},

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to develop explainable ML models to predict in-hospital mortality in patients hospitalized for myocardial infarction (MI). METHODS: Adult patients hospitalized for an MI were identified in the National Inpatient Sample between January 1, 2012, and September 30, 2015. The resulting cohort comprised 457,096 patients described by 64 predictor variables relating to demographic/comorbidity characteristics and in-hospital complications. The gradient boosting algorithm eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) was used to develop explainable models for in-hospital mortality prediction in the overall cohort and patient subgroups based on MI type and/or sex. RESULTS: The resulting models exhibited an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) ranging from 0.876 to 0.942, specificity 82\% to 87\%, and sensitivity 75\% to 87\%. All models exhibited high negative predictive value {$\geq$}0.974. The SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) framework was applied to explain the models. The top predictor variables of increasing and decreasing mortality were age and undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, respectively. Other notable findings included a decreased mortality risk associated with certain patient subpopulations with hyperlipidemia and a comparatively greater risk of death among women below age 55 years. CONCLUSION: The literature lacks explainable ML models predicting in-hospital mortality after an MI. In a national registry, explainable ML models performed best in ruling out in-hospital death post-MI, and their explanation illustrated their potential for guiding hypothesis generation and future study design.},

The prediction of survival outcomes based on treatment modalities, i.e., chemotherapy, hormone therapy, surgery, and radiation therapy is an essential step towards personalization in treatment planning. However, Machine Learning (ML) models may improve these predictions by investigating intricate relationships between clinical variables and survival. This study investigates the performance of several ML models to predict survival rate in patients undergoing diverse breast cancer treatments i.e., chemotherapy, hormone therapy, surgery and radiation using multiple clinical parameters. The dataset consisted of 5000 samples and turned into downloaded from Kaggle. The models assessed blanketed Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XG boost), and Decision tree. Performance of the models was assessed using parameters such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score and Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC). SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values analysis was done to provide an explanation for the impact of a feature on model predictions using Waterfall and Beeswarm plots. Anticipated baseline (E(f(x))) were in comparison to the predictions (f(x)) for each therapy group. Performance of Gradient Boosting was shown to be the best with an Accuracy: 0.972, Precision: 0.973, Recall: 0.972, F1-Score: 0.973, and AUC-ROC Score: 0.997.

Surgical operation had an extraordinarily impartial impact (f(x) = -0.041), even as radiation therapy positively impacted survival results with an f(x) of 0.22. Gradient Boosting was the most predictive algorithm for breast cancer survival outcomes. This SHAP-primarily based analysis provides a complete knowledge of ways one-of-a-kind treatments have an effect on survival predictions in breast cancer patients. Radiation therapy indicates the most tremendous effect on survival, whilst hormone therapy reveals the maximum poor effect. Future studies need to explore personalized treatment strategies that comprise these insights to enhance patient effects.},

  abstract = {Purpose               The overall survival of patients with pancreatic cancer is extremely low. We aimed to establish machine learning (ML) based model to accurately predict three-year survival and prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients.                                         Methods               We analyzed pancreatic cancer patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database between 2000 and 2021. Univariate and multivariate logistic analysis were employed to select variables. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) method based on 6 ML algorithms was utilized in feature selection. To construct predictive model, 13 ML algorithms were evaluated by area under the curve (AUC), area under precision-recall curve (PRAUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, cross-entropy, Brier scores and Balanced Accuracy (bacc) and F Beta Score (fbeta). An optimal ML model was constructed to predict three-year survival, and the predictive results were explained by SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) framework. Meanwhile, 101 ML algorithm combinations were developed to select the best model with highest C-index to predict prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients.                                         Results               A total of 20,064 pancreatic cancer patients from SEER database was consecutively enrolled. We utilized eight clinical variables to establish prediction model for three-year survival. CatBoost model was selected as the best prediction model, and AUC was 0.932 [0.924, 0.939], 0.899 [0.873, 0.934] and 0.826 [0.735, 0.919] in training, internal test and external test sets, with 0.839 [0.831, 0.847] accuracy, 0.872 [0.858, 0.887] sensitivity, 0.803 [0.784, 0.825] specificity and 0.832 [0.821, 0.853] precision. Surgery type had the greatest effects on three-year survival according to SHAP results. For prognosis prediction, ``RSF+GBM'' algorithm was the best prognostic model with C-index of 0.774, 0.722 and 0.674 in training, internal test and external test sets.                                         Conclusions               Our ML models demonstrate excellent accuracy and reliability, offering more precise personalized prognostic prediction to pancreatic cancer patients.},

  abstract = {Transferring the reasoning capability from stronger large language models (LLMs) to smaller ones has been quite appealing, as smaller LLMs are more flexible to deploy with less expense. Among the existing solutions, knowledge distillation stands out due to its outstanding efficiency and generalization. However, existing methods suffer from several drawbacks, including limited knowledge diversity and the lack of rich contextual information. To solve the problems and facilitate the learning of compact language models, we propose TinyLLM, a new knowledge distillation paradigm to learn a small student LLM from multiple large teacher LLMs. In particular, we encourage the student LLM to not only generate the correct answers but also understand the rationales behind these answers. Given that different LLMs possess diverse reasoning skills, we guide the student model to assimilate knowledge from various teacher LLMs. We further introduce an in-context example generator and a teacher-forcing Chain-of-Thought strategy to ensure that the rationales are accurate and grounded in contextually appropriate scenarios. Extensive experiments on six datasets across two reasoning tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method. Results show that TinyLLM can outperform large teacher LLMs significantly, despite a considerably smaller model size. The source code is available at: https://github.com/YikunHan42/TinyLLM.},

  abstract = {Recently, artificial intelligence and machine learning in general have demonstrated remarkable performances in many tasks, from image processing to natural language processing, especially with the advent of deep learning (DL). Along with research progress, they have encroached upon many different fields and disciplines. Some of them require high level of accountability and thus transparency, for example, the medical sector. Explanations for machine decisions and predictions are thus needed to justify their reliability. This requires greater interpretability, which often means we need to understand the mechanism underlying the algorithms. Unfortunately, the blackbox nature of the DL is still unresolved, and many machine decisions are still poorly understood. We provide a review on interpretabilities suggested by different research works and categorize them. The different categories show different dimensions in interpretability research, from approaches that provide ``obviously'' interpretable information to the studies of complex patterns. By applying the same categorization to interpretability in medical research, it is hoped that: 1) clinicians and practitioners can subsequently approach these methods with caution; 2) insight into interpretability will be born with more considerations for medical practices; and 3) initiatives to push forward data-based, mathematically grounded, and technically grounded medical education are encouraged.},

Diabetes affects hundreds of millions of people worldwide, many of whom will develop life-threatening complications and die prematurely. Precision medicine can potentially address this enormous problem by accounting for heterogeneity in the etiology, clinical presentation and pathogenesis of common forms of diabetes and risks of complications. This second international consensus report on precision diabetes medicine summarizes the findings from a systematic evidence review across the key pillars of precision medicine (prevention, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis) in four recognized forms of diabetes (monogenic, gestational, type 1, type 2). These reviews address key questions about the translation of precision medicine research into practice. Although not complete, owing to the vast literature on this topic, they revealed opportunities for the immediate or near-term clinical implementation of precision diabetes medicine; furthermore, we expose important gaps in knowledge, focusing on the need to obtain new clinically relevant evidence. Gaps include the need for common standards for clinical readiness, including consideration of cost-effectiveness, health equity, predictive accuracy, liability and accessibility.

Such causal relations can facilitate the identification of potential disease precursors and candidates for drug re-purposing. However, computational methods often lack access to these causal relations. Few approaches have been developed to automatically extract causal relationships between diseases from unstructured text, but they are often only focused on a small number of diseases, lack validation of the extracted causal relations, or do not make their data available.We automatically mined statements asserting a causal relation between diseases from the scientific literature by leveraging lexical patterns. Following automated mining of causal relations, we mapped the diseases to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) identifiers to allow the direct application to clinical data. We provide quantitative and qualitative measures to evaluate the mined causal relations and compare to UK Biobank diagnosis data as a completely independent data source. The validated causal associations were used to create a directed acyclic graph that can be used by causal inference frameworks. We demonstrate the utility of our causal network by performing causal inference using the do-calculus, using relations within the graph to construct and improve polygenic risk scores, and disentangle the pleiotropic effects of variants.The data are available through https://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/causal-relations-between-diseases.},

Existing approaches use ad hoc fixed experimental designs then train machine learning models to impute unobserved combinations. Here we propose BATCHIE, an orthogonal approach that conducts experiments dynamically in batches. BATCHIE uses information theory and probabilistic modeling to design each batch to be maximally informative based on the results of previous experiments. On retrospective experiments from previous large-scale screens, BATCHIE designs rapidly discover highly effective and synergistic combinations. In a prospective combination screen of a library of 206 drugs on a collection of pediatric cancer cell lines, the BATCHIE model accurately predicts unseen combinations and detects synergies after exploring only 4\% of the 1.4M possible experiments. Further, the model identifies a panel of top combinations for Ewing sarcomas, which follow-up validation experiments confirm to be effective, including the rational and translatable top hit of PARP plus topoisomerase I inhibition. These results demonstrate that adaptive experiments can enable large-scale unbiased combination drug screens with a relatively small number of experiments.

  abstract = {Researchers increasingly turn to explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to analyze omics data and gain insights into the underlying biological processes. Yet, given the interdisciplinary nature of the field, many findings have only been shared in their respective research community. An overview of XAI for omics data is needed to highlight promising approaches and help detect common issues. Toward this end, we conducted a systematic mapping study. To identify relevant literature, we queried Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, BioRxiv, MedRxiv and arXiv. Based on keywording, we developed a coding scheme with 10 facets regarding the studies' AI methods, explainability methods and omics data. Our mapping study resulted in 405 included papers published between 2010 and 2023. The inspected papers analyze DNA-based (mostly genomic), transcriptomic, proteomic or metabolomic data by means of neural networks, tree-based methods, statistical methods and further AI methods. The preferred post-hoc explainability methods are feature relevance (n~=\,166) and visual explanation (n~=\,52), while papers using interpretable approaches often resort to the use of transparent models (n~=\,83) or architecture modifications (n~=\,72).

We provide an introduction as well as an overview of such techniques, specifically illustrating their use with single-cell gene expression data. For example, the low dimensional latent representations offered by various approaches, such as variational auto-encoders, are useful to get a better understanding of the relations between observed gene expressions and experimental factors or phenotypes. Furthermore, by providing a generative model for the latent and observed variables, deep generative models can generate synthetic observations, which allow us to assess the uncertainty in the learned representations. While deep generative models are useful to learn the structure of high-dimensional omics data by efficiently capturing non-linear dependencies between genes, they are sometimes difficult to interpret due to their neural network building blocks. More precisely, to understand the relationship between learned latent variables and observed variables, e.g., gene transcript abundances and external phenotypes, is difficult. Therefore, we also illustrate current approaches that allow us to infer the relationship between learned latent variables and observed variables as well as external phenotypes. Thereby, we render deep learning approaches more interpretable. In an application with single-cell gene expression data, we demonstrate the utility of the discussed methods.},

  abstract = {Medical discoveries mainly depend on the capability to process and analyze biological datasets, which inundate the scientific community and are still expanding as the cost of next-generation sequencing technologies is decreasing. Deep learning (DL) is a viable method to exploit this massive data stream since it has advanced quickly with there being successive innovations. However, an obstacle to scientific progress emerges: the difficulty of applying DL to biology, and this because both fields are evolving at a breakneck pace, thus making it hard for an individual to occupy the front lines of both of them. This paper aims to bridge the gap and help computer scientists bring their valuable expertise into the life sciences. This work provides an overview of the most common types of biological data and data representations that are used to train DL models, with additional information on the models themselves and the various tasks that are being tackled. This is the essential information a DL expert with no background in biology needs in order to participate in DL-based research projects in biomedicine, biotechnology, and drug discovery.

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform our healthcare systems significantly. New AI technologies based on machine learning approaches should play a key role in clinical decision-making in the future. However, their implementation in health care settings remains limited, mostly due to a lack of robust validation procedures. There is a need to develop reliable assessment frameworks for the clinical validation of AI. We present here an approach for assessing AI for predicting treatment response in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), using real-world data and molecular -omics data from clinical data warehouses and biobanks.                                         Methods               The European ``ITFoC (Information Technology for the Future Of Cancer)'' consortium designed a framework for the clinical validation of AI technologies for predicting treatment response in oncology.                                         Results               This framework is based on seven key steps specifying: (1) the intended use of AI, (2) the target population, (3) the timing of AI evaluation, (4) the datasets used for evaluation, (5) the procedures used for ensuring data safety (including data quality, privacy and security), (6) the metrics used for measuring performance, and (7) the procedures used to ensure that the AI is explainable. This framework forms the basis of a validation platform that we are building for the ``ITFoC Challenge''. This community-wide competition will make it possible to assess and compare AI algorithms for predicting the response to TNBC treatments with external real-world datasets.                                         Conclusions               The predictive performance and safety of AI technologies must be assessed in a robust, unbiased and transparent manner before their implementation in healthcare settings. We believe that the consideration of the ITFoC consortium will contribute to the safe transfer and implementation of AI in clinical settings, in the context of precision oncology and personalized care.},

Several post-hoc methods have emerged in recent years but they produce different results when applied to a given task, raising the question of which method is the most suitable to provide accurate post-hoc interpretability. To understand the performance of each method, quantitative evaluation of interpretability methods is essential; however, currently available frameworks have several drawbacks that hinder the adoption of post-hoc interpretability methods, especially in high-risk sectors. In this work we propose a framework with quantitative metrics to assess the performance of existing post-hoc interpretability methods, particularly in time-series classification. We show that several drawbacks identified in the literature are addressed, namely, the dependence on human judgement, retraining and the shift in the data distribution when occluding samples. We also design a synthetic dataset with known discriminative features and tunable complexity. The proposed methodology and quantitative metrics can be used to understand the reliability of interpretability methods results obtained in practical applications. In turn, they can be embedded within operational workflows in critical fields that require accurate interpretability results for, example, regulatory policies.},

  abstract = {The recent success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) attracts much attention to applying a computer-aided diagnosis system for digital pathology. However, the basis of CNN's decision is incomprehensible for humans due to its complexity, and this will reduce the reliability of its decision. We improve the interpretability of the decision made using the CNN by presenting them as co-occurrences of interpretable components which typically appeared in parts of images. To this end, we propose a prototype-based interpretation method and define prototypes as the components. The method comprises the following three approaches: (1) presenting typical parts of images as multiple components, (2) allowing humans to interpret the components visually, and (3) making decisions based on the co-occurrence relation of the multiple components. Concretely, we first encode image patches using the encoder of a variational auto-encoder (VAE) and construct clusters for the encoded image patches to obtain prototypes. We then decode prototypes into images using the VAE's decoder to make the prototypes visually interpretable. Finally, we calculate the weighted combinations of the prototype occurrences for image-level classification. The weights enable us to ascertain the prototypes that contributed to decision-making. We verified both the interpretability and classification performance of our method through experiments using two types of datasets. The proposed method showed a significant advantage for interpretation by displaying the association between class discriminative components in an image and the prototypes.},

This study~evaluates the efficacy of a compact navigation system with smart delivery tools in percutaneous pedicle screw insertion. Methods This retrospective observational study included consecutive thoracic or lumbar spinal fusion patients with percutaneous pedicle screw placement treated from November 2022 to July 2023 in a Japanese private hospital. Primary outcomes were screw deviations (classified as any deviation, deviations of more than 2 mm, deviations from the medial to the caudal side). Pedicle screws were divided into two groups: those placed with the navigation system and those placed with traditional fluoroscopic guidance (non-navigation). Fisher's exact test and a generalized estimation equation for the prevalence ratio were conducted, adjusting for potential confounders. Results This study evaluated 492 pedicle screws (190 in the navigation group) in 78 patients. The median age was 70.5 years, and the most common condition was foraminal stenosis (26 patients, 33\%). Of the study participants, 40 (51\%) were male. Any deviation, deviations of more than 2 mm, and deviations from the medial to the caudal side were observed in 16 screws (8.4\%) vs. 54 screws (21\%) (p{$<$}0.001), six screws (3.2\%) vs. 31 screws (12\%) (p{$<$}0.001), and five screws (2.6\%) vs. 10 screws (3.8\%) (p=0.5) in the navigation and non-navigation groups, respectively. The adjusted prevalence ratios of the navigation group for any deviation, deviations of more than 2 mm, and deviations from the medial to the caudal side were 0.51 (95\%CI 0.27, 0.98), 0.33 (95\%CI 0.14, 0.78), and 0.88 (95\%CI 0.26, 3.05), respectively.

The increasingly used data analysis from Single nucleus RNA Sequencing (snRNA-seq) allows to explore transcriptomic events at a single cell level, yet face challenges in interpreting the mechanisms underlying a disease. On the other hand, Neural Network (NN) models can handle complex data to offer insights but can be seen as black boxes with poor interpretability. In this context, explainable AI (XAI) emerges as a solution that could help to understand disease-associated mechanisms when combined with efficient NN models. However, limited research explores XAI in single-cell data. In this work, we implement a method for identifying disease-related genes and the mechanistic explanation of disease progression based on NN model combined with SHAP. We analyze available Huntington's disease (HD) data to identify both HD-altered genes and mechanisms by adding Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) comparing two methods, differential gene expression analysis (DGE) and NN combined with SHAP approach. Our results show that DGE and SHAP approaches offer both common and differential sets of altered genes and pathways, reinforcing the usefulness of XAI methods for a broader perspective of disease.},

  abstract = {Abstract               Deep learning applications have had a profound impact on many scientific fields, including functional genomics. Deep learning models can learn complex interactions between and within omics data; however, interpreting and explaining these models can be challenging. Interpretability is essential not only to help progress our understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying traits and diseases but also for establishing trust in these model's efficacy for healthcare applications. Recognizing this importance, recent years have seen the development of numerous diverse interpretability strategies, making it increasingly difficult to navigate the field. In this review, we present a quantitative analysis of the challenges arising when designing interpretable deep learning solutions in functional genomics. We explore design choices related to the characteristics of genomics data, the neural network architectures applied, and strategies for interpretation. By quantifying the current state of the field with a predefined set of criteria, we find the most frequent solutions, highlight exceptional examples, and identify unexplored opportunities for developing interpretable deep learning models in genomics.},

  abstract = {Background Multiple commercial artificial intelligence (AI) products exist for                             assessing radiographs; however, comparable performance data for these                             algorithms are limited.Purpose To perform an independent, stand-alone validation of commercially                             available AI products for bone age prediction based on hand radiographs                             and lung nodule detection on chest radiographs.Materials and Methods This retrospective study was carried out as part of Project AIR. Nine of                             17 eligible AI products were validated on data from seven Dutch                             hospitals. For bone age prediction, the root mean square error (RMSE)                             and Pearson correlation coefficient were computed. The reference                             standard was set by three to five expert readers. For lung nodule                             detection, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve                             (AUC) was computed. The reference standard was set by a chest                             radiologist based on CT. Randomized subsets of hand (n                             = 95) and chest (n = 140) radiographs were read by 14                             and 17 human readers, respectively, with varying experience.Results Two bone age prediction algorithms were tested on hand radiographs (from                             January 2017 to January 2022) in 326 patients (mean age, 10 years                             {\textpm} 4 [SD]; 173 female patients) and correlated strongly with the                             reference standard (r = 0.99; P                             {$<$} .001 for both). No difference in RMSE was observed between                             algorithms (0.63 years [95\% CI: 0.58, 0.69] and 0.57 years [95\% CI:                             0.52, 0.61]) and readers (0.68 years [95\% CI: 0.64, 0.73]). Seven lung                             nodule detection algorithms were validated on chest radiographs (from                             January 2012 to May 2022) in 386 patients (mean age, 64 years {\textpm}                             11; 223 male patients). Compared with readers (mean AUC, 0.81 [95\% CI:                             0.77, 0.85]), four algorithms performed better (AUC range,                             0.86--0.93; P value range, {$<$}.001 to                             .04).Conclusions Compared with human readers, four AI algorithms for detecting lung                             nodules on chest radiographs showed improved performance, whereas the                             remaining algorithms tested showed no evidence of a difference in                             performance. {\copyright} RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this                                     article.

  abstract = {At the core of causal inference lies the challenge of determining reliable causal graphs solely based on observational data. Since the well-known backdoor criterion depends on the graph, any errors in the graph can propagate downstream to effect inference. In this work, we initially show that complete graph information is not necessary for causal effect inference; the topological order over graph variables (causal order) alone suffices. Further, given a node pair, causal order is easier to elicit from domain experts compared to graph edges since determining the existence of an edge can depend extensively on other variables. Interestingly, we find that the same principle holds for Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4, motivating an automated method to obtain causal order (and hence causal effect) with LLMs acting as virtual domain experts. To this end, we employ different prompting strategies and contextual cues to propose a robust technique of obtaining causal order from LLMs. Acknowledging LLMs' limitations, we also study possible techniques to integrate LLMs with established causal discovery algorithms, including constraint-based and score-based methods, to enhance their performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves causal ordering accuracy as compared to discovery algorithms, highlighting the potential of LLMs to enhance causal inference across diverse fields.},

  abstract = {Personalized medicine is a concept that has been subject of increasing interest in medical research and practice in the last few years. However, significant challenges stand in the way of practical implementations, namely in regard to extracting clinically valuable insights from the vast amount of biomedical knowledge generated in the last few years. Here, we describe an approach that uses Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) methods on a biomedical Knowledge Graph (KG) as a path to reasoning over the wealth of information stored in publicly accessible databases. We built a Knowledge Graph using data from DisGeNET and GO, containing relationships between genes, diseases and other biological entities. The KG contains 93,657 nodes of 5 types and 1,705,585 relationships of 59 types. We applied KGE methods to this KG, obtaining an excellent performance in predicting gene-disease associations (MR 0.13, MRR 0.96, HITS@1 0.93, HITS@3 0.99, and HITS@10 0.99). The optimal hyperparameter set was used to predict all possible novel gene-disease associations. An in-depth analysis of novel gene-disease predictions for disease terms related to Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) shows that this approach produces predictions consistent with known candidate genes and biological pathways and yields relevant insights into the biology of this paradigmatic complex disorder.},

However, infrequent pathologies affect a large number of people, since according to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are about 7000 rare diseases that affect 7\% of the world's population. Many patients with rare diseases have suffered the consequences of what is called the diagnostic odyssey, that is, extensive and prolonged serial tests and clinical visits, sometimes for many years, all with the hope of identifying the etiology of their disease. For patients with rare diseases, obtaining the genetic diagnosis can mean the end of the diagnostic odyssey, and the beginning of another, the therapeutic odyssey. This scenario is especially challenging for the scientific community, since more than 90\% of rare diseases do not currently have an effective treatment. This therapeutic failure in rare diseases means that new approaches are necessary. Our research group proposes that the use of precision or personalized medicine techniques can be an alternative to find potential therapies in these diseases. To this end, we propose that patients' own cells can be used to carry out personalized pharmacological screening for the identification of potential treatments.},

  abstract = {Counterfactual inference is a powerful tool, capable of solving challenging problems in high-profile sectors. To perform counterfactual inference, we require knowledge of the underlying causal mechanisms. However, causal mechanisms cannot be uniquely determined from observations and interventions alone. This raises the question of how to choose the causal mechanisms so that the resulting counterfactual inference is trustworthy in a given domain. This question has been addressed in causal models with binary variables, but for the case of categorical variables, it remains unanswered. We address this challenge by introducing for causal models with categorical variables the notion of counterfactual ordering, a principle positing desirable properties that causal mechanisms should possess and prove that it is equivalent to specific functional constraints on the causal mechanisms. To learn causal mechanisms satisfying these constraints, and perform counterfactual inference with them, we introduce deep twin networks. These are deep neural networks that, when trained, are capable of twin network counterfactual inference---an alternative to the abduction--action--prediction method. We empirically test our approach on diverse real-world and semisynthetic data from medicine, epidemiology and finance, reporting accurate estimation of counterfactual probabilities while demonstrating the issues that arise with counterfactual reasoning when counterfactual ordering is not enforced},

However, there exists a notable lack of clinician trust in AI models, underscoring the need for effective uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods. The purpose of this study was to scope existing literature related to UQ in RT, identify areas of improvement, and determine future directions. METHODS: We followed the PRISMA-ScR scoping review reporting guidelines. We utilized the population (human cancer patients), concept (utilization of AI UQ), context (radiotherapy applications) framework to structure our search and screening process. We conducted a systematic search spanning seven databases, supplemented by manual curation, up to January 2024. Our search yielded a total of 8980 articles for initial review. Manuscript screening and data extraction was performed in Covidence. Data extraction categories included general study characteristics, RT characteristics, AI characteristics, and UQ characteristics. RESULTS: We identified 56 articles published from 2015-2024. 10 domains of RT applications were represented; most studies evaluated auto-contouring (50\%), followed by image-synthesis (13\%), and multiple applications simultaneously (11\%). 12 disease sites were represented, with head and neck cancer being the most common disease site independent of application space (32\%). Imaging data was used in 91\% of studies, while only 13\% incorporated RT dose information. Most studies focused on failure detection as the main application of UQ (60\%), with Monte Carlo dropout being the most commonly implemented UQ method (32\%) followed by ensembling (16\%). 55\% of studies did not share code or datasets. CONCLUSION: Our review revealed a lack of diversity in UQ for RT applications beyond auto-contouring. Moreover, there was a clear need to study additional UQ methods, such as conformal prediction. Our results may incentivize the development of guidelines for reporting and implementation of UQ in RT.},

Yet, reading a chest X-ray image remains a challenging job for learning-oriented machine intelligence, due to (1) shortage of large-scale machine-learnable medical image datasets, and (2) lack of techniques that can mimic the high-level reasoning of human radiologists that requires years of knowledge accumulation and professional training. In this paper, we show the clinical free-text radiological reports can be utilized as a priori knowledge for tackling these two key problems. We propose a novel Text-Image Embedding network (TieNet) for extracting the distinctive image and text representations. Multi-level attention models are integrated into an end-to-end trainable CNN-RNN architecture for highlighting the meaningful text words and image regions. We first apply TieNet to classify the chest X-rays by using both image features and text embeddings extracted from associated reports. The proposed auto-annotation framework achieves high accuracy (over 0.9 on average in AUCs) in assigning disease labels for our hand-label evaluation dataset. Furthermore, we transform the TieNet into a chest X-ray reporting system. It simulates the reporting process and can output disease classification and a preliminary report together. The classification results are significantly improved (6\% increase on average in AUCs) compared to the state-of-the-art baseline on an unseen and hand-labeled dataset (OpenI).},

Manual-based causality assessment from a large number of free text-based documents is very time-consuming, labor-intensive, and sometimes even impractical. Herein, we proposed a general causal inference framework named DeepCausality to empirically estimate the causal factors for suspected endpoints embedded in the free text. The proposed DeepCausality seamlessly incorporates AI-powered language models, named entity recognition and Judea Pearl's Do-calculus, into a general framework for causal inference to fulfill different domain-specific applications. We exemplified the utility of the proposed DeepCausality framework by employing the LiverTox database to estimate idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (DILI)-related causal terms and generate a knowledge-based causal tree for idiosyncratic DILI patient stratification. Consequently, the DeepCausality yielded a prediction performance with an accuracy of 0.92 and an F-score of 0.84 for the DILI prediction. Notably, 90\% of causal terms enriched by the DeepCausality were consistent with the clinical causal terms defined by the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) clinical guideline for evaluating suspected idiosyncratic DILI (iDILI). Furthermore, we observed a high concordance of 0.91 between the iDILI severity scores generated by DeepCausality and domain experts.

Though many computer-aided methods, especially deep learning methods, have made remarkable achievements in skin lesion diagnosis, their generalization and interpretability are still a challenge. To solve this issue, we propose an interpretability-based multimodal convolutional neural network (IM-CNN), which is a multiclass classification model with skin lesion images and metadata of patients as input for skin lesion diagnosis. The structure of IM-CNN consists of three main paths to deal with metadata, features extracted from segmented skin lesion with domain knowledge, and skin lesion images, respectively. We add interpretable visual modules to provide explanations for both images and metadata. In addition to area under the ROC curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity, we introduce a new indicator, an AUC curve with a sensitivity larger than 80\% (AUC\_SEN\_80) for performance evaluation. Extensive experimental studies are conducted on the popular HAM10000 dataset, and the results indicate that the proposed model has overwhelming advantages compared with popular deep learning models, such as DenseNet, ResNet, and other state-of-the-art models for melanoma diagnosis. The proposed multimodal model also achieves on average 72\% and 21\% improvement in terms of sensitivity and AUC\_SEN\_80, respectively, compared with the single-modal model. The visual explanations can also help gain trust from dermatologists and realize man--machine collaborations, effectively reducing the limitation of black-box models in supporting medical decision making.},

However, challenges caused by noises, technical errors, and dropout phenomena in scRNA-seq data pose significant obstacles to GRN inference, making the design of accurate GRN inference algorithms still essential. The recent growth of both single-cell and spatial transcriptomic sequencing data enables the development of supervised deep learning methods to infer GRNs on these diverse single-cell datasets.In this study, we introduce a novel deep learning framework based on shared factor neighborhood and integrated neural network (SFINN) for inferring potential interactions and causalities between transcription factors and target genes from single-cell and spatial transcriptomic data. SFINN utilizes shared factor neighborhood to construct cellular neighborhood network based on gene expression data and additionally integrates cellular network generated from spatial location information. Subsequently, the cell adjacency matrix and gene pair expression are fed into an integrated neural network framework consisting of a graph convolutional neural network and a fully-connected neural network to determine whether the genes interact. Performance evaluation in the tasks of gene interaction and causality prediction against the existing GRN reconstruction algorithms demonstrates the usability and competitiveness of SFINN across different kinds of data. SFINN can be applied to infer GRNs from conventional single-cell sequencing data and spatial transcriptomic data.SFINN can be accessed at GitHub: https://github.com/JGuan-lab/SFINN.},

In the context of infectious diseases, ECG classification is particularly critical, as many infections, such as viral myocarditis and sepsis, can cause significant cardiac complications. Early detection of infection-induced cardiac abnormalities through ECG can provide timely intervention and improve patient outcomes. However, current ECG processing methods often overlook the impact of confounding factors caused by statistical associations, which can compromise classification accuracy, especially in infection-related cardiac conditions. To address this, we propose an innovative approach to causal reasoning based on attention mechanisms. By employing backdoor adjustment for each cardiac lead, our method effectively eliminates confounding factors and models the true causal relationship between ECG patterns and underlying cardiac abnormalities caused by infectious diseases. Furthermore, our approach integrates the concept of entropy with causal inference to enhance ECG classification. By quantifying the information content and variability in ECG signals, we can better identify patterns and anomalies associated with infection-induced cardiac conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements in classification accuracy and robustness across four benchmark ECG datasets, outperforming existing methods. This work provides a novel perspective on the interplay between infection and cardiac function, offering valuable insights into the detection and understanding of infection-related cardiac complications.},

On five text classification tasks, we show that EDA improves performance for both convolutional and recurrent neural networks. EDA demonstrates particularly strong results for smaller datasets; on average, across five datasets, training with EDA while using only 50\% of the available training set achieved the same accuracy as normal training with all available data. We also performed extensive ablation studies and suggest parameters for practical use.},

In particular, we show how such reasoning abilities emerge naturally in sufficiently large language models via a simple method called chain of thought prompting, where a few chain of thought demonstrations are provided as exemplars in prompting. Experiments on three large language models show that chain of thought prompting improves performance on a range of arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks. The empirical gains can be striking. For instance, prompting a 540B-parameter language model with just eight chain of thought exemplars achieves state of the art accuracy on the GSM8K benchmark of math word problems, surpassing even finetuned GPT-3 with a verifier.},

However, evaluating and choosing causal discovery methods and developing and performing proper workflow remain challenges. We report the workflow and platform CausalCell (http://www.gaemons.net/causalcell/causalDiscovery/) for performing single-cell causal discovery. The workflow/platform is developed upon benchmarking four kinds of causal discovery methods and is examined by analyzing multiple single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets. Our results suggest that different situations need different methods and the constraint-based PC algorithm with kernel-based conditional independence tests work best in most situations. Related issues are discussed and tips for best practices are given. Inferred causal interactions in single cells provide valuable clues for investigating molecular interactions and gene regulations, identifying critical diagnostic and therapeutic targets, and designing experimental and clinical interventions.},

Compared with existing methods, we show that the proposed AutoCI allows one to clearly determine the causal variables of two real-world RCTs of patients with endometrial cancer with mature outcome and extensive clinicopathological and molecular data. This is achieved via suppressing the causal probability of non-causal variables by a wide margin. In ablation studies, we further demonstrate that the assignment of causal probabilities by AutoCI remains consistent in the presence of confounders. In conclusion, these results confirm the robustness and feasibility of AutoCI for future applications in real-world clinical analysis.},

Here we present the Corrformer model with a novel multi-correlation mechanism, which unifies spatial cross-correlation and temporal auto-correlation into a learned multi-scale tree structure to capture worldwide spatiotemporal correlations. Corrformer reduces the canonical double quadratic complexity of spatiotemporal modelling to linear in spatial modelling and log-linear in temporal modelling, achieving collaborative forecasts for tens of thousands of stations within a unified deep model. Our model can generate interpretable predictions based on inferred propagation directions of weather processes, facilitating a fully data-driven artificial intelligence paradigm for discovering insights for meteorological science. Corrformer yields state-of-the-art forecasts on global, regional and citywide datasets with high confidence and provided skilful weather services for the 2022 Winter Olympics.},

  abstract = {While the pace of development of AI has rapidly progressed in recent years, the implementation of safe and effective regulatory frameworks has lagged behind. In particular, the adaptive nature of AI models presents unique challenges to regulators as updating a model can improve its performance but also introduce safety risks. In the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been a forerunner in regulating and approving hundreds of AI medical devices. To better understand how AI is updated and its regulatory considerations, we systematically analyze the frequency and nature of updates in FDA-approved AI medical devices. We find that less than 2\% of all devices report having been updated by being re-trained on new data. Meanwhile, nearly a quarter of devices report updates in the form of new functionality and marketing claims. As an illustrative case study, we analyze pneumothorax detection models and find that while model performance can degrade by as much as 0.18 AUC when evaluated on new sites, re-training on site-specific data can mitigate this performance drop, recovering up to 0.23 AUC. However, we also observed significant degradation on the original site after retraining using data from new sites, providing insight from one example that challenges the current one-model-fits-all approach to regulatory approvals. Our analysis provides an in-depth look at the current state of FDA-approved AI device updates and insights for future regulatory policies toward model updating and adaptive AI.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) has developed rapidly, and its application extends to clinical decision support system (CDSS) for improving healthcare quality. However, the interpretability of AI-driven CDSS poses significant challenges to widespread application. OBJECTIVE: This study is a review of the knowledge-based and data-based CDSS literature regarding interpretability in health care. It highlights the relevance of interpretability for CDSS and the area for improvement from technological and medical perspectives. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted on the interpretability-related literature published from 2011 to 2020 and indexed in the five databases: Web of Science, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Cochrane, and Scopus. Journal articles that focus on the interpretability of CDSS were included for analysis. Experienced researchers also participated in manually reviewing the selected articles for inclusion/exclusion and categorization. RESULTS: Based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 20 articles from 16 journals were finally selected for this review. Interpretability, which means a transparent structure of the model, a clear relationship between input and output, and explainability of artificial intelligence algorithms, is essential for CDSS application in the healthcare setting. Methods for improving the interpretability of CDSS include ante-hoc methods such as fuzzy logic, decision rules, logistic regression, decision trees for knowledge-based AI, and white box models, post hoc methods such as feature importance, sensitivity analysis, visualization, and activation maximization for black box models. A number of factors, such as data type, biomarkers, human-AI interaction, needs of clinicians, and patients, can affect the interpretability of CDSS. CONCLUSIONS: The review explores the meaning of the interpretability of CDSS and summarizes the current methods for improving interpretability from technological and medical perspectives. The results contribute to the understanding of the interpretability of CDSS based on AI in health care. Future studies should focus on establishing formalism for defining interpretability, identifying the properties of interpretability, and developing an appropriate and objective metric for interpretability; in addition, the user's demand for interpretability and how to express and provide explanations are also the directions for future research.},

Additionally, as open-source LLMs flourish, KD plays a crucial role in both compressing these models, and facilitating their self-improvement by employing themselves as teachers. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of KD's role within the realm of LLM, highlighting its critical function in imparting advanced knowledge to smaller models and its utility in model compression and self-improvement. Our survey is meticulously structured around three foundational pillars: {\textbackslash}textit\{algorithm\}, {\textbackslash}textit\{skill\}, and {\textbackslash}textit\{verticalization\} -- providing a comprehensive examination of KD mechanisms, the enhancement of specific cognitive abilities, and their practical implications across diverse fields. Crucially, the survey navigates the intricate interplay between data augmentation (DA) and KD, illustrating how DA emerges as a powerful paradigm within the KD framework to bolster LLMs' performance. By leveraging DA to generate context-rich, skill-specific training data, KD transcends traditional boundaries, enabling open-source models to approximate the contextual adeptness, ethical alignment, and deep semantic insights characteristic of their proprietary counterparts. This work aims to provide an insightful guide for researchers and practitioners, offering a detailed overview of current methodologies in KD and proposing future research directions. Importantly, we firmly advocate for compliance with the legal terms that regulate the use of LLMs, ensuring ethical and lawful application of KD of LLMs. An associated Github repository is available at https://github.com/Tebmer/Awesome-Knowledge-Distillation-of-LLMs.},

  abstract = {Explainable AI (XAI) is critical for ensuring transparency, accountability, and trust in machine learning systems as black-box models are increasingly deployed within high-stakes domains. Among XAI methods, Shapley values are widely used for their fairness and consistency axioms. However, prevalent Shapley value approximation methods commonly rely on abstract baselines or computationally intensive calculations, which can limit their interpretability and scalability. To address such challenges, we propose Pairwise Shapley Values, a novel framework that grounds feature attributions in explicit, human-relatable comparisons between pairs of data instances proximal in feature space. Our method introduces pairwise reference selection combined with single-value imputation to deliver intuitive, model-agnostic explanations while significantly reducing computational overhead. Here, we demonstrate that Pairwise Shapley Values enhance interpretability across diverse regression and classification scenarios--including real estate pricing, polymer property prediction, and drug discovery datasets. We conclude that the proposed methods enable more transparent AI systems and advance the real-world applicability of XAI.},

  abstract = {Understanding causality in medical research is essential for developing effective interventions and diagnostic tools. Mendelian Randomization (MR) is a pivotal method for inferring causality through genetic data. However, MR analysis often requires pre-identification of exposure-outcome pairs from clinical experience or literature, which can be challenging to obtain. This poses difficulties for clinicians investigating causal factors of specific diseases. To address this, we introduce MRAgent, an innovative automated agent leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance causal knowledge discovery in disease research. MRAgent autonomously scans scientific literature, discovers potential exposure-outcome pairs, and performs MR causal inference using extensive Genome-Wide Association Study data. We conducted both automated and human evaluations to compare different LLMs in operating MRAgent and provided a proof-of-concept case to demonstrate the complete workflow. MRAgent's capability to conduct large-scale causal analyses represents a significant advancement, equipping researchers and clinicians with a robust tool for exploring and validating causal relationships in complex diseases. Our code is public at https://github.com/xuwei1997/MRAgent.},

While pathology foundation models leveraging AI have catalyzed transformative advancements, their development demands large-scale datasets, considerable storage capacity, and substantial computational resources. Furthermore, ensuring their clinical applicability and generalizability requires rigorous validation across a broad spectrum of clinical tasks. Here, we present PathOrchestra, a versatile pathology foundation model trained via self-supervised learning on a dataset comprising 300K pathological slides from 20 tissue and organ types across multiple centers. The model was rigorously evaluated on 112 clinical tasks using a combination of 61 private and 51 public datasets. These tasks encompass digital slide preprocessing, pan-cancer classification, lesion identification, multi-cancer subtype classification, biomarker assessment, gene expression prediction, and the generation of structured reports. PathOrchestra demonstrated exceptional performance across 27,755 WSIs and 9,415,729 ROIs, achieving over 0.950 accuracy in 47 tasks, including pan-cancer classification across various organs, lymphoma subtype diagnosis, and bladder cancer screening. Notably, it is the first model to generate structured reports for high-incidence colorectal cancer and diagnostically complex lymphoma-areas that are infrequently addressed by foundational models but hold immense clinical potential. Overall, PathOrchestra exemplifies the feasibility and efficacy of a large-scale, self-supervised pathology foundation model, validated across a broad range of clinical-grade tasks. Its high accuracy and reduced reliance on extensive data annotation underline its potential for clinical integration, offering a pathway toward more efficient and high-quality medical services.},

This research field inspects the measures and models involved in decision-making and seeks solutions to explain them explicitly. Many of the machine learning algorithms cannot manifest how and why a decision has been cast. This is particularly true of the most popular deep neural network approaches currently in use. Consequently, our confidence in AI systems can be hindered by the lack of explainability in these black-box models. The XAI becomes more and more crucial for deep learning powered applications, especially for medical and healthcare studies, although in general these deep neural networks can return an arresting dividend in performance. The insufficient explainability and transparency in most existing AI systems can be one of the major reasons that successful implementation and integration of AI tools into routine clinical practice are uncommon. In this study, we first surveyed the current progress of XAI and in particular its advances in healthcare applications. We then introduced our solutions for XAI leveraging multi-modal and multi-centre data fusion, and subsequently validated in two showcases following real clinical scenarios. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses can prove the efficacy of our proposed XAI solutions, from which we can envisage successful applications in a broader range of clinical questions.},

The advent of AF2 presents an unprecedented progress in protein structure prediction and has attracted much attention. Subsequent release of structures of more than 200 million proteins predicted by AF2 further aroused great enthusiasm in the science community, especially in the fields of biology and medicine. AF2 is thought to have a significant impact on structural biology and research areas that need protein structure information, such as drug discovery, protein design, prediction of protein function, et al. Though the time is not long since AF2 was developed, there are already quite a few application studies of AF2 in the fields of biology and medicine, with many of them having preliminarily proved the potential of AF2. To better understand AF2 and promote its applications, we will in this article summarize the principle and system architecture of AF2 as well as the recipe of its success, and particularly focus on reviewing its applications in the fields of biology and medicine. Limitations of current AF2 prediction will also be discussed.},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have shown incredible performance in completing various real-world tasks. The current paradigm of knowledge learning for LLMs is mainly based on learning from examples, in which LLMs learn the internal rule implicitly from a certain number of supervised examples. However, this learning paradigm may not well learn those complicated rules, especially when the training examples are limited. We are inspired that humans can learn the new tasks or knowledge in another way by learning from rules. That is, humans can learn new tasks or grasp new knowledge quickly and generalize well given only a detailed rule and a few optional examples. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to explore the feasibility of this new learning paradigm, which targets on encoding rule-based knowledge into LLMs. We further propose rule distillation, which first uses the strong in-context abilities of LLMs to extract the knowledge from the textual rules, and then explicitly encode the knowledge into the parameters of LLMs by learning from the above in-context signals produced inside the model. Our experiments show that making LLMs learn from rules by our method is much more efficient than example-based learning in both the sample size and generalization ability.

The patients were enrolled in a clinical trial with randomized treatment, either cetuximab or bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy. We linked the network to overall survival (OS) and detected novel biomarkers by controlling for confounding genes. Our data-driven approach discerned sets of genes, each set collectively stratify patients based on OS. Two signatures under the cetuximab treatment were related to wound healing and macrophages. The signature under the bevacizumab treatment was related to cytotoxicity and we replicated its effect on OS using an external cohort. We also showed that the genes influencing OS within the signatures are downregulated in CRC tumor vs. normal tissue using another external cohort. Furthermore, the corresponding proteins encoded by the genes within the signatures interact each other and are functionally related. In conclusion, this study identified a group of genes that collectively stratified patients based on OS and uncovered promising novel prognostic biomarkers for personalized treatment of CRC using transcriptomic causal networks.},

  abstract = {Identifying and discovering drug-target interactions(DTIs) are vital steps in drug discovery and development. They play a crucial role in assisting scientists in finding new drugs and accelerating the drug development process. Recently, knowledge graph and knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models have made rapid advancements and demonstrated impressive performance in drug discovery. However, such models lack authenticity and accuracy in drug target identification, leading to an increased misjudgment rate and reduced drug development efficiency. To address these issues, we focus on the problem of drug-target interactions, with knowledge mapping as the core technology. Specifically, a causal intervention-based confidence measure is employed to assess the triplet score to improve the accuracy of the drug-target interaction prediction model. Experimental results demonstrate that the developed confidence measurement method based on causal intervention can significantly enhance the accuracy of DTI link prediction, particularly for high-precision models. The predicted results are more valuable in guiding the design and development of subsequent drug development experiments, thereby significantly improving the efficiency of drug development.},

We propose simple robust variants of two notions that have been considered in recent literature: (in)fidelity, and sensitivity. We analyze optimal explanations with respect to both these measures, and while the optimal explanation for sensitivity is a vacuous constant explanation, the optimal explanation for infidelity is a novel combination of two popular explanation methods. By varying the perturbation distribution that defines infidelity, we obtain novel explanations by optimizing infidelity, which we show to out-perform existing explanations in both quantitative and qualitative measurements. Another salient question given these measures is how to modify any given explanation to have better values with respect to these measures. We propose a simple modification based on lowering sensitivity, and moreover show that when done appropriately, we could simultaneously improve both sensitivity as well as fidelity.},

However, incorporating both graph structure and feature information leads to complex models, and explaining predictions made by GNNs remains unsolved. Here we propose GNNExplainer, the first general, model-agnostic approach for providing interpretable explanations for predictions of any GNN-based model on any graph-based machine learning task. Given an instance, GNNExplainer identifies a compact subgraph structure and a small subset of node features that have a crucial role in GNN's prediction. Further, GNNExplainer can generate consistent and concise explanations for an entire class of instances. We formulate GNNExplainer as an optimization task that maximizes the mutual information between a GNN's prediction and distribution of possible subgraph structures. Experiments on synthetic and real-world graphs show that our approach can identify important graph structures as well as node features, and outperforms baselines by 17.1\% on average. GNNExplainer provides a variety of benefits, from the ability to visualize semantically relevant structures to interpretability, to giving insights into errors of faulty GNNs.},

To address this, we developed and evaluated SCORPIO, a machine learning system that utilizes routine blood tests (complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic profile) alongside clinical characteristics from 9,745 ICI-treated patients across 21 cancer types. SCORPIO was trained on data from 1,628 patients across 17 cancer types from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. In two internal test sets comprising 2,511 patients across 19 cancer types, SCORPIO achieved median time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC(t)) values of 0.763 and 0.759 for predicting overall survival at 6, 12, 18, 24 and 30 months, outperforming tumor mutational burden (TMB), which showed median AUC(t) values of 0.503 and 0.543. Additionally, SCORPIO demonstrated superior predictive performance for predicting clinical benefit (tumor response or prolonged stability), with AUC values of 0.714 and 0.641, compared to TMB (AUC\,=\,0.546 and 0.573). External validation was performed using 10 global phase 3 trials (4,447 patients across 6 cancer types) and a real-world cohort from the Mount Sinai Health System (1,159 patients across 18 cancer types). In these external cohorts, SCORPIO maintained robust performance in predicting ICI outcomes, surpassing programmed death-ligand 1 immunostaining. These findings underscore SCORPIO's reliability and adaptability, highlighting its potential to predict patient outcomes with ICI therapy across diverse cancer types and healthcare settings.},

We propose a novel method for inferring ITE based on the Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) framework. Our method, termed Generative Adversarial Nets for inference of Individualized Treatment Effects (GANITE), is motivated by the possibility that we can capture the uncertainty in the counterfactual distributions by attempting to learn them using a GAN. We generate proxies of the counterfactual outcomes using a counterfactual generator, G, and then pass these proxies to an ITE generator, I, in order to train it. By modeling both of these using the GAN framework, we are able to infer based on the factual data, while still accounting for the unseen counterfactuals. We test our method on three real-world datasets (with both binary and multiple treatments) and show that GANITE outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

We hypothesized that lower hemoglobin is correlated with death during hospitalization and 60 to 90 days postdischarge in patients with HF. The Organized Program to Initiate Lifesaving Treatment in Patients with Heart Failure is a registry and performance improvement program for hospitalized patients with HF. Study cohorts were defined by admission hemoglobin quartile. Data from 48,612 patients at 259 hospitals showed that half of the total cohort had low hemoglobin ({$<$}12.1 g/dl) and that 25\% were moderately to severely anemic (lowest hemoglobin quartile, 5 to 10.7 g/dl). Patients with low hemoglobin were older, were more often women and Caucasian, and had preserved systolic function and elevated creatinine. They were also less likely to receive angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta blockers at discharge. Anemic patients had higher in-hospital mortality (4.8\% vs 3.0\%, lowest vs highest quartile), longer hospital length of stay (6.5 vs 5.3 days), and more readmissions by 90 days (33.1\% vs 24.2\%) (all p {$<$}0.0001).

In particular, autoencoders (AE) have been employed in processing noisy and heterogenous RNA-Seq data. However, AEs usually lead to ``black-box'' hidden variables difficult to interpret, hindering downstream experimental validation and clinical translation. To bridge the gap between complicated models and biological interpretations, we developed a tool, XAE4Exp (eXplainable AutoEncoder for Expression data), which integrates AE and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), a flagship technique in the field of eXplainable AI (XAI). It quantitatively evaluates the contributions of each gene to the hidden structure learned by an AE, substantially improving the expandability of AE outcomes. By applying XAE4Exp to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer gene expression data, we identified genes that are not differentially expressed, and pathways in various cancer-related classes. This tool will enable researchers and practitioners to analyze high-dimensional expression data intuitively, paving the way towards broader uses of deep learning.AvailabilityOpen source at https://github.com/QingrunZhangLab/Explainable-Deep-Autoencoder.Contactsqingrun.zhang@ucalgary.ca and wliao@ucalgary.ca.},

Data emerging from SRT are multifaceted, presenting researchers with intricate gene expression matrices, precise spatial details and comprehensive histology visuals. Such rich and intricate datasets, unfortunately, render many conventional methods like traditional machine learning and statistical models ineffective. The unique challenges posed by the specialized nature of SRT data have led the scientific community to explore more sophisticated analytical avenues. Recent trends indicate an increasing reliance on deep learning algorithms, especially in areas such as spatial clustering, identification of spatially variable genes and data alignment tasks. In this manuscript, we provide a rigorous critique of these advanced deep learning methodologies, probing into their merits, limitations and avenues for further refinement. Our in-depth analysis underscores that while the recent innovations in deep learning tailored for SRT have been promising, there remains a substantial potential for enhancement. A crucial area that demands attention is the development of models that can incorporate intricate biological nuances, such as phylogeny-aware processing or in-depth analysis of minuscule histology image segments. Furthermore, addressing challenges like the elimination of batch effects, perfecting data normalization techniques and countering the overdispersion and zero inflation patterns seen in gene expression is pivotal.

The resulting model leads to the unsupervised separation of high-level features (e.g. the standard mammography views and the nature of the breast lesions), with stochastic variation in the generated images (e.g. breast adipose tissue, calcification), enabling user-controlled global and local attribute-editing of the synthesized images.  We demonstrate the model's ability to generate anatomically and medically relevant mammograms by achieving an average AUC of 0.54 in a double-blind study on four expert mammography radiologists to distinguish between generated and real images, ascribing to the high visual quality of the synthesized and edited mammograms, and to their potential use in advancing and facilitating medical education.},

Big data has enabled us to carry out countless prediction tasks in conjunction with machine learning, such as identifying high risk patients suffering from a certain disease and taking preventable measures. However, healthcare practitioners are not content with mere predictions - they are also interested in the cause-effect relation between input features and clinical outcomes. Understanding such relations will help doctors treat patients and reduce the risk effectively. Causality is typically identified by randomized controlled trials. Often such trials are not feasible when scientists and researchers turn to observational studies and attempt to draw inferences. However, observational studies may also be affected by selection and/or confounding biases that can result in wrong causal conclusions. In this chapter, we will try to highlight some of the drawbacks that may arise in traditional machine learning and statistical approaches to analyze the observational data, particularly in the healthcare data analytics domain. We will discuss causal inference and ways to discover the cause-effect from observational studies in healthcare domain. Moreover, we will demonstrate the applications of causal inference in tackling some common machine learning issues such as missing data and model transportability. Finally, we will discuss the possibility of integrating reinforcement learning with causality as a way to counter confounding bias.},

This study aims to analyze the relationship between 30 epigenetic biomarkers and the risk of diabetes and cancer using machine learning modeling. METHODS: The data for this study were sourced from the NHANES database, which includes DNA methylation arrays and epigenetic biomarker datasets. Nine machine learning algorithms were used to build models: AdaBoost, GBM, KNN, lightGBM, MLP, RF, SVM, XGBoost, and logistics. Model stability was evaluated using metrics such as Accuracy, MCC, and Sensitivity. The performance and decision-making ability of the models were displayed using ROC curves and DCA curves, while SHAP values were used to visualize the importance of each epigenetic biomarker. RESULTS: Epigenetic age acceleration was strongly associated with cancer risk but had a weaker relationship with diabetes. In the diabetes model, the top three contributing features were logA1Mort, family income-to-poverty ratio, and marital status. In the cancer model, the top three contributing features were gender, non-Hispanic White ethnicity, and PACKYRSMort. CONCLUSION: Our study identified the relationship between epigenetic biomarkers and the risk of diabetes and cancer, and used machine learning techniques to analyze the contributions of various epigenetic biomarkers to disease risk.},

While some of these models are purely empiric, others are causal, built upon various hypotheses of AD pathophysiology, a complex and incompletely understood area of research. One of the most challenging problems in computational causal modeling is using a purely data-driven approach to derive the model's parameters and the mathematical model itself, without any prior hypothesis bias. In this paper, we develop an innovative data-driven modeling approach to build and parameterize a causal model to characterize the trajectories of AD biomarkers. This approach integrates causal model learning, population parameterization, parameter sensitivity analysis, and personalized prediction. By applying this integrated approach to a large multicenter database of AD biomarkers, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, several causal models for different AD stages are revealed. In addition, personalized models for each subject are calibrated and provide accurate predictions of future cognitive status.},

However, there are some problems in the existing research on the deduction and prediction of violation risk of listed enterprises, such as the lack of analysis of the causal logic association between violation events, the low interpretability and effectiveness of the deduction and the lack of training data. To solve these problems, we propose a framework for enterprise violation risk deduction based on generative AI and event evolution graphs. First, the generative AI technology was used to generate a new text summary of the lengthy and complex enterprise violation announcement to realize a concise overview of the violation matters. Second, by fine-tuning the generative AI model, an event entity and causality extraction framework based on automated data augmentation are proposed, and the UIE (Unified Structure Generation for Universal Information Extraction) event entity extraction model is used to create the event entity extraction for listed enterprises `violations. Then, a causality extraction model CDDP-GAT (Event Causality Extraction Based on Chinese Dictionary and Dependency Parsing of GAT) is proposed. This model aims to identify and analyse the causal links between corporate breaches, thereby deepening the understanding of the event logic. Then, the merger of similar events was realized, and the causal correlation weights between enterprise violation-related events were evaluated. Finally, the listed enterprise's violation risk event evolution graph was constructed, and the enterprise violation risk deduction was carried out to form an expert system of financial violations. The deduction results show that the method can effectively reveal signs of enterprise violations and adverse consequences.},

  abstract = {Imaging phenotypes extracted via radiomics of magnetic resonance imaging have shown great potential in predicting the treatment response in breast cancer patients after administering neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST). Understanding the causal relationships between the treatment response and Imaging phenotypes, Clinical information, and Molecular (ICM) features are critical in guiding treatment strategies and management plans. Counterfactual explanations provide an interpretable approach to generating causal inference. However, existing approaches are either computationally prohibitive for high dimensional problems, generate unrealistic counterfactuals, or confound the effects of causal features by changing multiple features simultaneously. This paper proposes a new method called Sparse CounteRGAN (SCGAN) for generating counterfactual instances to reveal causal relationships between ICM features and the treatment response after NST. The generative approach learns the distribution of the original instances and, therefore, ensures that the new instances are realistic. We propose dropout training of the discriminator to promote sparsity and introduce a diversity term in the loss function to maximize the distances among generated counterfactuals. We evaluate the proposed method on two publicly available datasets, followed by the breast cancer dataset, and compare their performance with existing methods in the literature. Results show that SCGAN generates sparse and diverse counterfactual instances that also achieve plausibility and feasibility, making it a valuable tool for understanding the causal relationships between ICM features and treatment response. Note to Practitioners--- Determining the suitability of NST for a breast cancer patient before surgery is complex and depends on factors such as patient demographics, tumor characteristics, clinical history, and molecular subtypes. Understanding the causal relationships between different features and pathologic responses to NST may lead to opportunities for targeted therapies and help oncologists make informed decisions about continuing or limiting systemic therapy after the initial consultation. The lack of causal explanations in traditional machine learning models for predicting NST has limited their applicability in clinical decision-making. SCGAN proposed in this paper overcomes the limitations of existing methods in generating causal inference via counterfactual explanations. This approach helps identify causal relationships between imaging phenotypes, clinical history, molecular features, and pathologic response to NST. The resulting information can aid in developing personalized treatment plans for patients and ultimately improve patient outcomes. The proposed approach may be extended to broader applications beyond healthcare, such as manufacturing, where it could improve quality control processes and enhance production efficiency.},

However, the substantial computational and memory requirements of LLM inference pose challenges for deployment in resource-constrained scenarios. Efforts within the field have been directed towards developing techniques aimed at enhancing the efficiency of LLM inference. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the existing literature on efficient LLM inference. We start by analyzing the primary causes of the inefficient LLM inference, i.e., the large model size, the quadratic-complexity attention operation, and the auto-regressive decoding approach. Then, we introduce a comprehensive taxonomy that organizes the current literature into data-level, model-level, and system-level optimization. Moreover, the paper includes comparative experiments on representative methods within critical sub-fields to provide quantitative insights. Last but not least, we provide some knowledge summary and discuss future research directions.},

  abstract = {In the field of artificial intelligence (AI), the quest to understand and model data-generating processes (DGPs) is of paramount importance. Deep generative models (DGMs) have proven adept in capturing complex data distributions but often fall short in generalization and interpretability. On the other hand, causality offers a structured lens to comprehend the mechanisms driving data generation and highlights the causal-effect dynamics inherent in these processes. While causality excels in interpretability and the ability to extrapolate, it grapples with intricacies of high-dimensional spaces. Recognizing the synergistic potential, we delve into the confluence of causality and DGMs. We elucidate the integration of causal principles within DGMs, investigate causal identification using DGMs, and navigate an emerging research frontier of causality in large-scale generative models, particularly generative large language models (LLMs). We offer insights into methodologies, highlight open challenges, and suggest future directions, positioning our comprehensive review as an essential guide in this swiftly emerging and evolving area.},

However, for many tasks, paired training data will not be available. We present an approach for learning to translate an image from a source domain X to a target domain Y in the absence of paired examples. Our goal is to learn a mapping G : X {$\rightarrow$} Y such that the distribution of images from G(X) is indistinguishable from the distribution Y using an adversarial loss. Because this mapping is highly under-constrained, we couple it with an inverse mapping F : Y {$\rightarrow$} X and introduce a cycle consistency loss to push F(G(X)) {$\approx$} X (and vice versa). Qualitative results are presented on several tasks where paired training data does not exist, including collection style transfer, object transfiguration, season transfer, photo enhancement, etc. Quantitative comparisons against several prior methods demonstrate the superiority of our approach.},

It overcomes several shortcoming of previous methods and provides great additional insight into the decision making process of classifiers. Making neural network decisions interpretable through visualization is important both to improve models and to accelerate the adoption of black-box classifiers in application areas such as medicine. We illustrate the method in experiments on natural images (ImageNet data), as well as medical images (MRI brain scans).},

However, current methods do not sufficiently explore the expressiveness of the multi-modal SRT data, leaving a large room for improvement of performance. Moreover, the current deep learning based methods lack interpretability due to the ``black box'' nature, impeding its further applications in the areas that require explanation.                                   Results                            We propose conST, a powerful and flexible SRT data analysis framework utilizing contrastive learning techniques. conST can learn low-dimensional embeddings by effectively integrating multi-modal SRT data,               i               .               e               . gene expression, spatial information, and morphology (if applicable).

Extensive experiments in various datasets have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed conST, achieving up to 10\% improvement in clustering ARI in the commonly used benchmark dataset. We also show that the learned embedding can be used in complicated scenarios, such as predicting cancer progression by analyzing the tumour microenvironment and cell-to-cell interaction (CCI) of breast cancer. Our framework is interpretable in that it is able to find the correlated spots that support the clustering, which matches the CCI interaction pairs as well, providing more confidence to clinicians when making clinical decisions.},

  abstract = {Counterfactual inference is a useful tool for comparing outcomes of interventions on complex systems. It requires us to represent the system in form of a structural causal model, complete with a causal diagram, probabilistic assumptions on exogenous variables, and functional assignments. Specifying such models can be extremely difficult in practice. The process requires substantial domain expertise, and does not scale easily to large systems, multiple systems, or novel system modifications. At the same time, many application domains, such as molecular biology, are rich in structured causal knowledge that is qualitative in nature. This manuscript proposes a general approach for querying a causal biological knowledge graph, and converting the qualitative result into a quantitative structural causal model that can learn from data to answer the question. We demonstrate the feasibility, accuracy and versatility of this approach using two case studies in systems biology. The first demonstrates the appropriateness of the underlying assumptions and the accuracy of the results. The second demonstrates the versatility of the approach by querying a knowledge base for the molecular determinants of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced cytokine storm, and performing counterfactual inference to estimate the causal effect of medical countermeasures for severely ill patients.},
