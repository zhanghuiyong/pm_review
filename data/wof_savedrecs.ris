AB  - Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is an emerging research topic of machine learning aimed at unboxing how AI systems' black-box choices are made. This research field inspects the measures and models involved in decision-making and seeks solutions to explain them explicitly. Many of the machine learning algorithms cannot manifest how and why a decision has been cast. This is particularly true of the most popular deep neural network approaches currently in use. Consequently, our confidence in AI systems can be hindered by the lack of explainability in these black-box models. The XAI becomes more and more crucial for deep learning powered applications, especially for medical and healthcare studies, although in general these deep neural networks can return an arresting dividend in performance. The insufficient explainability and transparency in most existing AI systems can be one of the major reasons that successful implementation and integration of AI tools into routine clinical practice are uncommon. In this study, we first surveyed the current progress of XAI and in particular its advances in healthcare applications. We then introduced our solutions for XAI leveraging multi-modal and multi-centre data fusion, and subsequently validated in two showcases following real clinical scenarios. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses can prove the efficacy of our proposed XAI solutions, from which we can envisage successful applications in a broader range of clinical questions.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) for the biomedical domain is gaining significant interest and holds considerable potential for the future of healthcare, particularly also in the context of in vitro diagnostics. The European In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Regulation (IVDR) explicitly includes software in its requirements. This poses major challenges for In Vitro Diagnostic devices (IVDs) that involve Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for data analysis and decision support. This can increase the difficulty of applying some of the most successful ML and Deep Learning (DL) methods to the biomedical domain, just by missing the required explanatory components from the manufacturers. In this context, trustworthy AI has to empower biomedical professionals to take responsibility for their decision-making, which clearly raises the need for explainable AI methods. Explainable AI, such as layerwise relevance propagation, can help in highlighting the relevant parts of inputs to, and representations in, a neural network that caused a result and visualize these relevant parts. In the same way that usability encompasses measurements for the quality of use, the concept of causability encompasses measurements for the quality of explanations produced by explainable AI methods. This paper describes both concepts and gives examples of how explainability and causability are essential in order to demonstrate scientific validity as well as analytical and clinical performance for future AI-based IVDs.

AB  - In recent years, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has attracted considerable attention from the research community, primarily focusing on elucidating the opaque decision-making processes inherent in complex black-box machine learning systems such as deep neural networks. This spike in interest originates from the widespread adoption of black-box models, particularly in critical domains like healthcare and fraud detection, highlighting the pressing need to understand and validate their decision-making mechanisms rigorously. In addition, prominent XAI techniques, including LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) and SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations), rely on heuristics and cannot guarantee the correctness of the explanations provided. This article systematically addresses this critical issue associated with machine learning and deep learning models, underscoring XAI's pivotal role in promoting model transparency to enhance decision-making quality. Furthermore, this study advocates integrating Formal Methods to provide correctness guarantees for black-box internal decision-making. The proposed methodology unfolds in three pivotal stages: firstly, training black-box models using neural networks to generate synthetic datasets; secondly, employing LIME and SHAP techniques to interpret the models and visualize their internal decision-making processes; and finally, training decision trees on the synthetic datasets to implement Formal Methods for ensuring the correctness of the black-box model's decision-making. To validate this proposed approach, experimentation was conducted on four widely recognized medical datasets, including the Wisconsin Breast Cancer and Thyroid Cancer (TC) datasets, which are available in the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Specifically, this research represents a significant contribution by pioneering a novel approach that seamlessly integrates XAI and Formal Methods, thereby furnishing correctness guarantees for internal decision-making processes within the healthcare domain.

AB  - Managing expanding urbanisation, energy use, environmental preservation, citizen economic and living standards, and people's ability to effectively use and adopt modern information and communication technology (ICT) are all objectives of smart cities. A branch of machine intelligence engineering known as explaining artificial intelligence (XAI) makes complex techniques approachable and adaptable for efficient decision-making in the sciences and technologies. The quantum uncertainty problem may be applied to the network state, which consists of several states and dimensions and requires real-time information. Specifically pertinent are the linkages between the emerging paradigms of machine learning (ML), quantum computing (QC), and quantum machine learning (QML), and traditional communication networks. This study provides a new method in explainable deep learning for analysing healthcare data in multimedia for long-term quantum photonic applications. Input has been collected from multimedia healthcare data and processed for noise removal and normalization. Processed data features have been extracted using a gradient quantum neural network, and classification is carried out using an attention-based graph neural network (GNN). The experimental analysis is carried out in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F-1 score, NSE (normalized square error), MAP (mean average precision),and Jaccard index.The proposed technique attained an accuracy of 93%, precision of 81%, recall of 79%, F-1 score of 71%, NSE of 65%, MAP of 58%, and Jaccard index of 53%.

AB  - The position and orientation of the human neck need to be measured, analyzed, and monitored during head impacts to provide preventive healthcare measures. The proposed research explores the role of explainable Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in predicting the direction of the neck by analysing the muscle forces with appropriate explanations to support any clinical system for correct decision-making. The experimental data includes mild head impacts that were replicated with median American football simulating flexion and lateral movements and was performed on ten subjects including five male and five females. OpenSim software system is used for biomechanical modeling, simulation, and analysis and to visualize the direction of the neck. Different machine learning models including a sequential neural network model were built on the labelled tendon force muscle data. The XGB classifier achieved the best performance in predicting the neck direction with an accuracy of 98 percent. The proposed research work's accuracy is promising when compared to existing works. Explainable Artificial Intelligence integration deduces the predictions of machine learning models adding meaningful interpretations to the achieved results.

AB  - The stomach is one of the main digestive organs in the GIT, essential for digestion and nutrient absorption. However, various gastrointestinal diseases, including gastritis, ulcers, and cancer, affect health and quality of life severely. The precise diagnosis of gastrointestinal (GI) tract diseases is a significant challenge in the field of healthcare, as misclassification leads to late prescriptions and negative consequences for patients. Even with the advancement in machine learning and explainable AI for medical image analysis, existing methods tend to have high false negative rates which compromise critical disease cases. This paper presents a hybrid deep learning based explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approach to improve the accuracy of gastrointestinal disorder diagnosis, including stomach diseases, from images acquired endoscopically. Swin Transformer with DCNN (EfficientNet-B3, ResNet-50) is integrated to improve both the accuracy of diagnostics and the interpretability of the model to extract robust features. Stacked machine learning classifiers with meta-loss and XAI techniques (Grad-CAM) are combined to minimize false negatives, which helps in early and accurate medical diagnoses in GI tract disease evaluation. The proposed model successfully achieved an accuracy of 93.79% with a lower misclassification rate, which is effective for gastrointestinal tract disease classification. Class-wise performance metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1-score, show considerable improvements with false-negative rates being reduced. AI-driven GI tract disease diagnosis becomes more accessible for medical professionals through Grad-CAM because it provides visual explanations about model predictions. This study makes the prospect of using a synergistic DL with XAI open for improvement towards early diagnosis with fewer human errors and also guiding doctors handling gastrointestinal diseases.

AB  - The Deep Learning (DL) models stand out as one of the most popular and widely adopted machine learning techniques across various applications, owing to their capability to handle extensive datasets and extract complex features. However, despite its widespread usage, there are concerns regarding the interpretability and explainability of the DL model, especially if the applications are related to healthcare, where trust is paramount. To address this issue, we have proposed a linguistic rule-based explainable artificial intelligence (LR-XAI) model designed to elucidate the decision-making process of DL models in terms of rules. This LR-XAI model employs various local-level interpretation methods to analyze the different features learned during training, and a linguistic rule-based system is subsequently utilized to generate rules based on these interpretation scores. The proposed model aims to enhance both interpretability in terms of feature attributions score and explainability in terms of IF-THEN rules. We evaluated the proposed model on three diverse datasets related to the physics experiments, and custom datasets. Furthermore, we conducted a statistical analysis to rigorously compare the rules generated by different interpretation models. This critical step is paramount for a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of the quality of rules. The results of these evaluations provide valuable insights into the effectiveness and applicability of our proposed model in addressing the interpretability and explainability challenges associated with DL models.

AB  - Background: Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) guides the surgeon in ensuring motor pathway integrity during high-risk neurosurgical and orthopedic procedures. Although motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) are valuablefor predicting motor outcomes, the key features of predictive signals are not well understood, and standardized warning criteria are lacking. Developing a muscle identification prediction model could increase patient safety while allowing the exploration of relevant features for the task. Objective: The aim of this study is to expand the development of machine learning (ML) methods for muscle classification and evaluate them in a bicentric setup. Further, we aim to identify key features of MEP signals that contribute to accurate muscle classification using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)techniques. Methods: This study used ML and deep learning models, specifically randomforest (RF) classifiers and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to classify MEP signals from routine supratentorial neurosurgical procedures from two medical centers according to muscle identity of four muscles (extensor digitorum, abductor pollicis brevis, tibialis anterior, and abductor hallucis). The algorithms were trained and validated on a total of 36,992 MEPs from 151 surgeries in one center, and they were tested on 24,298 MEPs from 58 surgeries from the other center. Depending on the algorithm, time-series, feature-engineered, and time-frequency representations of the MEP data were used. XAI techniques, specifically Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) values and gradient class activation maps (Grad-CAM), were implemented to identify important signal features. Results: High classification accuracy was achieved with the RF classifier, reaching 87.9% accuracy on the validation set and 80% accuracy on the test set. The 1D-and 2D-CNNs demonstrated comparably strong performance. Our XAI findings indicate that frequency components and peak latencies are crucial for accurate MEP classification, providing insights that could inform intraoperative warning criteria. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the effectiveness of ML techniques and the importance of XAI in enhancing trust in and reliability of artificial intelligence-driven IONM applications. Further, it may help to identify new intrinsic features of MEP signals so far overlooked in conventional warning criteria. By reducing the risk of muscle mislabeling and by providing the basis for possible new warning criteria, this study may help to increase patient safety during surgical procedures.

AB  - Explainability is considered essential in enabling artificial intelligence (AI) in some crucial industries, e.g., healthcare and banking. However, conventional algorithms suffer a trade-off between readability and performance, encouraging the emergence of explainable AI. In this paper, we propose a novel method to form the hierarchical Choquet integral (HCI) as an explainable AI to retain the model's accuracy and explainability. To achieve this purpose, we first adopted neuroevolution, which combines a genetic algorithm (GA) and a neural network (NN), and pruned weights to obtain information about the hierarchical decomposition of the Choquet integral. We then fine-tuned the weights of the HCI model for the classification problem. In addition, we use four datasets to illustrate the proposed algorithm and compare the results with the conventional classifiers: decision tree, deep learning, and support vector machine (SVM). The empirical results indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms others in terms of accuracy, and keeps the Choquet integral's explainable property, justifying this paper's contribution.

AB  - Since the start of the current century, artificial intelligence has gone through critical advances improving the capabilities of intelligent systems. Especially machine learning has changed remarkably and caused the rise of deep learning. Deep learning shows cutting-edge results in terms of even the most advanced, difficult problems. However, that includes a trade-off in terms of interpretability. Although traditional machine learning techniques employ interpretable working mechanisms, hybrid systems and deep learning models are black-box being beyond our understanding capabilities. So, the need for making such systems understandable, additional methods by explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has been widely developed in last years. In this sense, this study purposes a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) model, which runs a new form of Grad-CAM. As providing numerical feedback in addition to the default Grad-CAM, the numerical Grad-CAM (numGrad-CAM) was used within the developed CNN model, in order to have an explainability interface for brain tumor diagnosis. In detail, the numGrad-CAM-CNN model was evaluated via technical and physicians-oriented (human-side) evaluations. The model provided average findings of 97.11% accuracy, 95.58% sensitivity, and 96.81% specificity for the target brain tumor diagnosis setup. Additionally, numGrad-CAM integration provided 90.11% accuracy according to the other CAM variations in the same CNN model. The physicians used the numGrad-CAM-CNN model gave positive responses in terms of using the model for an explainable (and safe) diagnosis decision-making perspective for brain tumors.

AB  - Parkinson's is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, affecting nearly 8.5M people and steadily increasing. In this research, Multimodal Deep Learning is investigated for the Prodromal stage detection of Parkinson's Disease (PD), combining different 3D architectures with the novel Excitation Network (EN) and supported by Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques. Utilizing data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative, this study introduces a joint co-learning approach for multimodal fusion, enabling end-to-end training of deep neural networks and facilitating the learning of complementary information from both imaging and clinical modalities. DenseNet with EN outperformed other models, showing a substantial increase in accuracy when supplemented with clinical data. XAI methods, such as Integrated Gradients for ResNet and DenseNet, and Attention Heatmaps for Vision Transformer (ViT), revealed that DenseNet focused on brain regions believed to be critical to prodromal pathophysiology, including the right temporal and left pre-frontal areas. Similarly, ViT highlighted the lateral ventricles associated with cognitive decline, indicating their potential in the Prodromal stage. These findings underscore the potential of these regions as early-stage PD biomarkers and showcase the proposed framework's efficacy in predicting subtypes of PD and aiding in early diagnosis, paving the way for innovative diagnostic tools and precision medicine.

XAI techniques were employed to improve model transparency, offering insights into how features contribute to predictions, thereby enhancing clinician trust. Results: Rigorous data-preprocessing improved the models' generalizability and real-world applicability across diverse clinical datasets, ensuring a robust performance. Neural networks and extreme gradient boosting models achieved the best performance in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. XAI techniques demonstrated that behavioral features significantly influenced model predictions, leading to greater interpretability. Conclusions: This study successfully developed highly precise and interpretable ML models for ASD diagnosis, connecting advanced ML methods with practical clinical application and supporting the adoption of AI-driven diagnostic tools by healthcare professionals. This study's findings contribute to personalized intervention strategies and early diagnostic practices, ultimately improving outcomes and quality of life for individuals with ASD.

AB  - In the current landscape of the COVID-19 pandemic, the utilization of deep learning in medical imaging, especially in chest computed tomography (CT) scan analysis for virus detection, has become increasingly significant. Despite its potential, deep learning's "black box" nature has been a major impediment to its broader acceptance in clinical environments, where transparency in decision -making is imperative. To bridge this gap, our research integrates Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, specifically the Local Interpretable Model -Agnostic Explanations (LIME) method, with advanced deep learning models. This integration forms a sophisticated and transparent framework for COVID-19 identification, enhancing the capability of standard Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models through transfer learning and data augmentation. Our approach leverages the refined DenseNet201 architecture for superior feature extraction and employs data augmentation strategies to foster robust model generalization. The pivotal element of our methodology is the use of LIME, which demystifies the AI decision -making process, providing clinicians with clear, interpretable insights into the AI's reasoning. This unique combination of an optimized Deep Neural Network (DNN) with LIME not only elevates the precision in detecting COVID-19 cases but also equips healthcare professionals with a deeper understanding of the diagnostic process. Our method, validated on the SARS-COV-2 CT -Scan dataset, demonstrates exceptional diagnostic accuracy, with performance metrics that reinforce its potential for seamless integration into modern healthcare systems. This innovative approach marks a significant advancement in creating explainable and trustworthy AI tools for medical decisionmaking in the ongoing battle against COVID-19.

AB  - Medical healthcare has advanced substantially due to advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques for early disease detection alongside support for clinical decisions. However, a gap exists in widespread adoption of results of these algorithms by public due to black box nature of models. The undisclosed nature of these systems creates fundamental obstacles within medical sectors that handle crucial cases because medical practitioners needs to understand the reasoning behind the outcome of a particular disease. A hybrid Machine Learning (ML) framework integrating Explainable AI (XAI) strategies that will improve both predictive performance and interpretability is explored in proposed work. The system leverages Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, Random Forests and XGBoost algorithms to predict the medical condition risks of Diabetes, Anaemia, Thalassemia, Heart Disease, Thrombocytopenia within its framework. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) together with LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) adds functionality to the proposed system by displaying important features contributing to each prediction. The framework upholds an accuracy of 99.2% besides the ability to provide understandable explanations for interpretation of model outputs. The performance combined with interpretability from the framework enables clinical practitioners to make decisions through an understanding of AI-generated outputs thereby reducing distrust in AI-driven healthcare.

AB  - The COVID-19 outbreak has caused a global threat to the world healthcare system. The virus has mutated into different variants and mutations which spread more rapidly, are more deadly and have the lesser effect of vaccines. The number of cases is way more than the number of cases doctors can handle. Widely used methods of RT-PCR are tedious and time-consuming, Instant methods like antigen are very less effective and give incorrect results. Hence Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based Computer-aided Diagnosis (CAD) methods that help doctors in the correct and efficient diagnosis are the need of the hour. In this study, we propose a Deep Learning based XAI model for aiding clinical interpretation on Chest X-ray (CXR) images. The XAI diagnostic model can be integrated into NG-IoT devices using CAD models by provide accurate explainable diagnostics. We used deep-learning models with integrated Choquet integral as an aggregation function for more precise classification. Integrating it with the XAI model Grad CAM ++ increased its explainability. In our proposed work we used four different deep learning models ResNet-50, Inception V3, Densenet-121 and DCNN with integrated Choquet Integral function which increased the accuracy by 2% for Densenet-121 and DCNN and 1% for ResNet-50 and Inception V3. Using Grad CAM++ on the images increases the acceptance by medical professionals by clearly depicting how the models took the decision. We can depict that our proposed model Densenet 121 integrated with ChI outperformed all the other methods.

AB  - Humans can carry various diseases, some of which are poorly understood and lack comprehensive solutions. Such a disease can exists in human eye that can affect one or both eyes is diabetic retinopathy (DR) which can impair function, vision, and eventually result in permanent blindness. It is one of those complex complexities. Therefore, early detection of DR can significantly reduce the risk of vision impairment by appropriate treatment and necessary precautions. The primary aim of this study is to leverage cutting-edge models trained on diverse image datasets and propose a CNN model that demonstrates comparable performance. Specifically, we employ transfer learning models such as DenseNet121, Xception, Resnet50, VGG16, VGG19, and InceptionV3, and machine learning models such as SVM, and neural network models like (RNN) for binary and multi-class classification. It has been shown that the proposed approach of multi-label classification with softmax functions and categorical cross-entropy works more effectively, yielding perfect accuracy, precision, and recall values. In particular, Xception achieved an impressive 82% accuracy among all the transfer learning models, setting a new benchmark for the dataset used. However, our proposed CNN model shows superior performance, achieving an accuracy of 95.27% on this dataset, surpassing the state-of-the-art Xception model. Moreover, for single-label (binary classifications), our proposed model achieved perfect accuracy as well.

AB  - Background: Lack of trust in artificial intelligence (AI) models in medicine is still the key blockage for the use of AI in clinical decision support systems (CDSS). Although AI models are already performing excellently in systems medicine, their black -box nature entails that patient-specific decisions are incomprehensible for the physician. Explainable AI (XAI) algorithms aim to "explain"to a human domain expert, which input features influenced a specific recommendation. However, in the clinical domain, these explanations must lead to some degree of causal understanding by a clinician. Results: We developed the CLARUS platform, aiming to promote human understanding of graph neural network (GNN) predictions. CLARUS enables the visualisation of patient-specific networks, as well as, relevance values for genes and interactions, computed by XAI methods, such as GNNExplainer. This enables domain experts to gain deeper insights into the network and more importantly, the expert can interactively alter the patient-specific network based on the acquired understanding and initiate re-prediction or retraining. This interactivity allows us to ask manual counterfactual questions and analyse the effects on the GNN prediction. Conclusion: We present the first interactive XAI platform prototype, CLARUS, that allows not only the evaluation of specific human counterfactual questions based on user-defined alterations of patient networks and a re-prediction of the clinical outcome but also a retraining of the entire GNN after changing the underlying graph structures. The platform is currently hosted by the GWDG on https://rshiny.gwdg.de/apps/clarus/.

AB  - Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic disorder mainly arising from age-related factors affecting the knee joints. Its diagnosis is critically important and is usually done by medical practitioners using X-ray images. Although this process is accurate, it is time-consuming. X-ray images have facilitated the use of deep learning (DL) models for the automation of the diagnosis of knee OA, commonly employing convolutional neural network (CNN) based architectures. However, the lack of models' interpretability makes the results less trustworthy. This work builds on the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) pre-trained DL models to understand the model's behavior in classifying highly complex knee OA cases utilizing a divide-and-conquer approach - from multi-class to a binary class for better results interpretability and explainability using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Five SOTA fine-tuned DL models are tested on Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) graded X-ray images. Both multi-class and binary-class (using the multiple subsets derived from the original dataset to examine how the models perform with different data combinations) classification approaches and their interpretability of findings using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (GradCAM) are undertaken in this study. The GradCAM visualization of EfficientNetb7 demonstrates that when the degree of variance between different classes increases, the model's efficiency in classifying knee OA also increases. Specifically, it becomes more effective at distinguishing normal and severe cases with 99.13% classification accuracy. However, the model's efficacy drops to 67% for other cases, indicating that it cannot classify knee OA as effectively as doctors.

AB  - In today's increasingly interconnected digital world, cyber threats have grown in frequency and sophistication, making intrusion detection systems a critical component of modern cybersecurity frameworks. Traditional IDS methods, often based on static signatures and rule-based systems, are no longer sufficient to detect and respond to complex and evolving attacks. To address these challenges, Artificial Intelligence and machine learning have emerged as powerful tools for enhancing the accuracy, adaptability, and automation of IDS solutions. This study presents a novel, hybrid ensemble learning-based intrusion detection framework that integrates deep learning and traditional ML algorithms with explainable artificial intelligence for real-time cybersecurity applications. The proposed model combines an Artificial Neural Network and Support Vector Machine as base classifiers and employs a Random Forest as a meta-classifier to fuse predictions, improving detection performance. Recursive Feature Elimination is utilized for optimal feature selection, while SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) provide both global and local interpretability of the model's decisions. The framework is deployed using a Flask-based web interface in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud environment, capturing live network traffic and offering sub-second inference with visual alerts. Experimental evaluations using the NSL-KDD dataset demonstrate that the ensemble model outperforms individual classifiers, achieving a high accuracy of 99.40%, along with excellent precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. This research not only enhances detection capabilities but also bridges the trust gap in AI-powered security systems through transparency. The solution shows strong potential for application in critical domains such as finance, healthcare, industrial IoT, and government networks, where real-time and interpretable threat detection is vital.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) systems utilizing deep neural networks and machine learning (ML) algorithms are widely used for solving critical problems in bioinformatics, biomedical informatics and precision medicine. However, complex ML models that are often perceived as opaque and black-box methods make it difficult to understand the reasoning behind their decisions. This lack of transparency can be a challenge for both end-users and decision-makers, as well as AI developers. In sensitive areas such as healthcare, explainability and accountability are not only desirable properties but also legally required for AI systems that can have a significant impact on human lives. Fairness is another growing concern, as algorithmic decisions should not show bias or discrimination towards certain groups or individuals based on sensitive attributes. Explainable AI (XAI) aims to overcome the opaqueness of black-box models and to provide transparency in how AI systems make decisions. Interpretable ML models can explain how they make predictions and identify factors that influence their outcomes. However, the majority of the state-of-the-art interpretable ML methods are domain-agnostic and have evolved from fields such as computer vision, automated reasoning or statistics, making direct application to bioinformatics problems challenging without customization and domain adaptation. In this paper, we discuss the importance of explainability and algorithmic transparency in the context of bioinformatics. We provide an overview of model-specific and model-agnostic interpretable ML methods and tools and outline their potential limitations. We discuss how existing interpretable ML methods can be customized and fit to bioinformatics research problems. Further, through case studies in bioimaging, cancer genomics and text mining, we demonstrate how XAI methods can improve transparency and decision fairness. Our review aims at providing valuable insights and serving as a starting point for researchers wanting to enhance explainability and decision transparency while solving bioinformatics problems.

AB  - In the healthcare domain, a transformative shift is envisioned towards Healthcare 5.0. It expands the operational boundaries of Healthcare 4.0 and leverages patient-centric digital wellness. Healthcare 5.0 focuses on real-time patient monitoring, ambient control and wellness, and privacy compliance through assisted technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), Internet-of-Things (IoT), big data, and assisted networking channels. However, healthcare operational procedures, verifiability of prediction models, resilience, and lack of ethical and regulatory frameworks are potential hindrances to the realization of Healthcare 5.0. Recently, explainable AI (EXAI) has been a disruptive trend in AI that focuses on the explainability of traditional AI models by leveraging the decision-making of the models and prediction outputs. The explainability factor opens new opportunities to the black-box models and brings confidence in healthcare stakeholders to interpret the machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. EXAI is focused on improving clinical health practices and brings transparency to the predictive analysis, which is crucial in the healthcare domain. Recent surveys on EXAI in healthcare have not significantly focused on the data analysis and interpretation of models, which lowers its practical deployment opportunities. Owing to the gap, the proposed survey explicitly details the requirements of EXAI in Healthcare 5.0, the operational and data collection process. Based on the review method and presented research questions, systematically, the article unfolds a proposed architecture that presents an EXAI ensemble on the computerized tomography (CT) image classification and segmentation process. A solution taxonomy of EXAI in Healthcare 5.0 is proposed, and operational challenges are presented. A supported case study on electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring is presented that preserves the privacy of local models via federated learning (FL) and EXAI for metric validation. The case-study is supported through experimental validation. The analysis proves the efficacy of EXAI in health setups that envisions real-life model deployments in a wide range of clinical applications.

AB  - Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is of paramount importance to various domains, including healthcare, fitness, skill assessment, and personal assistants, to understand and explain the decision-making process of the artificial intelligence (AI) model. Smart homes embedded with smart devices and sensors enabled many context-aware applications to recognize physical activities. This study presents XAI-HAR, a novel XAI-empowered human activity recognition (HAR) approach based on key features identified from the data collected from sensors located at different places in a smart home. XAI-HAR identifies a set of new features (i.e., the total number of sensors used in a specific activity), as physical key features selection (PKFS) based on weighting criteria. Next, it presents statistical key features selection (SKFS) (i.e., mean, standard deviation) to handle the outliers and higher class variance. The proposed XAI-HAR is evaluated using machine learning models, namely, random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), naive Bayes (NB) and deep learning models such as deep neural network (DNN), convolution neural network (CNN), and CNN-based long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM). Experiments demonstrate the superior performance of XAI-HAR using RF classifier over all other machine learning and deep learning models. For explainability, XAI-HAR uses Local Interpretable Model Agnostic (LIME) with an RF classifier. XAI-HAR achieves 0.96% of F-score for health and dementia classification and 0.95 and 0.97% for activity recognition of dementia and healthy individuals, respectively.

AB  - Deep learning plays a vital role in classifying different arrhythmias using electrocardiography (ECG) data. Nevertheless, training deep learning models normally requires a large amount of data and can lead to privacy concerns. Unfortunately, a large amount of healthcare data cannot be easily collected from a single silo. Additionally, deep learning models are like black-box, with no explainability of the predicted results, which is often required in clinical healthcare. This limits the application of deep learning in real-world health systems.
   In this paper, to address the above-mentioned challenges, we design a novel end-to-end framework in a federated setting for ECG-based healthcare using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) and deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). The federated setting is used to solve challenges such as data availability and privacy concerns. Furthermore, the proposed framework effectively classifies different arrhythmias using an autoencoder and a classifier, both based on a CNN. Additionally, we propose an XAI-based module on top of the proposed classifier for interpretability of the classification results, which helps clinical practitioners to interpret the predictions of the classifier and to make quick and reliable decisions. The proposed framework was trained and tested using the baseline Massachusetts Institute of Technology - Boston's Beth Israel Hospital (MIT-BIH) Arrhythmia database. The trained classifier outperformed existing work by achieving accuracy up to 94.5% and 98.9% for arrhythmia detection using noisy and clean data, respectively, with five-fold cross-validation. We also propose a new communication cost reduction method to reduce the communication costs and to enhance the privacy of users' data in the federated setting. While the proposed framework was tested and validated for ECG classification, it is general enough to be extended to many other healthcare applications. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Breast cancer remains a global health problem requiring effective diagnostic methods for early detection, in order to achieve the World Health Organization's ultimate goal of breast self-examination. A literature review indicates the urgency of improving diagnostic methods and identifies thermography as a promising, cost-effective, non-invasive, adjunctive, and complementary detection method. This research explores the potential of using machine learning techniques, specifically Bayesian networks combined with convolutional neural networks, to improve possible breast cancer diagnosis at early stages. Explainable artificial intelligence aims to clarify the reasoning behind any output of artificial neural network-based models. The proposed integration adds interpretability of the diagnosis, which is particularly significant for a medical diagnosis. We constructed two diagnostic expert models: Model A and Model B. In this research, Model A, combining thermal images after the explainable artificial intelligence process together with medical records, achieved an accuracy of 84.07%, while model B, which also includes a convolutional neural network prediction, achieved an accuracy of 90.93%. These results demonstrate the potential of explainable artificial intelligence to improve possible breast cancer diagnosis, with very high accuracy.

AB  - In the rapidly evolving field of Deep Learning (DL), the trustworthiness of models is essential for their effective application in critical domains like healthcare and autonomous systems. Trustworthiness in DL encompasses aspects such as reliability, fairness, and transparency, which are crucial for its real-world impact and acceptance. However, the development of trustworthy DL models faces significant challenges. This is notably due to adversarial examples, a sophisticated form of evasion attack in adversarial machine learning (AML), which subtly alter inputs to deceive these models and pose a major threat to their safety and reliability. The current body of research primarily focuses on defensive measures, such as enhancing the robustness of models or implementing explainable AI techniques. However, this approach often neglects to address the fundamental vulnerabilities that adversaries exploit. As a result, the field tends to concentrate more on counteracting measures rather than gaining an in-depth understanding of the vulnerabilities and attack strategies inherent in DL systems. This gap in comprehensive understanding impedes the formulation of effective defense mechanisms. This research aims to shift the focus from predominantly defensive strategies toward a more extensive comprehension of adversarial techniques and the innate vulnerabilities of DL models. We undertake this by conducting a thorough systematic literature review, encompassing 49 diverse studies from the previous decade. Our findings reveal the key characteristics of adversarial examples that enable their success against image classification-based DL models. Building on these insights, we propose the Transferable Pretrained Adversarial Deep Learning framework (TPre-ADL). This conceptual model aims to rectify the deficiencies in current defense strategies by incorporating the analyzed traits of adversarial examples, potentially enhancing the robustness and trustworthiness of DL models.

AB  - The use of machine learning in healthcare has the potential to revolutionize virtually every aspect of the industry. However, the lack of transparency in AI applications may lead to the problem of trustworthiness and reliability of the information provided by these applications. Medical practitioners rely on such systems for clinical decision making, but without adequate explanations, diagnosis made by these systems cannot be completely trusted. Explainability in Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to improve our understanding of why a given output has been produced by an AI system. Automated medical report generation is one area that would benefit greatly from XAI. This survey provides an extensive literature review on XAI techniques used in medical image analysis and automated medical report generation. We present a systematic classification of XAI techniques used in this field, highlighting the most important features of each one that could be used by future research to select the most appropriate XAI technique to create understandable and reliable explanations for decisions made by AI systems. In addition to providing an overview of the state of the art in this area, we identify some of the most important issues that need to be addressed and on which research should be focused.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death globally. The unpredictability and severity of CVDs, such as sudden cardiac arrests, necessitate real-time monitoring and prediction using the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) for timely intervention. Existing AI models and IoT frameworks for CVD prediction often lack integration of diverse data and fail to provide transparency in predictions, reducing user confidence and treatment effectiveness. We propose an explainable-IoT framework leveraging eXplainable AI (XAI) in the cloud layer and a mobile application to swiftly communicate predictions and explainability to patients, healthcare providers, and other users, facilitating proactive management and informed decisions. The framework integrates sensor data with cloud-based medical records to improve cardiovascular care and build user trust. Using support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and deep neural network (DNN), we develop and evaluate CVD prediction models on two datasets: a heart disease dataset (D1) and the Cleveland dataset (D3). Additionally, we use a synthetic dataset (D2) for comparative analysis. The models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, area under the curve, time, and F1 score. For D3, SVM achieved the best accuracy (84.62%), while RF performed best on D1 and D2 (92.44% and 98.06%, respectively), comparable to state-of-the-art works. Our results highlight the importance of underrepresented physiological features in CVD datasets and the need for comprehensive datasets to enhance CVD model development. Furthermore, while synthetic data (D2) is effective for initial modeling, it requires validation with real-world data for reliable CVD prediction.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus (DM), a prevalent metabolic disorder, has significant global health implications. The advent of machine learning (ML) has revolutionized the ability to predict and manage diabetes early, offering new avenues to mitigate its impact. This systematic review examined 53 articles on ML applications for diabetes prediction, focusing on datasets, algorithms, training methods, and evaluation metrics. Various datasets, such as the Singapore National Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Program, REPLACE-BG, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), and Pima Indians Diabetes Database (PIDD), have been explored, highlighting their unique features and challenges, such as class imbalance. This review assesses the performance of various ML algorithms, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, and XGBoost, for the prediction of diabetes outcomes from multiple datasets. In addition, it explores explainable AI (XAI) methods such as Grad-CAM, SHAP, and LIME, which improve the transparency and clinical interpretability of AI models in assessing diabetes risk and detecting diabetic retinopathy. Techniques such as crossvalidation, data augmentation, and feature selection are discussed in terms of their influence on the versatility and robustness of the model. Some evaluation techniques involving k-fold cross-validation, external validation, and performance indicators such as accuracy, area under curve, sensitivity, and specificity are presented. The findings highlight the usefulness of ML in addressing the challenges of diabetes prediction, the value of sourcing different data types, the need to make models explainable, and the need to keep models clinically relevant. This study highlights significant implications for healthcare professionals, policymakers, technology developers, patients, and researchers, advocating interdisciplinary collaboration and ethical considerations when implementing ML-based diabetes prediction models. By consolidating existing knowledge, this SLR outlines future research directions aimed at improving diagnostic accuracy, patient care, and healthcare efficiency through advanced ML applications. This comprehensive review contributes to the ongoing efforts to utilize artificial intelligence technology for a better prediction of diabetes, ultimately aiming to reduce the global burden of this widespread disease.

AB  - Accurate and efficient diagnosis of skin rosacea is crucial in dermatological healthcare, yet remains challenging due to the need for precise classification and interpretability. This study aims to develop a robust and explainable approach for skin rosacea classification using advanced deep learning and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques. Our innovation lies in combining Swin Transformer models (Swin-Tiny, SwinSmall, and Swin-Base) with pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures such as VGG19, ResNet50, and DenseNet201, addressing the limitations of traditional CNN-based methods. The proposed SwinBase transformer achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 99%, outperforming all tested models across multiple evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, specificity, and others, on a dataset of 10,539 images. To enhance interpretability, we employ XAI techniques, including Score-CAM, GradCAM, and GradCAM++, which provide visual explanations and insights into the decision-making process. These findings underscore the potential of integrating cutting-edge transformer architectures with explainability techniques to build reliable, interpretable, and high-performing models for clinical dermatology, ultimately improving patient care.

AB  - The advanced development of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare has exhibited such promise hence it revolutionizes diagnostic precision, facilitates personalized treatments, and streamlines procedures. AI has progressed from primitive rule-based systems such as MYCIN to today's last generation of AI models such as GPT-4 and Med-Gemini. AI has been quite consistent in enhancing its capabilities and bringing continuing innovation in evidence-based medicine from medical-image predictive analytics to patient monitoring. Explainable AI (XAI) helps address the main problems of trust in AI because it allows transparent and understandable machine-learning predictions on which the physician can rely. Our paper investigates the potential of AI to change the delivery of care and define the cost, access, and outcome of care for different populations within the integration of human expertise and machine efficiency. Future research would need to combine innovation with ethical considerations and achieve full adoption, regarding its potential and quality operation in the healthcare sector.

KW  - BLACK-BOX
KW  - MODELS
AB  - Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) plays a crucial role in enabling human understanding and trust in deep learning systems. As models get larger, more ubiquitous, and pervasive in aspects of daily life, explainability is necessary to minimize adverse effects of model mistakes. Unfortunately, current approaches in human-centric XAI (e.g. predictive tasks in healthcare, education, or personalized ads) tend to rely on a single post-hoc explainer, whereas recent work has identified systematic disagreement between post-hoc explainers when applied to the same instances of underlying black-box models. In this viewpoint paper, we therefore present a call for action to address the limitations of current state-of-the-art explainers. We propose a shift from post-hoc explainability to designing interpretable neural network architectures. We identify five needs of human-centric XAI (real-time, accurate, actionable, human-interpretable, and consistent) and propose two possible routes forward for interpretable-by-design neural network workflows (adaptive routing and temporal diagnostics). We postulate that the future of human-centric XAI is neither in explaining black-boxes nor in reverting to traditional, interpretable models, but in neural networks that are intrinsically interpretable.

AB  - Population size has made disease monitoring a major concern in the healthcare system, due to which auto-detection has become a top priority. Intelligent disease detection frameworks enable doctors to recognize illnesses, provide stable and accurate results, and lower mortality rates. An acute and severe disease known as Coronavirus (COVID19) has suddenly become a global health crisis. The fastest way to avoid the spreading of Covid19 is to implement an automated detection approach. In this study, an explainable COVID19 detection in CT scan and chest X-ray is established using a combination of deep learning and machine learning classification algorithms. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) collects deep features from collected images, and these features are then fed into a machine learning ensemble for COVID19 assessment. To identify COVID19 disease from images, an ensemble model is developed which includes, Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Logistic Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Random Forest (RF). The overall performance of the proposed method is interpreted using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE). The proposed method is evaluated using two datasets containing 1,646 and 2,481 CT scan images gathered from COVID19 patients, respectively. Various performance comparisons with state-of-the-art approaches were also shown. The proposed approach beats existing models, with scores of 98.5% accuracy, 99% precision, and 99% recall, respectively. Further, the t-SNE and explainable Artificial Intelligence (AI) experiments are conducted to validate the proposed approach.

TI  - Enhanced survival prediction using explainable artificial intelligence in heart transplantation
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS

KW  - INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY
KW  - REGISTRY
AB  - The most limiting factor in heart transplantation is the lack of donor organs. With enhanced prediction of outcome, it may be possible to increase the life-years from the organs that become available. Applications of machine learning to tabular data, typical of clinical decision support, pose the practical question of interpretation, which has technical and potential ethical implications. In particular, there is an issue of principle about the predictability of complex data and whether this is inherent in the data or strongly dependent on the choice of machine learning model, leading to the so-called accuracy-interpretability trade-off. We model 1-year mortality in heart transplantation data with a self-explaining neural network, which is benchmarked against a deep learning model on the same development data, in an external validation study with two data sets: (1) UNOS transplants in 2017-2018 (n = 4750) for which the self-explaining and deep learning models are comparable in their AUROC 0.628 [0.602,0.654] cf. 0.635 [0.609,0.662] and (2) Scandinavian transplants during 1997-2018 (n = 2293), showing good calibration with AUROCs of 0.626 [0.588,0.665] and 0.634 [0.570, 0.698], respectively, with and without missing data (n = 982). This shows that for tabular data, predictive models can be transparent and capture important nonlinearities, retaining full predictive performance.

AB  - As 5G mobile networks are bringing about global societal benefits, the design phase for 6G has started. Evolved 5G and 6G will need sophisticated AI to automate information delivery simultaneously for mass autonomy, human machine interfacing, and targeted healthcare. Trust will become increasingly critical for 6G as it manages a wide range of mission-critical services. As we migrate from traditional mathematical model-dependent optimization to data-dependent deep learning, the insight and trust we have in our optimization modules decrease. This loss of model explainability means we are vulnerable to malicious data, poor neural network design, and the loss of trust from stakeholders and the general public -- all with a range of legal implications. In this review, we outline the core methods of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) in a wireless network setting, including public and legal motivations, definitions of explainability, performance vs. explainability trade-offs, and XAI algorithms. Our review is grounded in case studies for both wireless PHY and MAC layer optimization and provide the community with an important research area to embark upon.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a significant challenge in modern healthcare, with early detection and accurate staging remaining critical priorities for effective intervention. While Deep Learning (DL) approaches have shown promise in AD diagnosis, existing methods often struggle with the issues of precision, interpretability, and class imbalance. This study presents a novel framework that integrates DL with several eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, in particular attention mechanisms, Gradient-Weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), to improve both model interpretability and feature selection. The study evaluates four different DL architectures (ResMLP, VGG16, Xception, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with attention mechanism) on a balanced dataset of 3714 MRI brain scans from patients aged 70 and older. The proposed CNN with attention model achieved superior performance, demonstrating 99.18% accuracy on the primary dataset and 96.64% accuracy on the ADNI dataset, significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in AD classification. The ability of the framework to provide comprehensive, interpretable results through multiple visualization techniques while maintaining high classification accuracy represents a significant advancement in the computational diagnosis of AD, potentially enabling more accurate and earlier intervention in clinical settings.

AB  - This paper introduces SkinWiseNet (SWNet), a deep convolutional neural network designed for the detection and automatic classification of potentially malignant skin cancer conditions. SWNet optimizes feature extraction through multiple pathways, emphasizing network width augmentation to enhance efficiency. The proposed model addresses potential biases associated with skin conditions, particularly in individuals with darker skin tones or excessive hair, by incorporating feature fusion to assimilate insights from diverse datasets. Extensive experiments were conducted using publicly accessible datasets to evaluate SWNet's effectiveness.This study utilized four datasets-Mnist-HAM10000, ISIC2019, ISIC2020, and Melanoma Skin Cancer-comprising skin cancer images categorized into benign and malignant classes. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, specifically Grad-CAM, were employed to enhance the interpretability of the model's decisions. Comparative analysis was performed with three pre-existing deep learning networks-EfficientNet, MobileNet, and Darknet. The results demonstrate SWNet's superiority, achieving an accuracy of 99.86% and an F1 score of 99.95%, underscoring its efficacy in gradient propagation and feature capture across various levels. This research highlights the significant potential of SWNet in advancing skin cancer detection and classification, providing a robust tool for accurate and early diagnosis. The integration of feature fusion enhances accuracy and mitigates biases associated with hair and skin tones. The outcomes of this study contribute to improved patient outcomes and healthcare practices, showcasing SWNet's exceptional capabilities in skin cancer detection and classification.

AB  - Patients in intensive care unit (ICU) encounter a high risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP); a serious healthcare-associated infection. Timely and early prediction of VAP can significantly improve patient outcomes by facilitating prompt treatment. The present research introduces a powerful deep learning framework that leverages pretrained biomedical word embeddings and a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, enriched with an attention mechanism, for VAP prediction from clinical notes within the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) III dataset. Conventional machine learning models with structured data are suffering in term of accuracy and generalizability. To address these challenges, our approach combines BioWordVec embeddings-pretrained embeddings designed to capture the complex semantics in biomedical text, with a CNN model that applies variable filter sizes for comprehensive feature extraction from unstructured clinical notes, thus capturing a broad range of n-gram features. Our model's performance has been significantly enhanced by the addition of an attention mechanism, which enables it to concentrate on the most pertinent parts of the text. A hyperparameter tuning was performed to find the best set of hyperparameters for the model which leaded to significant performance in identifying VAP with a precision and recall rates of 99.26%, outperforming baseline models. To tackle our model's interpretability, we visualized the contribution of features in the prediction process based on attention weights which enables us to identify the most relevant words for VAP prediction, this improves our approach's transparency making it helpful for healthcare practitioners in medical decision-making. To assess the robustness and generalizability of our approach, we performed in inverse cross validation and closely mirrored its performance on the test set proving that the model generalizes well to unseen data. This research represents a significant advancement in the early diagnosis of VAP, extracting insightful information from unstructured clinical text and using it to generate extremely accurate binary classifications which improve patient care and lower the incidence of infections.

AB  - Prediction of local mean age of air (MAA) is a key technology that can enhance the comfort, health, and productivity of indoor residents by adjusting and optimizing the indoor environmental conditions. In this study, we developed a deep neural network (DNN)-based regression model to predict indoor air quality (IAQ) and proposed a permutation feature importance (PFI)-based explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) model to implement efficient ventilation systems in a hospital ward utilizing this regression model. The rapid prediction of the MAA in the space near each patient in the ward, depending on the location of the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) inlets and fluid velocity, were successfully measured through data-driven deep learning model training. Consequently, the proposed MAA prediction model achieved average R-squared values of 0.9506 and 0.9220 for MAA(1) and MAA(2), respectively. In addition, the DNN model demonstrated rapid predictive performance (similar to 0.4 ms/prediction), highlighting the possibility of real-time monitoring compared to conventional methods. Furthermore, the contribution of the location and fluid velocity of the HVAC system to the MAA in the space near the patient was analyzed using PFI. These results support the rapid virtual sensing and recommendation method that has the potential to be applied in future IAQ management, human healthcare, and energy management systems.

AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most prevalent cardiac arrhythmias that affects the lives of many people around the world and is associated with a five-fold increased risk of stroke and mortality. Like other problems in the healthcare domain, artificial intelligence (AI)-based models have been used to detect AF from patients' ECG signals. The cardiologist level performance in detecting this arrhythmia is often achieved by deep learning-based methods, however, they suffer from the lack of interpretability. In other words, these approaches are unable to explain the reasons behind their decisions. The lack of interpretability is a common challenge toward a wide application of machine learning (ML)-based approaches in the healthcare which limits the trust of clinicians in such methods. To address this challenge, we propose HAN-ECG, an interpretable bidirectional-recurrent-neural-network-based approach for the AF detection task. The HAN-ECG employs three attention mechanism levels to provide a multi-resolution analysis of the patterns in ECG leading to AF. The detected patterns by this hierarchical attention model facilitate the interpretation of the neural network decision process in identifying the patterns in the signal which contributed the most to the final detection. Experimental results on two AF databases demonstrate that our proposed model performs better than the existing algorithms. Visualization of these attention layers illustrates that our proposed model decides upon the important waves and heartbeats which are clinically meaningful in the detection task (e.g., absence of P-waves, and irregular R-R intervals for the AF detection task).

AB  - In recent years, machine learning, and particularly deep learning, has shown remarkable potential in various fields, including medicine. Advanced techniques like convolutional neural networks and transformers have enabled high-performance predictions for complex problems, making machine learning a valuable tool in medical decision-making. From predicting postoperative complications to assessing disease risk, machine learning has been actively used to analyze patient data and assist healthcare professionals. However, the "black box" problem, wherein the internal workings of machine learning models are opaque and difficult to interpret, poses a significant challenge in medical applications. The lack of transparency may hinder trust and acceptance by clinicians and patients, making the development of explainable AI (XAI) techniques essential. XAI aims to provide both global and local explanations for machine learning models, offering insights into how predictions are made and which factors influence these outcomes. In this article, we explore various applications of machine learning in medicine, describe commonly used algorithms, and discuss explainable AI as a promising solution to enhance the interpretability of these models. By integrating explainability into machine learning, we aim to ensure its ethical and practical application in healthcare, ultimately improving patient outcomes and supporting personalized treatment strategies.

AB  - Deep Learning (DL) holds immense potential in revolutionizing healthcare, offering robust support to clinicians and enhancing patient care. However, coming up with the right DL model is always challenging and depends on quality, quantity, and type of data. In this paper, two motor activity datasets are utilized: "Depresjon" dataset includes activity recordings from 32 healthy individuals (402 days) and 23 individuals with unipolar and bipolar depression (291 days) and the "Psykose" dataset consists of 22 schizophrenia subjects (285 days) and 32 healthy subjects (402 days). The motor activity data, represented as time-series signals, poses challenges due to variable lengths and non-uniform starting timestamps for each subject. Additionally, the daytime and nighttime distributions differ across samples, requiring explicit handling for Convolutional Neural Network models. To address this issue, a multi-branch DL architecture is employed with one branch fed with nighttime data and another with daytime data, capable of capturing features across various scales, accommodating patterns of different sizes. Moreover, the combined outputs of these branches are subjected to a self-attention-mechanism (MultiHeadAttention), which prioritizes essential features. The use of Gradient weighted Class Activation Map (GradCAM) technique aids in comprehending the model's decision-making process. The benchmark datasets were used to validate the model, which exhibited an accuracy of 0.94 for both classifying depressive and schizophrenic episodes from control subjects. An accuracy of 0.81 for classifying depressive episodes, and schizophrenics from control samples. This accuracy further increases when combining the control samples from both datasets, to 0.97 for depression and 0.98 for schizophrenia.

AB  - Breast cancer represents a significant global health challenge, which makes it essential to detect breast cancer early and accurately to improve patient prognosis and reduce mortality rates. However, traditional diagnostic processes relying on manual analysis of medical images are inherently complex and subject to variability between observers, highlighting the urgent need for robust automated breast cancer detection systems. While deep learning has demonstrated potential, many current models struggle with limited accuracy and lack of interpretability. This research introduces the Deep Neural Breast Cancer Detection (DNBCD) model, an explainable AI-based framework that utilizes deep learning methods for classifying breast cancer using histopathological and ultrasound images. The proposed model employs Densenet121 as a foundation, integrating customized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) layers including GlobalAveragePooling2D, Dense, and Dropout layers along with transfer learning to achieve both high accuracy and interpretability for breast cancer diagnosis. The proposed DNBCD model integrates several preprocessing techniques, including image normalization and resizing, and augmentation techniques to enhance the model's robustness and address class imbalances using class weight. It employs Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) to offer visual justifications for its predictions, increasing trust and transparency among healthcare providers. The model was assessed using two benchmark datasets: Breakhis-400x (B-400x) and Breast Ultrasound Images Dataset (BUSI) containing 1820 and 1578 images, respectively. We systematically divided the datasets into training (70%), testing (20%,) and validation (10%) sets, ensuring efficient model training and evaluation obtaining accuracies of 93.97% for B-400x dataset having benign and malignant classes and 89.87% for BUSI dataset having benign, malignant, and normal classes for breast cancer detection. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DNBCD model significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches with potential uses in clinical environments. We also made all the materials publicly accessible for the research community at: https://github.com/romzanalom/XAI-Based-Deep-Neural-Breast-Cancer-Detection.

AB  - Recent innovations in medical imaging have markedly improved brain tumor identification, surpassing conventional diagnostic approaches that suffer from low resolution, radiation exposure, and limited contrast. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is pivotal in precise and accurate tumor characterization owing to its high-resolution, non-invasive nature. This study investigates the synergy among multiple feature representation schemes such as local Binary Patterns (LBP), Gabor filters, Discrete Wavelet Transform, Fast Fourier Transform, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Gray-Level Run Length Matrix alongside five learning algorithms namely: k-nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), and probabilistic neural network (PNN), and CNN. Empirical findings indicate that LBP in conjunction with SVC and CNN obtained high specificity and accuracy, rendering it a promising method for MRI-based tumor diagnosis. Further to investigate the contribution of LBP, Statistical analysis chi-square and p-value tests are used to confirm the significant impact of LBP feature space for identification of brain Tumor. In addition, The SHAP analysis was used to identify the most important features in classification. In a small dataset, CNN obtained 97.8% accuracy while SVC yielded 98.06% accuracy. In subsequent analysis, a large benchmark dataset is also utilized to evaluate the performance of learning algorithms in order to investigate the generalization power of the proposed model. CNN achieves the highest accuracy of 98.9%, followed by SVC at 96.7%. These results highlight CNN's effectiveness in automated, high-precision tumor diagnosis. This achievement is ascribed with MRI-based feature extraction by combining high resolution, non-invasive imaging capabilities with the powerful analytical abilities of CNN. CNN demonstrates superiority in medical imaging owing to its ability to learn intricate spatial patterns and generalize effectively.

AB  - Background and Objective: Artificial intelligence (AI) has several uses in the healthcare industry, some of which include healthcare management, medical forecasting, practical making of decisions, and diagnosis. AI technologies have reached human-like performance, but their use is limited since they are still largely viewed as opaque black boxes. This distrust remains the primary factor for their limited real application, particularly in healthcare. As a result, there is a need for interpretable predictors that provide better predictions and also explain their predictions. Methods: This study introduces "DeepXplainer", a new interpretable hybrid deep learning-based technique for detecting lung cancer and providing explanations of the predictions. This technique is based on a convolutional neural network and XGBoost. XGBoost is used for class label prediction after "DeepXplainer" has automatically learned the features of the input using its many convolutional layers. For providing explanations or explainability of the predictions, an explainable artificial intelligence method known as "SHAP" is implemented. Results: The open-source "Survey Lung Cancer" dataset was processed using this method. On multiple parameters, including accuracy, sensitivity, F1-score, etc., the proposed method outperformed the existing methods. The proposed method obtained an accuracy of 97.43%, a sensitivity of 98.71%, and an F1-score of 98.08. After the model has made predictions with this high degree of accuracy, each prediction is explained by implementing an explainable artificial intelligence method at both the local and global levels. Conclusions: A deep learning-based classification model for lung cancer is proposed with three primary components: one for feature learning, another for classification, and a third for providing explanations for the predictions made by the proposed hybrid (ConvXGB) model. The proposed "DeepXplainer" has been evaluated using a variety of metrics, and the results demonstrate that it outperforms the current benchmarks. Providing explanations for the predictions, the proposed approach may help doctors in detecting and treating lung cancer patients more effectively.

AB  - Classifying medical images is essential in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). Although the recent success of deep learning in the classification tasks has proven advantages over the traditional feature extraction techniques, it remains challenging due to the inter and intra-class similarity caused by the diversity of imaging modalities (i.e., dermoscopy, mammography, wireless capsule endoscopy, and CT). In this work, we proposed a novel deep-learning framework for classifying several medical imaging modalities. In the training phase of the deep learning models, data augmentation is performed at the first stage on all selected datasets. After that, two novel custom deep learning architectures were introduced, called the Inverted Residual Convolutional Neural Network (IRCNN) and Self Attention CNN (SACNN). Both models are trained on the augmented datasets with manual hyperparameter selection. Each dataset's testing images are used to extract features during the testing stage. The extracted features are fused using a modified serial fusion with a strong correlation approach. An optimization algorithm- slap swarm controlled standard Error mean (SScSEM) has been employed, and the best features that passed to the shallow wide neural network (SWNN) classifier for the final classification have been selected. GradCAM, an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approach, analyzes custom models. The proposed architecture was tested on five publically available datasets of different imaging modalities and obtained improved accuracy of 98.6 (INBreast), 95.3 (KVASIR), 94.3 (ISIC2018), 95.0 (Lung Cancer), and 98.8% (Oral Cancer), respectively. A detailed comparison is conducted based on precision and accuracy, showing that the proposed architecture performs better. The implemented models are available on GitHub (https://github.com/ComputerVisionLabPMU/ScientificImagingPaper.git).

KW  - SHapley Additive exPlanation
KW  - Deep learning
AB  - Artificial intelligence has become a pivotal element in the healthcare industry, and it is used in healthcare administration, predictive modeling, decision-making, and diagnostics. Artificial intelligence technologies have achieved performance levels akin to humans in several activities; nevertheless, their widespread adoption is impeded by preconceptions of these systems as inscrutable "black boxes". In response to such requirements, the authors devised ''DiaXplain", an interpretable hybrid artificial intelligence model intended to assist in diagnosing diabetes mellitus. DiaXplain utilizes data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and integrates a convolutional neural network (CNN) for feature extraction with XGBoost for classification, guaranteeing both elevated accuracy and interpretability. This hybrid methodology allows the model to autonomously discern pertinent properties while the XGBoost element enhances its prediction efficacy. DiaXplain utilizes SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), an explainable artificial intelligence methodology that elucidates each prediction, assisting users in comprehending the reasoning behind individual and aggregate model actions. The model's performance was assessed using necessary measures, revealing that DiaXplain exceeds current approaches in accuracy, attaining an exceptional 98.24%, with a precision of 95.12% and an F1-score of 97.50. Every prediction is substantiated by SHAP-generated explanations, providing doctors with a transparent understanding of the causes influencing each diagnostic result. Unlike traditional black-box systems, DiaXplain offers local and global interpretability, making its decisions understandable and trustworthy. This dual focus on high diagnostic accuracy and explainability makes DiaXplain a novel contribution to AI-driven healthcare, bridging the critical gap between prediction power and clinical transparency.This clarity is vital for cultivating confidence among healthcare providers, facilitating more informed decision-making, and enhancing the management of diabetes mellitus. DiaXplain signifies a significant progression in artificial intelligence-driven healthcare by merging high diagnostic accuracy with interpretable forecasts, providing healthcare practitioners with a dependable tool for diabetes diagnosis that promotes precision and fosters trust via transparency.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) applications based on deep learning for diagnosing type-II diabetes are sometimes difficult to understand and communicate even as patients are eager to understand the rationale behind the diagnostic results. Accordingly, recent studies have used multiple simple rules to adequately explain the diagnostic process and results to patients. However, this can cause patient confusion as the rules vary. Hence, this study proposes a deep neural network (DNN) with random forest (RF) and modified random forest incremental interpretation (MRFII) approach for diagnosing diabetes. This method first entails constructing a DNN to predict the probability of a patient having diabetes. To make the prediction result explainable, an RF is built to explain the process and results in terms of multiple simple decision rules. Additionally, to eliminate patient confusion, the MRFII is proposed to sort and aggregate the decision rules for a specific patient. A certainty mechanism is also established to feed back the explanation results from RF to improve the effectiveness of the DNN. The proposed method was applied to a diabetes dataset from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, and the results showed that this approach provided a more concise and accurate explanation than existing explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques for the same purpose.

AB  - The COVID-19 influenza emerged and proved to be fatal, causing millions of deaths worldwide. Vaccines were eventually discovered, effectively preventing the severe symptoms caused by the disease. However, some of the population (elderly and patients with comorbidities) are still vulnerable to severe symptoms such as breathlessness and chest pain. Identifying these patients in advance is imperative to prevent a bad prognosis. Hence, machine learning and deep learning algorithms have been used for early COVID-19 severity prediction using clinical and laboratory markers. The COVID-19 data was collected from two Manipal hospitals after obtaining ethical clearance. Multiple nature-inspired feature selection algorithms are used to choose the most crucial markers. A maximum testing accuracy of 95% was achieved by the classifiers. The predictions obtained by the classifiers have been demystified using five explainable artificial intelligence techniques (XAI). According to XAI, the most important markers are c-reactive protein, basophils, lymphocytes, albumin, D-Dimer and neutrophils. The models could be deployed in various healthcare facilities to predict COVID-19 severity in advance so that appropriate treatments could be provided to mitigate a severe prognosis. The computer aided diagnostic method can also aid the healthcare professionals and ease the burden on already suffering healthcare infrastructure.

AB  - Smoking is a leading cause of various health conditions, including cancer and respiratory diseases. Smokers often face medical restrictions such as limitations in blood and organ donation, reduced effectiveness of medications, and increased surgical complications. These impacts underscore the need for early detection of smoking status to enable timely intervention. This study explores the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to predict smoking status based on health parameters, including biosignals and clinical biomarkers. A balanced subset of 2,000 instances was sampled from a publicly available Kaggle dataset comprising clinical and biometric features. Multiple ML models were implemented, including Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors, CatBoost Classifier, and an Artificial Neural Network. The Random Forest Classifier achieved the better performance with an accuracy of 0.80, precision of 0.80, recall of 0.80, and F1-score of 0.79. To enhance model interpretability, four Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques were applied: Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), QLattice, and Anchor. SHAP identified hemoglobin as the most influential predictor, while LIME, QLattice, and Anchor highlighted the role of gamma-glutamyl transferase (t). Interactions between hemoglobin, GTP, and height were associated with more accurate predictions. The integration of ensemble modeling and multiple XAI approaches offers deeper interpretability than prior studies, providing healthcare providers and policymakers with a robust, transparent decision-support tool for targeted intervention strategies.

AB  - The escalating prevalence of gastrointestinal disorders, spanning a spectrum from polyps to tumors, underscores the imperative for advanced diagnostic and interventional methodologies. This paper addresses this exigency by introducing telemedicine into the healthcare landscape, presenting an innovative approach for remote patient surgery. Telemedicine harnesses technological advancements to extend the reach of surgical expertise, transcending geographical limitations and augmenting patient-centric care strategies. Within the domain of healthcare 4.0, the integration of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (X-AI) is paramount in the telemedicine sector. This arises from the need to elucidate the decision-making processes of intricate models, particularly in the realm of gastrointestinal disease detection. We introduce TeleXGI , a sophisticated model leveraging Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures ResNet50 and MobileNetV2 with X-AI techniques for accurate gastrointestinal disease classification using the Kvasir-V2 dataset. Advanced X-AI techniques such as Grad-CAM, saliency maps, integrated gradients, attribution heatmaps, and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) are employed to enhance interpretability. These methodologies unveil the inner workings of CNNs, highlighting impacted regions and augmenting predictive transparency. Our performance assessment validates TeleXGI 's excellent diagnostic accuracy at 98.8% with ResNet50 and 98.5% with MobileNetV2, faster inference with lightweight models, and precise explanation heatmaps essential to the real-time and high-throughput data-processing requirements of Telesurgery. The credibility of the explanation heatmaps is verified against the ground truth masks of Polyps images from the Kvasir-SEG dataset. This research establishes a benchmark for pivotal healthcare applications, showcasing the potential of X-AI in enhancing the interpretability of CNN models.

AB  - Machine Learning has evolved significantly over the last decade, with models capable of robust and accurate predictions over data of various categories. The impact is rather big in the field of Healthcare. However, deployment of small, energy-efficient models remains a goal pursued by researchers across the field. Furthermore, the model inferences are hard to interpret and draw conclusions from, especially in healthcare, where its very important to know how the diagnosis decision was passed and what factors are causing the issues. In this paper, we address both of these shortcomings, where we develop a neuromorphic computing based machine learning model, namely an SNN, and using SHAP, LIME, and eli5 explainability techniques to explain the predictions of the Spiking Neural Network. The proposed SNN performs at an accuracy of 85.06%, better than the deep neural network by 5.73% for the Diabetes dataset and at an accuracy of 97.83% for the Mobile Health dataset, thereby mitigating the issue of both lack of performance-cum-efficiency, as well as uninterpretability of these machine learning models.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium. It primarily impacts the lungs but can also endanger other organs, such as the renal system, spine, and brain. When an infected individual sneezes, coughs, or speaks, the virus can spread through the air, which contributes to its high contagiousness. The goal is to enhance detection recognition with an X-ray image dataset. This paper proposed a novel approach, named the Tuberculosis Segmentation-Guided Diagnosis Model (TSSG-CNN) for Detecting Tuberculosis, using a combined semantic segmentation and adaptive convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. The proposed approach is distinguished from most of the previously proposed approaches in that it uses the combination of a deep learning segmentation model with a follow-up classification model based on CNN layers to segment chest X-ray images more precisely as well as to improve the diagnosis of TB. It contrasts with other approaches like ILCM, which is optimized for sequential learning, and explainable AI approaches, which focus on explanations. Moreover, our model is beneficial for the simplified procedure of feature optimization from the perspectives of approach using the Mayfly Algorithm (MA). Other models, including simple CNN, Batch Normalized CNN (BN-CNN), and Dense CNN (DCNN), are also evaluated on this dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The performance of the TSSG-CNN model outperformed all the models with an impressive accuracy of 98.75% and an F1 score of 98.70%.

AB  - Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has an advanced feature to enhance the decision-making feature and improve the rule-based technique by using more advanced Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) based algorithms. In this paper, we chose e-healthcare systems for efficient decision-making and data classification, especially in data security, data handling, diagnostics, laboratories, and decision-making. Federated Machine Learning (FML) is a new and advanced technology that helps to maintain privacy for Personal Health Records (PHR) and handle a large amount of medical data effectively. In this context, XAI, along with FML, increases efficiency and improves the security of e-healthcare systems. The experiments show efficient system performance by implementing a federated averaging algorithm on an open-source Federated Learning (FL) platform. The experimental evaluation demonstrates the accuracy rate by taking epochs size 5, batch size 16, and the number of clients 5, which shows a higher accuracy rate (19, 104). We conclude the paper by discussing the existing gaps and future work in an e-healthcare system.

AB  - Recent developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and their applications in critical industries such as healthcare, fin-tech and cybersecurity have led to a surge in research in explainability in AI. Innovative research methods are being explored to extract meaningful insight from blackbox AI systems to make the decision-making technology transparent and interpretable. Explainability becomes all the more critical when AI is used in decision making in domains like fintech, healthcare and safety critical systems such as cybersecurity and autonomous vehicles. However, there is still ambiguity lingering on the reliable evaluations for the users and nature of transparency in the explanations provided for the decisions made by black-boxed AI. To solve the blackbox nature of Machine Learning based Intrusion Detection Systems, a framework is proposed in this paper to give an explanation for IDSs decision making. This framework uses Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) coupled with Explain Like I'm five (ELI5) and Decision Tree algorithms to provide local and global explanations and improve the interpretation of IDSs. The local explanations provide the justification for the decision made on a specific input. Whereas, the global explanations provides the list of significant features and their relationship with attack traffic. In addition, this framework brings transparency in the field of ML driven IDS that might be highly significant for wide scale adoption of eXplainable AI in cyber-critical systems. Our framework is able to achieve 85 percent accuracy in classifying attack behaviour on UNSW-NB15 dataset, while at the same time displaying the feature significance ranking of the top 10 features used in the classification.

AB  - This research aims to enhance Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) within Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques. Specifically, we target the challenges of accurate diagnosis in medical imaging and sequential data analysis using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers and echo state cells. These models are tailored to improve diagnostic precision, particularly for conditions like rotator cuff tears in osteoporosis patients and gastrointestinal diseases. Traditional diagnostic methods and existing CDSS frameworks often fall short in managing complex, sequential medical data, struggling with long-term dependencies and data imbalances, resulting in suboptimal accuracy and delayed decisions. Our goal is to develop Artificial Intelligence (AI) models that address these shortcomings, offering robust, real-time diagnostic support. We propose a hybrid RNN model that integrates SimpleRNN, LSTM layers, and echo state cells to manage long-term dependencies effectively. Additionally, we introduce CG-Net, a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) framework for gastrointestinal disease classification, which outperforms traditional CNN models. We further enhance model performance through data augmentation and transfer learning, improving generalization and robustness against data scarcity and imbalance. Comprehensive validation, including 5-fold cross-validation and metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and Area Under the Curve (AUC), confirms the models' reliability. Moreover, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model- agnostic Explanations (LIME) are employed to improve model interpretability. Our findings show that the proposed models significantly enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, offering substantial advancements in WBANs and CDSS.

AB  - Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and globally affects both genders. The disease arises due to abnormal growth of tissue formed of malignant cells. Early detection of breast cancer is crucial for enhancing the survival rate. Therefore, artificial intelligence has revolutionized healthcare and can serve as a promising tool for early diagnosis. The present study aims to develop a machine-learning model to classify breast cancer and to provide explanations for the model results. This could improve the understanding of the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer by identifying the most important features of breast cancer tumors and the way they affect the classification task. The best-performing machine-learning model has achieved an accuracy of 97.7% using k-nearest neighbors and a precision of 98.2% based on the Wisconsin breast cancer dataset and an accuracy of 98.6% using the artificial neural network with 94.4% precision based on the Wisconsin diagnostic breast cancer dataset. Hence, this asserts the importance and effectiveness of the proposed approach. The present research explains the model behavior using model-agnostic methods, demonstrating that the bare nuclei feature in the Wisconsin breast cancer dataset and the area's worst feature Wisconsin diagnostic breast cancer dataset are the most important factors in determining breast cancer malignancy. The work provides extensive insights into the particular characteristics of the diagnosis of breast cancer and suggests possible directions for expected investigation in the future into the fundamental biological mechanisms that underlie the disease's onset. The findings underline the potential of machine learning to enhance breast cancer diagnosis and therapy planning while emphasizing the importance of interpretability and transparency in artificial intelligence-based healthcare systems.

AB  - Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a common and serious complication of diabetes, presenting as open sores or wounds on the sole. They result from impaired blood circulation and neuropathy associated with diabetes, increasing the risk of severe infections and even amputations if untreated. Early detection, effective wound care, and diabetes management are crucial to prevent and treat DFUs. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly through deep learning, has revolutionized DFU diagnosis and treatment. This work introduces the DFU_XAI framework to enhance the interpretability of deep learning models for DFU labeling and localization, ensuring clinical relevance. The framework evaluates six advanced models-Xception, DenseNet121, ResNet50, InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, and Siamese Neural Network (SNN)-using interpretability techniques like SHAP, LIME, and Grad-CAM. Among these, the SNN model excelled with 98.76% accuracy, 99.3% precision, 97.7% recall, 98.5% F1-score, and 98.6% AUC. Grad-CAM heat maps effectively identified ulcer locations, aiding clinicians with precise and visually interpretable insights. The DFU_XAI framework integrates explainability into AI-driven healthcare, enhancing trust and usability in clinical settings. This approach addresses challenges of transparency in AI for DFU management, offering reliable and efficient solutions to this critical healthcare issue. Traditional DFU methods are labor-intensive and costly, highlighting the transformative potential of AI-driven systems.

AB  - Background: We address the application of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in thyroid cytopathology, specifically for diagnosing papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), the most common type of thyroid cancer. Methods: Our research introduces deep learning frameworks that analyze cytological images from fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), a key preoperative diagnostic method for PTC. The first framework is a patch-level classifier referred as "TCS-CNN", based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, to predict thyroid cancer based on the Bethesda System (TBS) category. The second framework is an attention-based deep multiple instance learning (AD-MIL) model, which employs a feature extractor using TCS-CNN and an attention mechanism to aggregate features from smaller-patch-level regions into predictions for larger-patch-level regions, referred to as bag-level predictions in this context. Results: The proposed TCS-CNN framework achieves an accuracy of 97% and a recall of 96% for small-patch-level classification, accurately capturing local malignancy information. Additionally, the AD-MIL framework also achieves approximately 96% accuracy and recall, demonstrating that this framework can maintain comparable performance while expanding the diagnostic coverage to larger regions through patch aggregation. Conclusions: This study provides a feasibility analysis for thyroid cytopathology classification and visual interpretability for AI diagnosis, suggesting potential improvements in patient outcomes and reductions in healthcare costs.

It introduces an UnBias approach for assessing bias in different deep neural network architectures and detects instances where bias seeps into the learning process, shifting the model's focus away from the main features. This contributes to the advancement of equitable and trustworthy AI applications in diverse social settings, especially in healthcare. A case study on COVID-19 detection is carried out, involving chest X-ray scan datasets from various publicly accessible repositories and five well-represented and underrepresented gender-based models across four deep-learning architectures: ResNet50V2, DenseNet121, InceptionV3, and Xception.

AB  - Objective: In chronic kidney disease (CKD), critical health indicators such as Platelet count, Prothrombin Time (PT), and depression play pivotal roles in patient management and outcome prediction. Platelets and PT are essential in assessing the coagulation status, which can be compromised in CKD, while depression significantly impacts the quality of life and treatment adherence. This study employs machine learning (ML) techniques to unravel the complexities of variable interactions in CKD and their collective influence on Platelet counts and PT levels. Specifically, we aim to leverage the capabilities of neural networks to dissect and understand how various patient characteristics-including biological sex, age, and pre-existing medical conditions-affect these crucial blood parameters. By doing so, we seek to provide clinically actionable insights that could support personalized monitoring and more effective risk stratification in CKD management. Data source and setting: The data for this study were derived from an open-source dataset, originally utilized in the study by Li et al. and also published on Kaggle, an open data platform. Methods: Data were sourced from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) Database, comprising a cohort of 1177 patients for the analysis. The dataset was randomly split into a training set and a validation set. We utilized a sequential neural network (NN) model trained using backpropagation to predict the levels of platelet count, PT, and depression indicators. Performance of the model was evaluated on the validation set, focusing on loss reduction over training iterations and accuracy improvement. Additionally, quantitative metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) were used to assess prediction accuracy. Results: The NN model was trained to predict platelet count and PT levels, which are critical indicators in patients with chronic kidney disease. The model achieved an accuracy of 65.01 % for platelet count prediction (MSE = 0.0098) and 75.85 % for PT prediction (MSE = 0.0091), with the training loss rapidly decreasing to a plateau-indicating stable convergence. For platelet count, regression analysis identified blood acidity (pH) ((3 = 0.180, p < 0.001) and age ((3 =-0.162, p < 0.001) as the most significant predictors. In contrast, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP)-based feature importance analysis ranked pH and gender as the most impactful features, followed by hyperlipemia and age, highlighting the non-linear interactions captured by the neural network. Similarly, PT prediction was significantly influenced by hyperlipemia ((3 = 1.4162, p < 0.05) and hypertensive status ((3 =-1.5667, p < 0.05) in the regression model, and these two variables were also identified by SHAP as the most influential contributors. These findings underscore the complementary strengths of traditional statistical methods and explainable artificial intelligence (AI) techniques like SHAP in capturing both direct effects and complex, non-linear relationships, ultimately improving model interpretability and clinical applicability in predictive healthcare analytics. Conclusions: The Backpropagation NN model utilized in this study represents a robust approach for analyzing and predicting key coagulation indicators in CKD patients. By identifying the most influential clinical variables driving platelet count and PT variation, this framework offers practical value in enhancing patient-specific risk assessment, monitoring strategies, and individualized treatment planning.
   Despite limitations related to dataset size, the model provides a foundation for clinically meaningful decision-support tools in nephrology.

AB  - The opioid crisis has disproportionately affected U.S. veterans, leading the Veterans Health Administration to implement opioid prescribing guidelines. Veterans who receive care from both VA and non-VA providers-known as dual-system users-have an increased risk of Opioid Use Disorder (OUD). The interaction between dual-system use and demographic and clinical factors, however, has not been previously explored. We conducted a retrospective study of 856,299 patient instances from the Washington DC and Baltimore VA Medical Centers (2012-2019), using a deep neural network (DNN) and explainable Artificial Intelligence to examine the impact of dual-system use on OUD and how demographic and clinical factors interact with it. Of the cohort, 146,688(17%) had OUD, determined through Natural Language Processing of clinical notes and ICD-9/10 diagnoses. The DNN model, with a 78% area under the curve, confirmed that dual-system use is a risk factor for OUD, along with prior opioid use or other substance use. Interestingly, a history of other drug use interacted negatively with dual-system use regarding OUD risk. In contrast, older age was associated with a lower risk of OUD but interacted positively with dual-system use. These findings suggest that within the dual-system users, patients with certain risk profiles warrant special attention.

AB  - Accurate classification of respiratory abnormality levels is crucial for early detection and diagnosis of respiratory diseases, making it a pivotal area in the field of medical diagnostics. This study proposes a novel artificial intelligence approach for accurate classification of respiratory abnormality levels. By transforming respiratory sound time-series data into image representations using recurrent plot, Markov transition field, and Gramian angular field, we capture intricate temporal patterns and spatial relationships. A deep neural network autonomously extracts discriminative features from these representations, subsequently integrated into machine learning classifiers. Leveraging the International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics (ICBHI) database, our methodology achieves remarkable classification accuracy of 100% for both binary and four- class scenarios, accurately distinguishing normal from abnormal sounds, and discriminating between crackles, wheezes, and their combinations. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method enhances interpretability, providing insights into feature importance and decision-making processes. This interpretable and high- performing approach offers significant promise for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of respiratory disorder diagnosis and treatment planning in clinical settings, potentially improving patient outcomes and healthcare efficiency.

AB  - Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems can help radiologists in numerous medical tasks including classification and staging of the various diseases. The 3D tomosynthesis imaging technique adds value to the CAD systems in diagnosis and classification of the breast lesions. Several convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures have been proposed to classify the lesion shapes to the respective classes using a similar imaging method. However, not only is the black box nature of these CNN models questionable in the healthcare domain, but so is the morphological-based cancer classification, concerning the clinicians. As a result, this study proposes both a mathematically and visually explainable deep-learning-driven multiclass shape-based classification framework for the tomosynthesis breast lesion images. In this study, authors exploit eight pretrained CNN architectures for the classification task on the previously extracted regions of interests images containing the lesions. Additionally, the study also unleashes the black box nature of the deep learning models using two well-known perceptive explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) algorithms including Grad-CAM and LIME. Moreover, two mathematical-structure-based interpretability techniques, i.e., t-SNE and UMAP, are employed to investigate the pretrained models' behavior towards multiclass feature clustering. The experimental results of the classification task validate the applicability of the proposed framework by yielding the mean area under the curve of 98.2%. The explanability study validates the applicability of all employed methods, mainly emphasizing the pros and cons of both Grad-CAM and LIME methods that can provide useful insights towards explainable CAD systems.

AB  - Deep learning is the fastest growing field in artificial intelligence and has led to many transformative innovations in various domains. However, lack of interpretability sometimes hinders its application in hypothesis-driven domains such as biology and healthcare. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning model with individual feature ranking. Several simulated datasets with the scenarios that contributing features are correlated and buried among non-contributing features were used to characterize the novel analysis approach. A publicly available clinical dataset was also applied. The performance of the individual level dropout feature ranking model was compared with commonly used artificial neural network model, random forest model, and population level dropout feature ranking model. The individual level dropout feature ranking model provides a reasonable prediction of the outcomes. Unlike the random forest model and population level dropout feature ranking model, which can only identify global-wise contributing features (i.e., at population level), the individual level dropout feature ranking model allows further identification of impactful features on response at individual level. Therefore, it provides a basis for clustering patients into subgroups. This may provide a new tool for enriching patients in clinical drug development and developing personalized or individualized medicine.

AB  - The early and accurate detection of skin cancer can reduce mortality rates and improve patient outcomes, but requires advanced diagnostics. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into healthcare enables the precise and timely detection of skin cancer. However, significant challenges remain including the difficulty in differentiating visually similar skin conditions and the limitations of diverse, representative datasets. In this study, we proposed DCAN-Net, a novel deep-learning framework designed for the early detection of skin cancer. The model leverages an efficient backbone architecture optimized for capturing diverse skin patterns, utilizing carefully tuned parameters to enhance the discrimination capabilities and refine the extracted features using modified attention modules, thereby prioritizing relevant foreground information while minimizing background noise. Furthermore, the Grad-CAM explainable AI method was employed, highlighting the most salient features within dermatoscopic images. The fused optimal feature representations significantly enhanced the dermatoscopic image analysis. When evaluated on the HAM10000 dataset, DCAN-Net achieved a precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy of 97.00%, 97.57%, 97.10%, and 97.57%, respectively. Moreover, the application of advanced data augmentation techniques mitigated data imbalance issues and reduced false-positive and false-negative rates across the original and augmented datasets. These findings demonstrate the potential of DCAN-Net for improving clinical outcomes and advancing AI-driven skin cancer diagnostics.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder globally, afflicting approximately 10 million individuals, necessitates early detection for optimal management. In this paper, we propose deep learning models to discern Parkinson's disease through the nuanced analysis of handwriting with the overall objective of achieving transparency and trustworthiness through the integration of Explainable and Interpretable AI.Leveraging transfer learning from well-established VGG16 and VGG19 architectures and introducing two bespoke CNN models (PD-Detect1 and PD-Detect2), we meticulously scrutinize diverse datasets (HandPD, NewhandPD, Parkinson Drawing) to ascertain the efficacy of our approach. LIME and SHAP Explainable AI techniques are employed to pinpoint specific regions of the spiral drawings that significantly influence the predictions made by the VGG16 and PD-Detect2 models. Additionally, Convolutional Filter Visualization and Grad-CAM are utilized to illustrate how the convolutional layers of the PD-Detect2 model function. Finally, LIME is applied to the PD-Detect2 model to identify visual markers of handwriting symptoms in the spiral drawing.Remarkable results underscore our reliance on VGG16 and VGG19 for precise identification, achieving an outstanding 100% accuracy in the waves drawing dataset. PD-Detect1 exhibits commendable performance with an accuracy of 94.44% in the meander of NewhandPD dataset, while VGG16 achieves an accuracy of 95%. VGG16 records 95% accuracy while PD-Detect2 achieves 85% accuracy in the spiral drawing dataset. Both results further bolstered to 100% with the application of classic data augmentation techniques. The Positive/Negative superpixels from LIME and SHAP highlight the key regions used by VGG16 and PD-Detect2 for predictions, while PD-Detect2 places more emphasis on disease-related features. Visualizing convolutional filters provided insight into the functionality of each layer within the PD-Detect2 model, while the Class Activation Maps produced by Grad-CAM highlighted the image regions most influential to the model's decision. Ultimately, LIME's superpixels identified visual markers of handwriting symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease.Explainable AI and Interpretable AI enhance the quality of CNN models and support the decision-making process, enabling healthcare professionals to more accurately assess disease probability and monitor treatment responses. This leads to a more effective system for the early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease through prediction and visual monitoring of handwriting symptoms.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Bones are essential components of the human body, providing structural support, enabling mobility, storing minerals, and protecting internal organs. Bone fractures (BFs) are common injuries that result from excessive physical force and can lead to serious complications, including bleeding, infection, impaired oxygenation, and long-term disability. Early and accurate identification of fractures through radiographic imaging is critical for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. However, manual evaluation of X-rays is often time-consuming and prone to diagnostic errors due to human limitations. To address this, artificial intelligence (AI), particularly deep learning (DL), has emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing diagnostic precision in medical imaging. Methods: This research introduces a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) model, the Multi-Level Feature Fusion Network (MLFNet), designed to capture and integrate both low-level and high-level image features. The model was evaluated using the Bone Fracture Multi-Region X-ray (BFMRX) dataset. Preprocessing steps included image normalization, resizing, and contrast enhancement to ensure stable convergence, reduce sensitivity to lighting variations in radiographic images, and maintain consistency. Ablation studies were conducted to assess architectural variations, confirming the model's robustness and generalizability across data distributions. MLFNet's high accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency make it a promising solution for clinical deployment. Results: MLFNet achieved an impressive accuracy of 99.60% as a standalone model and 98.81% when integrated into hybrid ensemble architectures with five leading pre-trained DL models. Conclusions: The proposed approach supports timely and precise fracture detection, optimizing the diagnostic process and reducing healthcare costs. This approach offers significant potential to aid clinicians in fields such as orthopedics and radiology, contributing to more equitable and effective patient care.

AB  - Artificial intelligence has the potential to revolutionize disease diagnosis, classification, and identification. However, the implementation of clinical-decision support algorithms for medical imaging faces challenges with reliability and interpretability. This study presents a diagnostic tool based on a deep-learning framework for four-class classification of ocular diseases by automatically detecting diabetic macular edema, drusen, choroidal neovascularization, and normal images in optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans of the human eye. The proposed framework utilizes OCT images of the retina and analyses using three different convolution neural network (CNN) models (five, seven, and nine layers) to identify the various retinal layers extracting useful information, observe any new deviations, and predict the multiple eye deformities. The framework utilizes OCT images of the retina, which are preprocessed and processed for noise removal, contrast enhancements, contour-based edge, and detection of retinal layer extraction. This image dataset is analyzed using three different CNN models (of five, seven, and nine layers) to identify the four ocular pathologies. Results obtained from the experimental testing confirm that our model has excellently performed with 0.965 classification accuracy, 0.960 sensitivity, and 0.986 specificities compared with the manual ophthalmological diagnosis.

AB  - The adoption of deep learning in healthcare is hindered by their "black box" nature. In this paper, we explore the RETAIN architecture for the task of glucose forecasting for diabetic people. By using a two-level attention mechanism, the recurrent-neural-network-based RETAIN model is interpretable. We evaluate the RETAIN model on the type-2 IDIAB and the type-1 OhioT1DM datasets by comparing its statistical and clinical performances against two deep models and three models based on decision trees. We show that the RETAIN model offers a very good compromise between accuracy and interpretability, being almost as accurate as the LSTM and FCN models while remaining interpretable. We show the usefulness of its interpretable nature by analyzing the contribution of each variable to the final prediction. It revealed that signal values older than 1h are not used by the RETAIN model for 30min ahead of time prediction of glucose. Also, we show how the RETAIN model changes its behavior upon the arrival of an event such as carbohydrate intakes or insulin infusions. In particular, it showed that the patient's state before the event is particularly important for the prediction. Overall the RETAIN model, thanks to its interpretability, seems to be a very promising model for regression or classification tasks in healthcare.

AB  - Integrating machine learning (ML) into healthcare has rapidly advanced, necessitating precise and reliable explanatory mechanisms, especially in critical areas such as glaucoma detection and analysis. This systematic review examines how Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) enhances the transparency and comprehensibility of machine learning algorithms for glaucoma detection. By emphasizing XAI, the review aims to demonstrate its critical importance in a field where accuracy and trust are essential. To evaluate the effectiveness of XAI in conjunction with ML, this review meticulously assesses various XAI methodologies for their ability to clarify the intricate workings of ML models. The analysis is grounded in examining well-known medical imaging datasets geared towards glaucoma detection, providing a focused overview of XAI's role in interpreting complex ML decisions in a healthcare context. Findings from the review indicate that applying XAI techniques has significantly improved clinician trust in ML-driven decisions by making the decision-making processes more transparent and comprehensible. This enhancement in trust is attributed to XAI's ability to provide deeper insights into the logic and reasoning behind ML algorithms, thereby facilitating a better understanding of their outcomes. Although the application of XAI in glaucoma detection and analysis has shown promising improvements in clinician trust and the transparency of ML models, there remains a critical need for more comprehensive research. Such studies would aim to fully ascertain the long-term impacts of XAI-enhanced ML on healthcare outcomes, particularly in glaucoma analysis, where the stakes for accurate and understandable diagnostic tools are incredibly high.

AB  - Skin cancer, a prevalent and potentially life-threatening condition, demands accurate and timely detection for effective intervention. It is an uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in the human body. Studies are underway to determine if a skin lesion is benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous), but the biggest challenge for a doctor is determining the type of skin cancer. As a result, determining the type of tumour is crucial for the right course of treatment. In this study, we introduce a groundbreaking approach to multi-class skin cancer detection by harnessing the power of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) in conjunction with a customised You Only Look Once (YOLOv7) architecture. Our research focuses on enhancing the YOLOv7 framework to accurately discern 8 different skin cancer classes, including melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma. The YOLOv7 model is the robust backbone, enriched with features tailored for precise multi-class classification. Concurrently, integrating XAI elements, Local Interpretable Modal-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) ensures transparent decision-making processes, enabling healthcare professionals to interpret and trust the model's predictions. This innovative synergy between YOLOv7 and XAI heralds a new era in interpretability, resulting in high-performance skin cancer diagnostics. The obtained results are 96.8%, 94.2%, 95.6%, and 95.8%, evaluated with popular quantitative metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, respectively.

AB  - Background and purpose - Artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning (DL), and machine learning (ML) have become common research fields in orthopedics and medicine in general. Engineers perform much of the work. While they gear the results towards healthcare professionals, the difference in competencies and goals creates challenges for collaboration and knowledge exchange. We aim to provide clinicians with a context and understanding of AI research by facilitating communication between creators, researchers, clinicians, and readers of medical AI and ML research. Methods and results - We present the common tasks, considerations, and pitfalls (both methodological and ethical) that clinicians will encounter in AI research. We discuss the following topics: labeling, missing data, training, testing, and overfitting. Common performance and outcome measures for various AI and ML tasks are presented, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, Dice score, the area under the curve, and ROC curves. We also discuss ethical considerations in terms of privacy, fairness, autonomy, safety, responsibility, and liability regarding data collecting or sharing. Interpretation - We have developed guidelines for reporting medical AI research to clinicians in the run-up to a broader consensus process. The proposed guidelines consist of a Clinical Artificial Intelligence Research (CAIR) checklist and specific performance metrics guidelines to present and evaluate research using AI components. Researchers, engineers, clinicians, and other stakeholders can use these proposal guidelines and the CAIR checklist to read, present, and evaluate AI research geared towards a healthcare setting.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of individuals worldwide, causing severe cognitive decline and memory impairment. The early and accurate diagnosis of AD is crucial for effective intervention and disease management. In recent years, deep learning techniques have shown promising results in medical image analysis, including AD diagnosis from neuroimaging data. However, the lack of interpretability in deep learning models hinders their adoption in clinical settings, where explainability is essential for gaining trust and acceptance from healthcare professionals. In this study, we propose an explainable AI (XAI)-based approach for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, leveraging the power of deep transfer learning and ensemble modeling. The proposed framework aims to enhance the interpretability of deep learning models by incorporating XAI techniques, allowing clinicians to understand the decision-making process and providing valuable insights into disease diagnosis. By leveraging popular pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as VGG16, VGG19, DenseNet169, and DenseNet201, we conducted extensive experiments to evaluate their individual performances on a comprehensive dataset. The proposed ensembles, Ensemble-1 (VGG16 and VGG19) and Ensemble-2 (DenseNet169 and DenseNet201), demonstrated superior accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores compared to individual models, reaching up to 95%. In order to enhance interpretability and transparency in Alzheimer's diagnosis, we introduced a novel model achieving an impressive accuracy of 96%. This model incorporates explainable AI techniques, including saliency maps and grad-CAM (gradient-weighted class activation mapping). The integration of these techniques not only contributes to the model's exceptional accuracy but also provides clinicians and researchers with visual insights into the neural regions influencing the diagnosis. Our findings showcase the potential of combining deep transfer learning with explainable AI in the realm of Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, paving the way for more interpretable and clinically relevant AI models in healthcare.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of vision complications and partially sighted which pose considerable diagnostic difficulties because of its diverse and varying symptoms. Some of them include the fact that the disease displays a non-uniform pattern, where patients present different symptoms; the requirement of highly qualified specialists to interpret the images of the fundus; the risk of errors in the interpretation of images or their inconsistency; and the absence of clear morphological signs often makes early diagnosis unlikely. Traditional diagnosis mostly rely on the expert interpretation of retinal images, which can lead to bias and inaccuracy; highlighting the need for improved diagnostic methods. Although traditional Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods enhance the diagnostic capabilities remarkably, their black box nature and information opacity restrict healthcare providers to comprehend the reasoning framework of the AI to build trust and optimize its usage in practice. Explainable AI (XAI) is an emerging approach that addresses the black-box problem by improving the interpretability of models, which allows users to understand the logic behind certain decisions. This research proposed a diagnosis model for detecting diabetic retinopathy using XAI approaches that increases the interpretability of the models to help clinicians understand the reasons behind the decisions. The proposed model is used to enhance diagnostic accuracy, offer comprehensible, and concise insights regarding the diagnostics. The convergence history plots of the proposed model validate the learning process to achieve 94% better diagnostic accuracy than traditional methods while improving interpretability and applicability in healthcare settings, indicating improvement in accuracy and loss reduction.

TI  - Development of an ensemble CNN model with explainable AI for the classification of gastrointestinal cancer
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - The implementation of AI assisted cancer detection systems in clinical environments has faced numerous hurdles, mainly because of the restricted explainability of their elemental mechanisms, even though such detection systems have proven to be highly effective. Medical practitioners are skeptical about adopting AI assisted diagnoses as due to the latter's inability to be transparent about decision making processes. In this respect, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has emerged to provide explanations for model predictions, thereby overcoming the computational black box problem associated with AI systems. In this particular research, the focal point has been the exploration of the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) approaches which enable model prediction explanations. This study used an ensemble model consisting of three convolutional neural networks(CNN): InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2 and VGG16, which was based on averaging techniques and by combining their respective predictions. These models were trained on the Kvasir dataset, which consists of pathological findings related to gastrointestinal cancer. An accuracy of 96.89% and F1-scores of 96.877% were attained by our ensemble model. Following the training of the ensemble model, we employed SHAP and LIME to analyze images from the three classes, aiming to provide explanations regarding the deterministic features influencing the model's predictions. The results obtained from this analysis demonstrated a positive and encouraging advancement in the exploration of XAI approaches, specifically in the context of gastrointestinal cancer detection within the healthcare domain.

The models-K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost-were evaluated using a well-structured pipeline that included data cleaning, preprocessing, training, and testing stages. Performance metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, sensitivity, and specificity were applied for robust evaluation. Unlike many previous studies, this research integrates XAI methods like SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) to enhance the interpretability of the best-performing model. These techniques identified critical features contributing to the model's decisions, enabling better insights into the decision-making process. Additionally, the findings were validated through expert opinions to ensure real-world applicability. The results demonstrated significant improvements, with XGBoost achieving an accuracy rate of 98.91%, outperforming the KNN (81.18%), SVM (75.38%), Naive Bayes (75.49%), ANN (74.83%), Decision Trees (76.91%), and Random Forest (91.68%) models. This study highlights the potential of integrating machine learning with XAI techniques for transparent and effective diabetes diagnosis.

AB  - In healthcare, medical practitioners employ various imaging techniques such as CT, X-ray, PET, and MRI to diagnose patients, emphasizing the crucial need for early disease detection to enhance survival rates. Medical Image Analysis (MIA) has undergone a transformative shift with the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques such as Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), promising advanced diagnostics and improved healthcare outcomes. Despite these advancements, a comprehensive understanding of the efficiency metrics, computational complexities, interpretability, and scalability of AI based approaches in MIA is essential for practical feasibility in real-world healthcare environments. Existing studies exploring AI applications in MIA lack a consolidated review covering the major MIA stages and specifically focused on evaluating the efficiency of AI based approaches. The absence of a structured framework limits decision-making for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers in selecting and implementing optimal AI approaches in healthcare. Furthermore, the lack of standardized evaluation metrics complicates methodology comparison, hindering the development of efficient approaches. This article addresses these challenges through a comprehensive review, taxonomy, and analysis of existing AI-based MIA approaches in healthcare. The taxonomy covers major image processing stages, classifying AI approaches for each stage based on method and further analyzing them based on image origin, objective, method, dataset, and evaluation metrics to reveal their strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, comparative analysis conducted to evaluate the efficiency of AI based MIA approaches over five publically available datasets: ISIC 2018, CVC-Clinic, 2018 DSB, DRIVE, and EM in terms of accuracy, precision, Recall, F-measure, mIoU, and specificity. The popular public datasets and evaluation metrics are briefly described and analyzed. The resulting taxonomy provides a structured framework for understanding the AI landscape in healthcare, facilitating evidence-based decision-making and guiding future research efforts toward the development of efficient and scalable AI approaches to meet current healthcare needs.

AB  - The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is critical indigestion and nutrient absorption, thus vital for human health. However, it is prone to diseases like cancer. Manual assessments introduce accuracy variations, consistency issues, and delays. Resources like the GastroVision dataset were introduced to advance AI in this field. Yet, it faces class imbalance issues, and baseline evaluation lacks novel methodologies, impacting accuracy. We propose a novel deep-learning model to enhance accuracy and robustness. Our approach involves averaging weights of multiple models fine-tuned with diverse hyper-parameters. In contrast to classical ensembles, our approach uses DenseNet-121 as a baseline and enables the averaging of numerous models without incurring extra inference or memory costs. Data augmentation techniques are incorporated to address class imbalance. We achieve promising results on standard performance metrics, substantially improving over baseline, notably 2.4% points in Macro Precision. Additionally, we integrate explainable AI (XAI) techniques to enhance reliability and interpretability, shedding light on the model's decision-making processes. Our study contributes to robust methodologies for imbalanced datasets, promoting model transparency and trust in predictive outcomes for clinical decision support systems.

AB  - Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is essential for enabling clinical users to get informed decision support from AI and comply with evidence-based medical practice. Applying XAI in clinical settings requires proper evaluation criteria to ensure the explanation technique is both technically sound and clinically useful, but specific support is lacking to achieve this goal. To bridge the research gap, we propose the Clinical XAI Guidelines that consist of five criteria a clinical XAI needs to be optimized for. The guidelines recommend choosing an explanation form based on Guideline 1 (G1) Understandability and G2 Clinical relevance. For the chosen explanation form, its specific XAI technique should be optimized for G3 Truthfulness, G4 Informative plausibility, and G5 Computational efficiency. Following the guidelines, we conducted a systematic evaluation on a novel problem of multi-modal medical image explanation with two clinical tasks, and proposed new evaluation metrics accordingly. Sixteen commonly-used heatmap XAI techniques were evaluated and found to be insufficient for clinical use due to their failure in G3 and G4. Our evaluation demonstrated the use of Clinical XAI Guidelines to support the design and evaluation of clinically viable XAI.

AB  - Chronic renal disease (CRD) is a significant concern in the field of healthcare, highlighting the crucial need of early and accurate prediction in order to provide prompt treatments and enhance patient outcomes. This article presents an end-to- end predictive model for the binary classification of CRD in healthcare, addressing the crucial need for early and accurate predictions to enhance patient outcomes. Through hyperparameter optimization using GridSearchCV, we significantly improve model performance. Leveraging a range of machine learning (ML) techniques, our approach achieves a high predictive accuracy of 99.07% for random forest, extra trees classifier, logistic regression with L2 penalty, and artificial neural networks (ANN). Through rigorous evaluation, the logistic regression with L2 penalty emerges as the top performer, demonstrating consistent performance. Moreover, integration of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, such as Local Interpretable Model- agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), enhances interpretability and reveals insights into model decision-making. By emphasizing an end-to-end model development process, from data collection to deployment, our system enables real-time predictions and informed healthcare decisions. This comprehensive approach underscores the potential of predictive modeling in healthcare to optimize clinical decision-making and improve patient care outcomes.

AB  - With the power of parallel processing, large datasets, and fast computational resources, deep neural networks (DNNs) have outperformed highly trained and experienced human experts in medical applications. However, the large global community of healthcare professionals, many of whom routinely face potentially life-or-death outcomes with complex medicolegal consequences, have yet to embrace this powerful technology. The major problem is that most current AI solutions function as a metaphorical black-box positioned between input data and output decisions without a rigorous explanation for their internal processes. With the goal of enhancing trust and improving acceptance of artificial intelligence- (AI) based technology in clinical medicine, there is a large and growing effort to address this challenge using eXplainable AI (XAI), a set of techniques, strategies, and algorithms with an explicit focus on explaining the "hows and whys" of DNNs. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art XAI techniques concerning healthcare applications and discuss current challenges and future directions. We emphasize the strengths and limitations of each category, including image, tabular, and textual explanations, and explore a range of evaluation metrics for assessing the effectiveness of XAI solutions. Finally, we highlight promising opportunities for XAI research to enhance the acceptance of DNNs by the healthcare community.

AB  - Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has received great interest in the recent decade, due to its importance in critical application domains, such as self-driving cars, law, and healthcare. Genetic programming (GP) is a powerful evolutionary algorithm for machine learning. Compared with other standard machine learning models such as neural networks, the models evolved by GP tend to be more interpretable due to their model structure with symbolic components. However, interpretability has not been explicitly considered in GP until recently, following the surge in the popularity of XAI. This article provides a comprehensive review of the studies on GP that can potentially improve the model interpretability, both explicitly and implicitly, as a byproduct. We group the existing studies related to explainable artificial intelligence by GP into two categories. The first category considers the intrinsic interpretability, aiming to directly evolve more interpretable (and effective) models by GP. The second category focuses on post-hoc interpretability, which uses GP to explain other black-box machine learning models, or explain the models evolved by GP by simpler models such as linear models. This comprehensive survey demonstrates the strong potential of GP for improving the interpretability of machine learning models and balancing the complex tradeoff between model accuracy and interpretability.

AB  - In certain healthcare settings, such as emergency or critical care units, where quick and accurate real-time analysis and decision-making are required, the healthcare system can leverage the power of artificial intelligence (AI) models to support decision-making and prevent complications. This paper investigates the optimization of healthcare AI models based on time complexity, hyper-parameter tuning, and XAI for a classification task. The paper highlights the significance of a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) for analysing and classifying Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in real-time and is compared with CNN-RandomForest (CNN-RF). The role of hyper-parameter is also examined in finding optimal configurations that enhance the model's performance while efficiently utilizing the limited computational resources. Finally, the benefits of incorporating the XAI technique (e.g. GradCAM and Layer-wise Relevance Propagation) in providing transparency and interpretable explanations of AI model predictions, fostering trust, and error/bias detection are explored. Our inference time on a MacBook laptop for 323 test images of size 100x100 is only 2.6 sec, which is merely 8 milliseconds per image while providing comparable classification accuracy with the ensemble model of CNN-RF classifiers. Using the proposed model, clinicians/cardiologists can achieve accurate and reliable results while ensuring patients' safety and answering questions imposed by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The proposed investigative study will advance the understanding and acceptance of AI systems in connected healthcare settings.

AB  - Gaining clinicians' trust will unleash the full potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine, and explaining AI decisions is seen as the way to build trustworthy systems. However, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods in medicine often lack a proper evaluation. In this paper, we present our evaluation methodology for XAI methods using forward simulatability. We define the Forward Simulatability Score (FSS) and analyze its limitations in the context of clinical predictors. Then, we applied FSS to our XAI approach defined over an ML-RO, a machine learning clinical predictor based on random optimization over a multiple kernel support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. To Compare FSS values before and after the explanation phase, we test our evaluation methodology for XAI methods on three clinical datasets, namely breast cancer, VTE, and migraine. The ML-RO system is a good model on which to test our XAI evaluation strategy based on the FSS. Indeed, ML-RO outperforms two other base models-a decision tree (DT) and a plain SVM-in the three datasets and gives the possibility of defining different XAI models: TOPK, MIGF, and F4G. The FSS evaluation score suggests that the explanation method F4G for the ML-RO is the most effective in two datasets out of the three tested, and it shows the limits of the learned model for one dataset. Our study aims to introduce a standard practice for evaluating XAI methods in medicine. By establishing a rigorous evaluation framework, we seek to provide healthcare professionals with reliable tools for assessing the performance of XAI methods to enhance the adoption of AI systems in clinical practice.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease, which remains one of the main causes of death, can be prevented by early diagnosis of heart sounds. Certain noisy signals, known as murmurs, may be present in heart sounds. On auscultation, the degree of murmur is closely related to the patient's clinical condition. Computer-aided decision-making systems can help doctors to detect murmurs and make faster decisions. The Mel spectrograms were generated from raw phonocardiograms and then presented to the OpenL3 network for transfer learning. In this way, the signals were classified to predict the presence or absence of murmurs and their level of severity. Pitch level (healthy, low, medium, high) and Levine scale (healthy, soft, loud) were used. The results obtained without prior segmentation are very impressive. The model used was then interpreted using an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) method, Occlusion Sensitivity. This approach shows that XAI methods are necessary to know the features used internally by the artificial neural network then to explain the automatic decision taken by the model. The averaged image of the occlusion sensitivity maps can give us either an overview or a precise detail per pixel of the features used. In the field of healthcare, particularly cardiology, for rapid diagnostic and preventive purposes, this work could provide more detail on the important features of the phonocardiogram.

AB  - In this study, we present a novel approach for predicting interventions for patients in the intensive care unit using a multivariate time series graph convolutional neural network. Our method addresses two critical challenges: the need for timely and accurate decisions based on changing physiological signals, drug administration information, and static characteristics; and the need for interpretability in the decision-making process. Drawing on real-world ICU records from the MIMIC-III dataset, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves upon existing machine learning and deep learning methods for predicting two targeted interventions, mechanical ventilation and vasopressors. Our model achieved an accuracy improvement from 81.6% to 91.9% and a F1 score improvement from 0.524 to 0.606 for predicting mechanical ventilation interventions. For predicting vasopressor interventions, our model achieved an accuracy improvement from 76.3% to 82.7% and a F1 score improvement from 0.509 to 0.619. We also assessed the interpretability by performing an adjacency matrix importance analysis, which revealed that our model uses clinically meaningful and appropriate features for prediction. This critical aspect can help clinicians gain insights into the underlying mechanisms of interventions, allowing them to make more informed and precise clinical decisions. Overall, our study represents a significant step forward in the development of decision support systems for ICU patient care, providing a powerful tool for improving clinical outcomes and enhancing patient safety.

AB  - Explainable AI (XAI) frameworks are becoming essential in many areas, including the medical field, as they help us to understand AI decisions, increasing clinical trust and improving patient care. This research presents a robust and comprehensive Explainable AI framework. To classify images from the BloodMNIST and Raabin-WBC datasets, various pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures: the VGG, the ResNet, the DenseNet, the EfficientNet, the MobileNet variants, the SqueezeNet, and the Xception are implemented both individually and in combination with SpinalNet. For parameter analysis, four models, VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, and ResNet101, were combined with SpinalNet. Notably, these SpinalNet hybrid models significantly reduced the model parameters while maintaining or even improving the model accuracy. For example, the VGG 16 + SpinalNet shows a 40.74% parameter reduction and accuracy of 98.92% (BloodMnist) and 98.32% (Raabin-WBC). Similarly, the combinations of VGG19, ResNet50, and ResNet101 with SpinalNet resulted in weight parameter reductions by 36.36%, 65.33%, and 52.13%, respectively, with improved accuracy for both datasets. These hybrid SpinalNet models are highly efficient and well-suited for resource-limited environments. The authors have developed a dynamic model selection framework. This framework optimally selects the best models based on prediction scores, prioritizing lightweight models in cases of ties. This method guarantees that for every input, the most effective model is used, which results in higher accuracy as well as better outcomes. Explainable AI (XAI) techniques: Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), SHapley Additive ExPlanations (SHAP), and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) are implemented. These help us to understand the key features that influence the model predictions. By combining these XAI methods with dynamic model selection, this research not only achieves excellent accuracy but also provides useful insights into the elements that influence model predictions.

AB  - Deep learning-based models have revolutionized medical diagnostics by using Big Data to enhance disease diagnosis and clinical decision-making. However, their significant computational demands and opaque decision-making processes, often characterized as "black-box" systems, pose major challenges in time-critical and resource-constrained healthcare settings. To address these issues, this study explores the application of randomized machine learning models, specifically Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) and Random Vector Functional Link (RVFL) networks, in medical diagnostics. These models introduce stochasticity into their training processes, reducing computational complexity and training times while maintaining accuracy. Furthermore, we integrate Explainable AI techniques namely Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to explain the decision-making rationale of ELMs and RVFL. Performance evaluations on genitourinary cancers and coronary artery disease datasets demonstrate that RVFL outperforms traditional deep learning models, achieving superior accuracy of 88.29% with a computational overhead of 6.22 seconds for genitourinary cancers, and an accuracy of 81.64% with a computational time of 0.0308 seconds for coronary artery disease. This research highlights the potential of randomized models in enhancing efficiency and transparency in medical diagnosis, thereby accelerating better treatment outcomes and advocating for more accessible and interpretable AI solutions in healthcare.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for intelligent mobile computing in healthcare has opened up new opportunities in healthcare systems. Combining AI techniques with the existing Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) will enhance the quality of care that patients receive at home remotely and the successful establishment of smart living environments. Building a real AI for mobile AI in an integrated smart hospital environment is a challenging problem due to the complexities of receiving IoT medical sensors data, data analysis, and deep learning algorithm complexity programming for mobile AI engine implementation AI-based cloud computing complexities, especially when we tackle real-time environments of AI technologies. In this paper, we propose a new mobile AI smart hospital platform architecture for stroke prediction and emergencies. In addition, this research is focused on developing and testing different modules of integrated AI software based on XAI architecture, this is for the mobile health app as an independent expert system or as connected with a simulated environment of an AI-cloud-based solution. The novelty is in the integrated architecture and results obtained in our previous works and this extended research on hybrid GMDH and LSTM deep learning models for the proposed artificial intelligence and IoMT engine for mobile health edge computing technology. Its main goal is to predict heart-stroke disease. Current research is still missing a mobile AI system for heart/brain stroke prediction during patient emergency cases. This research work implements AI algorithms for stroke prediction and diagnosis. The hybrid AI in connected health is based on a stacked CNN and group handling method (GMDH) predictive analytics model, enhanced with an LSTM deep learning module for biomedical signals prediction. The techniques developed depend on the dataset of electromyography (EMG) signals, which provides a significant source of information for the identification of normal and abnormal motions in a stroke scenario. The resulting artificial intelligence mHealth app is an innovation beyond the state of the art and the proposed techniques achieve high accuracy as stacked CNN reaches almost 98% for stroke diagnosis. The GMDH neural network proves to be a good technique for monitoring the EMG signal of the same patient case with an average accuracy of 98.60% to an average of 96.68% of the signal prediction. Moreover, extending the GMDH model and a hybrid LSTM with dense layers deep learning model has improved significantly the prediction results that reach an average of 99%.

AB  - Accurate segmentation and categorization of brain abnormalities are needed for effective diagnosis and treatment planning. Computer-aided diagnostic techniques have gained popularity for supporting healthcare providers in identifying diseases accurately and predicting their findings. This manuscript presents a promising hybrid Liquid Neural Network(LNN) combined with Path Aggregation Neural Network (PA-NET) and ResNet50 for improving the identification and categorization of brain abnormalities. An EXplainable Artificial Intelligence(XAI) based panoptic brain tumor segmentation for automatic tumor diagnosis is presented to achieve detailed segmentation maps considering uncertainties such as shape, location, etc. Specifically, by utilizing neural networks, the LNN-PA-Net with ResNet50 model automatically extracts significant features from brain pictures that capture both local and external patterns. The primary objectives of this work is to remove uncertainties regarding the brain image, improve the accuracy of tumor identification, and increase the patient's confidence in the medical professionals. Additionally, integrating XAI techniques by a pyramid Grad-CAM++ improves the interpretability and transparency of this model. This approach achieved an accuracy rate of 99.4%, 98.7% and dice scores of 99.29%, 98.85% for the datasets BraTs 2019 and BraTs 2021. Moreover, the LNN-PA-ResNet50 result shows that the presented model outperforms the previous methods. Integrating XAI into segmentation and classification improves the reliability of diagnosing brain tumors by offering insightful information on the decision-making process and trustworthy outcomes for physicians.

AB  - Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have garnered significant attention across various research domains due to their impressive performance, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), known for their exceptional accuracy in image processing tasks. However, the opaque nature of DNNs has raised concerns about their trustworthiness, as users often cannot understand how the model arrives at its predictions or decisions. This lack of transparency is particularly problematic in critical fields such as healthcare, finance, and law, where the stakes are high. Consequently, there has been a surge in the development of explanation methods for DNNs. Typically, the effectiveness of these methods is assessed subjectively via human observation on the heatmaps or attribution maps generated by eXplanation AI (XAI) methods. In this paper, a novel GeoStatistics Explainable Artificial Intelligence (GSEAI) framework is proposed, which integrates spatial pattern analysis from Geostatistics with XAI algorithms to assess and compare XAI understandability. Global and local Moran's I indices, commonly used to assess the spatial autocorrelation of geographic data, assist in comprehending the spatial distribution patterns of attribution maps produced by the XAI method, through measuring the levels of aggregation or dispersion. Interpreting and analyzing attribution maps by Moran's I scattergram and LISA clustering maps provide an accurate global objective quantitative assessment of the spatial distribution of feature attribution and achieves a more understandable local interpretation. In this paper, we conduct experiments on aircraft detection in SAR images based on the widely used YOLOv5 network, and evaluate four mainstream XAI methods quantitatively and qualitatively. By using GSEAI to perform explanation analysis of the given DNN, we could gain more insights about the behavior of the network, to enhance the trustworthiness of DNN applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time XAI has been integrated with geostatistical algorithms in SAR domain knowledge, which expands the analytical approaches of XAI and also promotes the development of XAI within SAR image analytics.

AB  - Deep neural networks (DNNs) are an indispensable machine learning tool despite the difficulty of diagnosing what aspects of a model's input drive its decisions. In countless real-world domains, from legislation and law enforcement to healthcare, such diagnosis is essential to ensure that DNN decisions are driven by aspects appropriate in the context of its use. The development of methods and studies enabling the explanation of a DNN's decisions has thus blossomed into an active and broad area of research. The field's complexity is exacerbated by competing definitions of what it means "to explain" the actions of a DNN and to evaluate an approach's "ability to explain". This article offers a field guide to explore the space of explainable deep learning for those in the AI/ML field who are uninitiated. The field guide: i) Introduces three simple dimensions defining the space of foundational methods that contribute to explainable deep learning, ii) discusses the evaluations for model explanations, iii) places explainability in the context of other related deep learning research areas, and iv) discusses user-oriented explanation design and future directions. We hope the guide is seen as a starting point for those embarking on this research field.

AB  - Healthcare agents, in particular in the oncology field, are currently collecting vast amounts of diverse patient data. In this context, some decision-support systems, mostly based on deep learning techniques, have already been approved for clinical purposes. Despite all the efforts in introducing artificial intelligence methods in the workflow of clinicians, its lack of interpretability - understand how the methods make decisions - still inhibits their dissemination in clinical practice. The aim of this article is to present an easy guide for oncologists explaining how these methods make decisions and illustrating the strategies to explain them. Theoretical concepts were illustrated based on oncological examples and a literature review of research works was performed from PubMed between January 2014 to September 2020, using "deep learning techniques," "interpretability" and "oncology" as keywords. Overall, more than 60% are related to breast, skin or brain cancers and the majority focused on explaining the importance of tumor characteristics (e.g. dimension, shape) in the predictions. The most used computational methods are multilayer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks. Nevertheless, despite being successfully applied in different cancers scenarios, endowing deep learning techniques with interpretability, while maintaining their performance, continues to be one of the greatest challenges of artificial intelligence.

AB  - Deep learning methods have proven to be effective for multiple diagnostic tasks in medicine and have been performing significantly better in comparison to other traditional machine learning methods. However, the black-box nature of deep neural networks has restricted their use in real-world applications, especially in healthcare. Therefore, explainability of the machine learning models, which focuses on providing of the comprehensible explanations of model outputs, may affect the possibility of adoption of such models in clinical use. There are various studies reviewing approaches to explainability in multiple domains. This article provides a review of the current approaches and applications of explainable deep learning for a specific area of medical data analysis???medical video processing tasks. The article introduces the field of explainable AI and summarizes the most important requirements for explainability in medical applications. Subsequently, we provide an overview of existing methods, evaluation metrics and focus more on those that can be applied to analytical tasks involving the processing of video data in the medical domain. Finally we identify some of the open research issues in the analysed area.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) play a crucial role in developing disruptive healthcare technologies since they address the needs of consumers by providing precise and effective diagnostic and decision-making capabilities. The influence of these factors on diagnosing and making decisions is especially noteworthy when collecting valuable information from healthcare data. This work offers "AC2" (Accurate Cardiac Classification), a hybrid deep learning model that correctly detects cardiovascular disease (CVD) and provides meaningful insights. Convolutional neural networks and the Light Gradient Boosting Model integrate well in the "AC2" model, simplifying feature learning and predictions. Using the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset, the proposed method outperforms current algorithms in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This dataset collects reliable, state-specific data on preventive health practices and risk behaviors related to chronic illnesses, injuries, and avoidable infections in adults, catering to the information needs of healthcare consumers. The "AC2" model's outstanding forecast accuracy is further improved by integrating an explainable AI methodology, specifically emphasizing SHAP's local and global explanations. These explanatory insights clarify the model's decision-making process. With healthcare technology's advancement and the requirement for efficient data analysis to gather information, the "AC2" model's accuracy and comprehensibility may substantially improve healthcare professionals' diagnosis and treatment skills, benefiting healthcare consumers.

AB  - Microbiome has emerged as a promising indicator or predictor of human diseases. However, previous studies have typically labeled each specimen as either healthy or with a specific disease, ignoring prevalence of complications or comorbidities in actual cohorts, which may confound the microbial-disease associations. For instance, a patient may suffer from multiple diseases, making it challenging to detect their health status accurately. Furthermore, host phenotypes like physiological characteristics and lifestyles can alter microbiome structure, but such information has not yet been fully utilized in data models. To address these issues, a highly explainable deep learning (DL) method called Meta-Spec is proposed. Using a deep neural network (DNN)-based approach, it encodes and embeds refined host variables with microbiome features, enabling the detection of multiple diseases simultaneously. Experiments show that Meta-Spec outperforms regular machine learning (ML) strategies for multilabel disease screening in several cohorts. More importantly, Meta-Spec successfully detects comorbidities that are often missed by other approaches. In addition, for its high interpretability, Meta-Spec captures key factors that shape disease patterns from host variables and microbes. Hence, these efforts improve the feasibility and sensitivity of microbiome-based disease screening in practical scenarios, representing a significant step toward personalized medicine and better health outcomes.
   Herein, Meta-Spec is presented, which is a highly explainable deep learning framework for microbiome-based multidisease detection. Using a deep neural network-based approach, Meta-Spec embeds the refined host variables with microbiome features, enabling the classification of multiple diseases simultaneously. It outperforms regular models for multilabel disease screening and detects comorbidities that are often missed.image & COPY; 2023 WILEY-VCH GmbH

AB  - Despite advances in precision oncology, clinical decision-making still relies on limited variables and expert knowledge. To address this limitation, we combined multimodal real-world data and explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) to introduce AI-derived (AID) markers for clinical decision support. We used xAI to decode the outcome of 15,726 patients across 38 solid cancer entities based on 350 markers, including clinical records, image-derived body compositions, and mutational tumor profiles. xAI determined the prognostic contribution of each clinical marker at the patient level and identified 114 key markers that accounted for 90% of the neural network's decision process. Moreover, xAI enabled us to uncover 1,373 prognostic interactions between markers. Our approach was validated in an independent cohort of 3,288 patients with lung cancer from a US nationwide electronic health record-derived database. These results show the potential of xAI to transform the assessment of clinical variables and enable personalized, data-driven cancer care.

AB  - Autoimmune disorders (AID) present significant challenges due to their complex etiologies and diverse clinical manifestations. Traditional diagnostic methods, which rely on symptom observation and biomarker detection, often lack specificity and fail to provide personalized treatment options. This study proposes ImmunoNet, a deep learning-based framework that integrates genetic, molecular, and clinical data to enhance the accuracy of autoimmune disease diagnosis and treatment. ImmunoNet leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to analyze large-scale datasets, enabling precise disease classification and personalized therapeutic treatment recommendations. The model improves interpretability through explainable AI techniques and enhances privacy via federated learning. Comparative evaluations demonstrate that ImmunoNet outperforms traditional machine learning models, achieving a 98% accuracy rate in predicting autoimmune disorders. By advancing precision medicine in immunology, this approach provides clinicians with a powerful tool for personalized diagnosis and optimized therapeutic strategies.

AB  - The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) represents a transformative advancement in the early detection and management of biliopancreatic lesions. This review highlights the current state of AI-enhanced EUS (AI-EUS) for diagnosing solid and cystic pancreatic lesions, as well as biliary diseases. AI-driven models, including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), have shown significant improvements in diagnostic accuracy, particularly in distinguishing pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from benign conditions and in the characterization of pancreatic cystic neoplasms. Advanced algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), enable precise image analysis, real-time lesion classification, and integration with clinical and genomic data for personalized care. In biliary diseases, AI-assisted systems enhance bile duct visualization and streamline diagnostic workflows, minimizing operator dependency. Emerging applications, such as AI-guided EUS fine-needle aspiration (FNA) and biopsy (FNB), improve diagnostic yields while reducing errors. Despite these advancements, challenges remain, including data standardization, model interpretability, and ethical concerns regarding data privacy. Future developments aim to integrate multimodal imaging, real-time procedural support, and predictive analytics to further refine the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of AI-EUS. AI-driven innovation in EUS stands poised to revolutionize pancreatico-biliary diagnostics, facilitating earlier detection, enhancing precision, and paving the way for personalized medicine in gastrointestinal oncology and beyond.

AB  - Introduction Machine performance has surpassed human capabilities in various tasks, yet the opacity of complex models limits their adoption in critical fields such as healthcare. Explainable AI (XAI) has emerged to address this by enhancing transparency and trust in AI decision-making. However, a persistent gap exists between interpretability and performance, as black-box models, such as deep neural networks, often outperform white-box models, such as regression-based approaches. To bridge this gap, the Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM), a class of generalized additive models has been introduced, combining the strengths of interpretable and high-performing models. EBM may be particularly well-suited for cognitive health research, where traditional models struggle to capture nonlinear effects in cognitive aging and account for inter- and intra-individual variability.Methods This cross-sectional study applies EBM to investigate the relationship between demographic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, and cognitive performance in a sample of 3,482 healthy older adults. The EBM's performance is compared against Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, Multilayer Perceptron, and Extreme Gradient Boosting, evaluating predictive accuracy and interpretability.Results The findings reveal that EBM provides valuable insights into cognitive aging, surpassing traditional models while maintaining competitive accuracy with more complex machine learning approaches. Notably, EBM highlights variations in how lifestyle activities impact cognitive performance, particularly differences between engaging in and refraining from specific activities, challenging regression-based assumptions. Moreover, our results show that the effects of lifestyle factors are heterogeneous across cognitive groups, with some individuals demonstrating significant cognitive changes while others remain resilient to these influences.Discussion These findings highlight EBM's potential in cognitive aging research, offering both interpretability and accuracy to inform personalized strategies for mitigating cognitive decline. By bridging the gap between explainability and performance, this study advances the use of XAI in healthcare and cognitive aging research.

AB  - Lung cancer remains a leading cause of global cancer mortality, demanding improved early detection and personalized therapies. This study introduces an innovative framework integrating deep learning (DL), radiomics, and explainable AI (XAI) to significantly advance lung nodule analysis and predict actionable genetic mutations. We synergize advanced neural networks (U-Net, DeepLabV3 for segmentation; YOLOv7 for detection) with comprehensive radiomic features (texture, shape, intensity) to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our approach yields a segmentation Dice coefficient of 93.5% and accuracy of 98.5%, outperforming existing methods by 5-8%, while effectively reducing false positives. Crucially, we leverage XAI, specifically Grad-CAM visualizations with ResNet models, to link nodule morphology-particularly edge-associated vascular patterns-to clinically relevant EGFR and KRAS mutations. This provides unprecedented transparency, bridging AI-driven image analysis with underlying oncogenic mechanisms. Our ResNet-based classifiers achieve high accuracy for mutation prediction (97.6% EGFR, 97.7% KRAS), validated through stratified 10-fold cross-validation. By demystifying model decisions, XAI fosters clinical trust and empowers clinicians to correlate imaging phenotypes with genotypic alterations, paving the way for more precise diagnostics and treatment planning. We also discuss model fairness, computational efficiency, and outline clear future directions for clinical translation.

AB  - BackgroundThe interpretability of results predicted by the machine learning models is vital, especially in the critical fields like healthcare. With the increasingly adoption of electronic healthcare records (EHR) by the medical organizations in the last decade, which accumulated abundant electronic patient data, neural networks or deep learning techniques are gradually being applied to clinical tasks by utilizing the huge potential of EHR data. However, typical deep learning models are black-boxes, which are not transparent and the prediction outcomes of which are difficult to interpret.MethodsTo remedy this limitation, we propose an attention neural network model for interpretable clinical prediction. In detail, the proposed model employs an attention mechanism to capture critical/essential features with their attention signals on the prediction results, such that the predictions generated by the neural network model can be interpretable.ResultsWe evaluate our proposed model on a real-world clinical dataset consisting of 736 samples to predict readmissions for heart failure patients. The performance of the proposed model achieved 66.7 and 69.1% in terms of accuracy and AUC, respectively, and outperformed the baseline models. Besides, we displayed patient-specific attention weights, which can not only help clinicians understand the prediction outcomes, but also assist them to select individualized treatment strategies or intervention plans.ConclusionsThe experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model can improve both the prediction performance and interpretability by equipping the model with an attention mechanism.

AB  - The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into point-of-care testing (POCT) represents a transformative leap in modern healthcare, addressing critical challenges in diagnostic accuracy, workflow efficiency, and equitable access. While POCT has revolutionized decentralized care through rapid results, its potential is hindered by variability in accuracy, integration hurdles, and resource constraints. AI technologies-encompassing machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing-offer robust solutions: convolutional neural networks improve malaria detection in sub-Saharan Africa to 95 % sensitivity, while predictive analytics reduce device downtime by 20 % in resource-limited settings. AI-driven decision support systems curtail antibiotic misuse by 40 % through real-time data synthesis, and portable AI devices enable anaemia screening in rural India with 94 % accuracy, slashing diagnostic delays from weeks to hours. Despite these advancements, challenges persist, including data privacy risks, algorithmic opacity, and infrastructural gaps in low-and middle-income countries. Explainable AI frameworks and blockchain encryption are critical to building clinician trust and ensuring regulatory compliance. Future directions emphasize the convergence of AI with Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain for predictive diagnostics, as demonstrated by AI-IoT systems forecasting dengue outbreaks 14 days in advance. Personalized medicine, powered by genomic and wearable data integration, further underscores AI potential to tailor therapies, reducing cardiovascular events by 25 %. Realizing this vision demands interdisciplinary collaboration, ethical governance, and equitable implementation to bridge global health disparities. By harmonizing innovation with accessibility, AI-enhanced POCT emerges as a cornerstone of proactive, patient-centered healthcare, poised to democratize diagnostics and drive sustainable health equity worldwide.

AB  - This article presents a deep learning approach for classifying the developmental stages (larvae, nymphs, adult females, and adult males) of Ixodes ricinus ticks, the most common tick species in Europe and a major vector of tick-borne pathogens, including Borrelia burgdorferi, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). Each developmental stage plays a different role in disease transmission, with nymphs considered the most epidemiologically relevant stage due to their small size and high prevalence. We developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained on a dataset of microscopic tick images collected in the area of Upper Silesia, Poland. Grad-CAM, an XAI technique, was used to identify the regions of the image that most influenced the model's decisions. This work is the first to utilize a CNN model for the identification of European tick fauna stages. Compared to existing solutions focused on North American tick species, our model addresses the specific challenge of distinguishing developmental stages within I. ricinus. This solution has the potential to be a valuable tool in entomology, healthcare, and tick-borne disease management.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI), a branch of computer science focused on developing algorithms that replicate intelligent behaviour, has recently been used in patients management by enhancing diagnostic and prognostic capabilities of various resources such as hospital datasets, electrocardiograms and echocardiographic acquisitions. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models, both key subsets of AI, have demonstrated robust applications across several cardiovascular diseases, from the most diffuse like hypertension and ischemic heart disease to the rare infiltrative cardiomyopathies, as well as to estimation of LDL cholesterol which can be achieved with better accuracy through AI.Additional emerging applications are encountered when unsupervised ML methodology shows promising results in identifying distinct clusters or phenotypes of patients with atrial fibrillation that may have different risks of stroke and response to therapy.Interestingly, since ML techniques do not analyse the possibility that a specific pathology can occur but rather the trajectory of each subject and the chain of events that lead to the occurrence of various cardiovascular pathologies, it has been considered that DL, by resembling the complexity of human brain and using artificial neural networks, might support clinical management through the processing of large amounts of complex information; however, external validity of algorithms cannot be taken for granted, while interpretability of the results may be an issue, also known as a "black box" problem. Notwithstanding these considerations, facilities and governments are willing to unlock the potential of AI in order to reach the final step of healthcare advancements while ensuring that patient safety and equity are preserved.Artificial intelligence (AI), a branch of computer science focused on developing algorithms that replicate intelligent behaviour, has recently been used in patients management by enhancing diagnostic and prognostic capabilities of various resources such as hospital datasets, electrocardiograms and echocardiographic acquisitions.

AB  - The increasing adoption of DNNs in critical domains such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems underscores the growing importance of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). In these high-stakes applications, understanding the decision-making processes of models is essential for ensuring trust and safety. However, traditional DNNs often function as "black boxes," delivering accurate predictions without providing insight into the factors driving their outputs. Expected gradients (EG) is a prominent method for making such explanations by calculating the contribution of each input feature to the final decision. Despite its effectiveness, conventional baselines used in state-of-the-art implementations of EG often lack a clear definition of what constitutes "missing" information. This study proposes DeepPrior-EG, a deep prior-guided EG framework for leveraging prior knowledge to more accurately align with the concept of missingness and enhance interpretive fidelity. It resolves the baseline misalignment by initiating gradient path integration from learned prior baselines, which are derived from the deep features of CNN layers. This approach not only mitigates feature absence artifacts but also amplifies critical feature contributions through adaptive gradient aggregation. This study further introduces two probabilistic prior modeling strategies: a multivariate Gaussian model (MGM) to capture high-dimensional feature interdependencies and a Bayesian nonparametric Gaussian mixture model (BGMM) that autonomously infers mixture complexity for heterogeneous feature distributions. An explanation-driven model retraining paradigm is also implemented to validate the robustness of the proposed framework. Comprehensive evaluations across various qualitative and quantitative metrics demonstrate its superior interpretability. The BGMM variant achieves competitive performance in attribution quality and faithfulness against existing methods. DeepPrior-EG advances the interpretability of complex models within the XAI landscape and unlocks their potential in safety-critical applications.

AB  - Machine learning techniques are increasingly gaining attention due to their widespread use in various disciplines across academia and industry. Despite their tremendous success, many such techniques suffer from the "black-box" problem, which refers to situations where the data analyst is unable to explain why such techniques arrive at certain decisions. This problem has fuelled interest in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), which refers to techniques that can easily be interpreted by humans. Unfortunately, many of these techniques are not suitable for tabular data, which is surprising given the importance and widespread use of tabular data in critical applications such as finance, healthcare, and criminal justice. Also surprising is the fact that, despite the vast literature on XAI, there are still no survey articles to date that focus on tabular data. Consequently, despite the existing survey articles that cover a wide range of XAI techniques, it remains challenging for researchers working on tabular data to go through all of these surveys and extract the techniques that are suitable for their analysis. Our article fills this gap by providing a comprehensive and up-to-date survey of the XAI techniques that are relevant to tabular data. Furthermore, we categorize the references covered in our survey, indicating the type of the model being explained, the approach being used to provide the explanation, and the XAI problem being addressed. Our article is the first to provide researchers with a map that helps them navigate the XAI literature in the context of tabular data.

AB  - Purpose: This concise review aims to explore the potential for the clinical implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) strategies for detecting glaucoma and monitoring glaucoma progression.
   Methods: Nonsystematic literature review using the search combinations "Artificial Intelligence," "Deep Learning," "Machine Learning," "Neural Networks," "Bayesian Networks," "Glaucoma Diagnosis," and "Glaucoma Progression." Information on sensitivity and specificity regarding glaucoma diagnosis and progression analysis as well as methodological details were extracted.
   Results: Numerous AI strategies provide promising levels of specificity and sensitivity for structural (e.g. optical coherence tomography [OCT] imaging, fundus photography) and functional (visual field [VF] testing) test modalities used for the detection of glaucoma. Area under receiver operating curve (AROC) values of > 0.90 were achieved with every modality. Combining structural and functional inputs has been shown to even more improve the diagnostic ability. Regarding glaucoma progression, AI strategies can detect progression earlier than conventional methods or potentially from one single VF test.
   Conclusions: AI algorithms applied to fundus photographs for screening purposes may provide good results using a simple and widely accessible test. However, for patients who are likely to have glaucoma more sophisticated methods should be used including data from OCT and perinnetry. Outputs may serve as an adjunct to assist clinical decision making, whereas also enhancing the efficiency, productivity, and quality of the delivery of glaucoma care. Patients with diagnosed glaucoma may benefitfronn future algorithms to evaluate their risk of progression. Challenges are yet to be overcome, including the external validity of AI strategies, a move from a "black box" toward "explainable AI," and likely regulatory hurdles. However, it is clear that AI can enhance the role of specialist clinicians and will inevitably shape the future of the delivery of glaucoma care to the next generation.
   Translational Relevance: The promising levels of diagnostic accuracy reported by AI strategies across the modalities used in clinical practice for glaucoma detection can pave the way for the development of reliable models appropriate for their translation into clinical practice. Future incorporation of AI into healthcare models may help address the current limitations of access and timely management of patients with glaucoma across the world.

AB  - Breast cancer (BC) is a common and highly lethal ailment. It stands as the second leading contributor to cancerrelated deaths in women worldwide. The timely identification of this condition is of utmost importance in mitigating mortality rates. This research paper presents a novel framework for the precise identification of BC, utilising a combination of image and numerical data features with explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). The utilisation of the U-NET transfer learning model is employed for image-based prediction. Additionally, an ensemble model is constructed by integrating characteristics from a customised convolutional neural network (CNN) model with an ensemble comprising random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM). The experiments aim to evaluate the influence of original features compared to convoluted features. A comparative analysis is carried out to assess the efficacy of various classifiers in accurately detecting BC, utilising the Wisconsin dataset. The model under consideration exhibits promising capabilities in enhancing BC diagnosis, with a remarkable accuracy rate of 99.99%. The present study contributes to the advancement of BC diagnosis by introducing a novel strategy based on machine learning and discussing the interpretation of the variables using XAI. The primary objective of this approach is to get a notable level of precision, hence facilitating the early and reliable identification of BC. Ultimately, the implementation of this approach is expected to enhance patient outcomes.

AB  - Background: Neonatal low birth weight (LBW) is a significant predictor of increased morbidity and mortality among newborns. Predominantly, traditional prediction methods depend heavily on ultrasonography, which does not consider risk factors affecting birth weight (BW). Objective: This study introduces a robust deep neural network for a clinical decision-support system designed to early predict neonatal BW, using data available during early pregnancy, with enhanced precision. This innovative system incorporates a comprehensive array of maternal factors, placing particular emphasis on nutritional elements alongside physiological and lifestyle variables. Methods: We employed and validated various traditional machine learning models as well as an interpretable deep learning model using the TabNet architecture, noted for its proficient handling of tabular data and high level of interpretability. The efficacy of these models was evaluated against extensive datasets that encompass a broad spectrum of maternal health indicators. Results: The TabNet model exhibited outstanding predictive capabilities, achieving an accuracy of 96% and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.96. Significantly, maternal vitamin B12 and folate status emerged as pivotal predictors of BW, emphasizing the crucial role of nutritional factors in influencing neonatal health outcomes. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the substantial benefits of integrating multimodal maternal factors into predictive models for neonatal BW, markedly enhancing the precision over traditional AI methods. The developed decision-support system not only has a possible application in prenatal care but also provides actionable insights that can be leveraged to mitigate the risks associated with LBW, thereby improving clinical decision-making processes and outcomes.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly used in healthcare applications, although some challenges have not been completely overcome to make them fully trustworthy and compliant with modern regulations and societal needs. First of all, sensitive health data, essential to train AI systems, are typically stored and managed in several separate medical centers and cannot be shared due to privacy constraints, thus hindering the use of all available information in learning models. Further, transparency and explainability of such systems are becoming increasingly urgent, especially at a time when "opaque" or "black-box" models are commonly used. Recently, technological and algorithmic solutions to these challenges have been investigated: on the one hand, federated learning (FL) has been proposed as a paradigm for collaborative model training among multiple parties without any disclosure of private raw data; on the other hand, research on eXplainable AI (XAI) aims to enhance the explainability of AI systems, either through interpretable by-design approaches or post-hoc explanation techniques. In this paper, we focus on a healthcare case study, namely predicting the progression of Parkinson's disease, and assume that raw data originate from different medical centers and data collection for centralized training is precluded due to privacy limitations. We aim to investigate how FL of XAI models can allow achieving a good level of accuracy and trustworthiness. Cognitive and biologically inspired approaches are adopted in our analysis: FL of an interpretable by-design fuzzy rule-based system and FL of a neural network explained using a federated version of the SHAP post-hoc explanation technique. We analyze accuracy, interpretability, and explainability of the two approaches, also varying the degree of heterogeneity across several data distribution scenarios. Although the neural network is generally more accurate, the results show that the fuzzy rule-based system achieves competitive performance in the federated setting and presents desirable properties in terms of interpretability and transparency.

AB  - Background: Accurately diagnosing brain tumors from MRI scans is crucial for effective treatment planning. While traditional methods heavily rely on radiologist expertise, the integration of AI, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has shown promise in improving accuracy. However, the lack of transparency in AI decision-making processes presents a challenge for clinical adoption. Methods: Recent advancements in deep learning, particularly the utilization of CNNs, have facilitated the development of models for medical image analysis. In this study, we employed the EfficientNetB0 architecture and integrated explainable AI techniques to enhance both accuracy and interpretability. Grad-CAM visualization was utilized to highlight significant areas in MRI scans influencing classification decisions. Results: Our model achieved a classification accuracy of 98.72 % across four categories of brain tumors (Glioma, Meningioma, No Tumor, Pituitary), with precision and recall exceeding 97 % for all categories. The incorporation of explainable AI techniques was validated through visual inspection of Grad-CAM heatmaps, which aligned well with established diagnostic markers in MRI scans. Conclusion: The AI-enhanced EfficientNetB0 framework with explainable AI techniques significantly improves brain tumor classification accuracy to 98.72 %, offering clear visual insights into the decision-making process. This method enhances diagnostic reliability and trust, demonstrating substantial potential for clinical adoption in medical diagnostics.

AB  - Online social networks can be used for mental healthcare monitoring using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques for detecting various mental health disorders and corresponding risk assessment. Recent research in this domain has primarily been focused on leveraging deep neural networks and various Transformer based Large Language Models, which have now become state-of-the-art for most natural language processing and computational linguistic tasks due to their unmatched prediction accuracy. Unlike conventional machine learning algorithms, these deep neural networks are black box architectures, where it is difficult to interpret and explain their predicted outcome. However, a black box classification outcome is insufficient for healthcare applications. Such systems will not be widely adopted and trusted by healthcare practitioners if they are not able to understand and explain the reasoning behind the predicted decisions made by an AI and ML based healthcare diagnostic system. The key objective of our research is to demonstrate the applications of model agnostic, post hoc surrogate XAI techniques for providing explainability to classification decisions of pretrained LLMs (Transformers) based mental healthcare diagnostic systems fine-tuned (or trained) to detect depressive and suicidal behavior using UGC from online social networks. For this, we have used the two most recent and popular techniques, SHAP and LIME. We have conducted extensive and in-depth experiments with four datasets and six pretrained LLMs, three of which have already been domain-adapted using mental health related datasets. We have also performed Few Shot Learning experiments with these three pretrained mental health domain-adapted LLMs. The results of qualitative and descriptive data analysis in this paper demonstrate that in order to build a comprehensive understanding of a person's psychological state, emotion, and behavior and to discover the causes, symptoms, and triggers of mental health issues, it is essential to utilize eXplAInable (XAI) techniques with Transformer based LLMs (supervised). Alternatively, Transformer based unsupervised topic modeling technique BERTopic may be used for mental health risk monitoring and cause or symptom extraction when supervised training of LLMs is not feasible due to dataset annotation or availability challenges.

AB  - Background: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based medical devices and digital health technologies, including medical sensors, wearable health trackers, telemedicine, mobile health (mHealth), large language models (LLMs), and digital care twins (DCTs), significantly influence the process of clinical decision support systems (CDSS) in healthcare and medical applications. However, given the complexity of medical decisions, it is crucial that results generated by AI tools not only be correct but also carefully evaluated, understandable, and explainable to endusers, especially clinicians. The lack of interpretability in communicating AI clinical decisions can lead to mistrust among decision-makers and a reluctance to use these technologies. Objective: This paper systematically reviews the processes and challenges associated with interpretable machine learning (IML) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) within the healthcare and medical domains. Its main goals are to examine the processes of IML and XAI, their related methods, applications, and the implementation challenges they pose in digital health interventions (DHIs), particularly from a quality control perspective, to help understand and improve communication between AI systems and clinicians. The IML process is categorized into pre-processing interpretability, interpretable modeling, and post-processing interpretability. This paper aims to foster a comprehensive understanding of the significance of a robust interpretability approach in clinical decision support systems (CDSS) by reviewing related experimental results. The goal is to provide future researchers with insights for creating clinician-AI tools that are more communicable in healthcare decision support systems and offer a deeper understanding of their challenges. Methods: Our research questions, eligibility criteria, and primary goals were proved using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline and the PICO (population, intervention, control, and outcomes) method. We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases using sensitive and specific search strings. Subsequently, duplicate papers were removed using EndNote and Covidence. A two-phase selection process was then carried out on Covidence, starting with screening by title and abstract, followed by a full-text appraisal. The Meta Quality Appraisal Tool (MetaQAT) was used to assess the quality and risk of bias. Finally, a standardized data extraction tool was employed for reliable data mining. Results: The searches yielded 2,241 records, from which 555 duplicate papers were removed. During the title and abstract screening step, 958 papers were excluded, and the full-text review step excluded 482 studies. Subsequently, in quality and risk of bias assessment, 172 papers were removed. 74 publications were selected for data extraction, which formed 10 insightful reviews and 64 related experimental studies. Conclusion: The paper provides general definitions of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) in the medical domain and introduces a framework for interpretability in clinical decision support systems structured across three levels. It explores XAI-related health applications within each tier of this framework, underpinned by a review of related experimental findings. Furthermore, the paper engages in a detailed discussion of quality assessment tools for evaluating XAI in intelligent health systems. It also presents a step-by-step roadmap for implementing XAI in clinical settings.
   To direct future research toward bridging current gaps, the paper examines the importance of XAI models from various angles and acknowledges their limitations.

AB  - In the high-stakes realm of critical care, where daily decisions are crucial and clear communication is paramount, comprehending the rationale behind Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven decisions appears essential. While AI has the potential to improve decision-making, its complexity can hinder comprehension and adherence to its recommendations. "Explainable AI" (XAI) aims to bridge this gap, enhancing confidence among patients and doctors. It also helps to meet regulatory transparency requirements, offers actionable insights, and promotes fairness and safety. Yet, defining explainability and standardising assessments are ongoing challenges and balancing performance and explainability can be needed, even if XAI is a growing field.

AB  - Background: Drug response prediction is an important problem in computational personalized medicine. Many machine-learning-based methods, especially deep learning-based ones, have been proposed for this task. However, these methods often represent the drugs as strings, which are not a natural way to depict molecules. Also, interpretation (e.g., what are the mutation or copy number aberration contributing to the drug response) has not been considered thoroughly. Methods: In this study, we propose a novel method, GraphDRP, based on graph convolutional network for the problem. In GraphDRP, drugs were represented in molecular graphs directly capturing the bonds among atoms, meanwhile cell lines were depicted as binary vectors of genomic aberrations. Representative features of drugs and cell lines were learned by convolution layers, then combined to represent for each drug-cell line pair. Finally, the response value of each drug-cell line pair was predicted by a fully-connected neural network. Four variants of graph convolutional networks were used for learning the features of drugs. Results: We found that GraphDRP outperforms tCNNS in all performance measures for all experiments. Also, through saliency maps of the resulting GraphDRP models, we discovered the contribution of the genomic aberrations to the responses. Conclusion: Representing drugs as graphs can improve the performance of drug response prediction.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) integration in healthcare is revolutionizing medical analysis and disease prediction, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and patient care. However, with the growing adoption of AI, concerns surrounding trustworthiness, ethics, and transparency persist. This survey paper explores Trustworthy AI in healthcare, with a distinct focus on a patient-centric approach. By analyzing 132 relevant papers, we present a novel taxonomy across ten dimensions, emphasizing the criticality of safety, robustness, and patient trust. We highlight factors influencing trustworthiness and investigate the ethical frameworks guiding responsible AI deployment. A key contribution is the introduction of the Trustworthy AI Scoring System (TAI-SS), a novel framework to assess AI trustworthiness in healthcare, emphasizing ethics, privacy, and reliability. Case studies, such as AI-powered cancer diagnosis, demonstrate TAI-SS's practical application. Additionally, we discuss transparency through Explainable AI (XAI) techniques and segmentation approaches. Our analysis underscores the importance of healthcare datasets and AI algorithms while recommending seven Trustworthy AI requirements and four ethical principles. This paper serves as a roadmap for AI-driven, patient-centric healthcare, offering insights for researchers, healthcare professionals, and policymakers.

AB  - The interpretability of machine learning (ML) and neural networks has been attached great importance in medical-related applications. Considering random forest (RF) algorithm with self-explanatory function then integrating the concept of human-machine hybrid system, this paper proposes a expert-involved explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework for essential tremor (ET) action recognition, which assists to reveal the black-box model globally and locally, and to provide decision-making suggestions for medical practitioners. In addition, the human empirical judgment of clinical diagnosis is integrated into the action recognition process, which contributes to the model performance improvement and forms a dynamic and feedback loop. This paper collecting sensing data of six actions from 25 participants (20 ET patients and 5 healthy subjects) via smart phone monitoring system. Standardization, feature extraction and data segmentation are used to select the key features. The RF is used to train and test datasets with three different dimensions, and the six-dimensional dataset is selected for interpretable analysis, in which the expert rating data improve the recognition performance. Then, the feature importance, permutation importance, and Shapley additive exPlanations (SHAP) and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) methods are applied from abstract to concrete for model interpretability. The model-agnostic explainable approach are relatively flexible and universal, which can visualize the features that have positive or negative impacts on the action recognition process respectively, and obtain the specific abnormal value for further diagnosis assistance. The proposed XAI framework is expected to realize the analysis of a single abnormal sample and provide more acceptable and reliable empirical suggestions for early diagnosis and healthcare.

AB  - In this paper, we present a novel method: an explainable deep generative model-guided transfer learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for detecting pelvis fractures. Numerous research efforts are currently focused on detecting pelvic fractures using advanced intelligent processes. Although these methods have shown impressive accuracy, they frequently result in extended processing times. To address this challenge, we propose a model that integrates three key components of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to enhance the speed of fracture detection. The first component is an explainable segment that pinpoints the location of fractures. The second component is a deep generative approach that carefully analyzes images to simplify feature complexity. The final component is a convolutional neural network (CNN), which assists in decision-making by introducing four transfer learning models: InceptionV2, Xception, MobileNet, and MobileNetV2. Among these, the MobileNet-based approach demonstrates the highest accuracy in classifying conditions, achieving an accuracy of 93.43%, a precision of 99.47%, a sensitivity of 99.38%, and an F1 score of 99.42%, based on a dataset of 876 images. These results are surprising, as the model consistently performed exceptionally well in detecting pelvic fractures. This finding is significant because the model consistently showcased superior performance in identifying pelvic fractures. Moreover, the overall performance of the proposed XAI is comparable to that of medical professionals and orthopedic specialists in detecting pelvic fractures. The proposed technique may offer a promising solution to the challenges in pelvic fracture identification. It harnesses the strengths of deep generative models and CNNs to deliver accurate and interpretable results.

AB  - Even though artificial intelligence and machine learning have demonstrated remarkable performances in medical image computing, their accountability and transparency level must be improved to transfer this success into clinical practice. The reliability of machine learning decisions must be explained and interpreted, especially for supporting the medical diagnosis. For this task, the deep learning techniques' black-box nature must somehow be lightened up to clarify its promising results. Hence, we aim to investigate the impact of the ResNet-50 deep convolutional design for Barrett's esophagus and adenocarcinoma classification. For such a task, and aiming at proposing a two-step learning technique, the output of each convolutional layer that composes the ResNet-50 architecture was trained and classified for further definition of layers that would provide more impact in the architecture. We showed that local information and high-dimensional features are essential to improve the classification for our task. Besides, we observed a significant improvement when the most discriminative layers expressed more impact in the training and classification of ResNet-50 for Barrett's esophagus and adenocarcinoma classification, demonstrating that both human knowledge and computational processing may influence the correct learning of such a problem.

AB  - PurposeElectrocardiogram (ECG) is the most commonly used non-invasive diagnostic tool for cardiovascular diseases. However, its interpretation requires significant expertise, which may not be available across all medical specializations. Automated detection of heart abnormalities can assist clinicians in making accurate and efficient diagnoses. This study aims to develop an explainable machine-learning framework for classifying myocardial infarction (MI) and other heart abnormalities using ECG images.MethodsPublicly available ECG images from health centers in South Asia were used for this study. The dataset consists of four classes: Normal, Abnormal, Myocardial Infarction (MI), and Previous History of MI. The ECG images were preprocessed and transformed into time-series signals for efficient computation. These signals were then used to train an ensemble model, XGBoost, and a deep learning model, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). To enhance learning of both spatial and temporal features, we proposed CNNBoost, a Multilevel Explainable Stacked Ensemble model where CNN-extracted spatial features were concatenated with time-series data and processed by XGBoost. SHapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) were used to identify diagnostically significant ECG leads, validated by a senior cardiologist.ResultsThe proposed framework achieved 99% accuracy, 98.58% AUC, and 96.47% AUPRC, demonstrating effective MI classification. The explainability component identified critical ECG leads, reinforcing model trustworthiness.ConclusionBy integrating deep learning and ensemble learning, our approach enhances ECG classification while ensuring clinical relevance. CNNBoost's ability to learn spatial and temporal features improves interpretability and decision support. Cardiologist validation confirms its potential for real-world healthcare applications, reducing misdiagnoses and aiding clinical decision-making.

AB  - Osteoporosis is a progressive skeletal disorder characterized by decreased Bone Mineral Density (BMD) and structural deterioration, leading to an increased risk of fractures. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) and the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX), often fail to detect osteoporosis at an early stage due to their limited sensitivity and accessibility. Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Deep Learning (DL), and Machine Learning (ML) have shown significant potential in improving osteoporosis detection. However, existing models face challenges related to data privacy, explainability, computational complexity, and generalizability across diverse populations. This study introduces Federated Graph-based Multimodal Osteoporosis Diagnosis (FGMOD), a novel AI-driven framework that integrates Federated Learning (FL) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for enhanced osteoporosis risk assessment. Unlike traditional DL models that rely on centralized training, FL ensures privacy-preserving learning across multiple hospitals and institutions. Simultaneously, GNNs model trabecular bone connectivity, offering deeper insights into microarchitectural changes in osteoporotic bones. Multimodal data fusion, incorporating structured clinical data, DXA scans, and biochemical markers, significantly improves prediction accuracy and interpretability. The proposed FGMOD model was validated on a real-world dataset comprising 10 000 patient records, 5000 DXA scans, and biochemical profiles. Comparative evaluation with state-of-the-art AI models demonstrated superior performance, achieving 94.2% accuracy, 93.4% precision, 93.1% recall, and a ROC-AUC score of 0.96. Unlike CNN-based models, which rely heavily on high-resolution images, FGMOD effectively extracts clinically relevant features from graph-based bone connectivity analysis, ensuring robust and interpretable predictions. Furthermore, the use of SHAP-based feature importance analysis provides clinicians with an explainable AI decision-making process, enhancing trust in the model's recommendations. Performance comparisons against CNN, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and Transfer Learning models revealed that FGMOD outperformed all baselines, particularly in privacy-aware federated training, osteoporosis risk stratification, and real-time inference on edge AI devices. Additionally, FGMOD reduced inference latency to 45 ms per sample, making it suitable for real-time clinical deployment. FGMOD represents a significant advancement in AI-powered osteoporosis detection, addressing key challenges such as privacy, generalizability, and interpretability. Future research should focus on expanding FL collaborations across global hospitals, integrating wearable sensor data for continuous bone health monitoring, and enhancing GNN-based osteoporosis modeling for faster inference on mobile healthcare platforms. This study paves the way for clinically reliable, privacy-preserving, and scalable AI solutions in osteoporosis risk assessment and early detection.

AB  - Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition marked by difficulties in social skills, repetitive behaviours, and communication. Early and accurate diagnosis is essential for effective intervention and support. This paper proposes a secure and privacy-preserving framework for diagnosing ASD by integrating multimodal kinematic and eye movement sensory data, Deep Neural Networks (DNN), and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). Federated Learning (FL), a distributed machine learning approach, is utilized to ensure data privacy by training models across multiple devices without centralizing sensitive data. In our evaluation, we employ FL using a shallow DNN as the shared model and Federated Averaging (FedAvg) as the aggregation algorithm. We conduct experiments across two scenarios for each dataset: the first using FL with all features and the second using FL with features selected by XAI. The experiments, conducted with three clients over three rounds of training, show that the L_General dataset produces the best results, with Client 2 achieving an accuracy of 99.99% and Client 1 achieving 88%. This study underscores FL's potential to preserve privacy and security while maintaining high diagnostic accuracy, making it a viable solution for healthcare applications involving sensitive data.

AB  - Robust and rabid mortality prediction is crucial in intensive care units because it is considered one of the critical steps for treating patients with serious conditions. Combining mortality prediction with the length of stay (LoS) prediction adds another level of importance to these models. No studies in the literature predict such tasks for neonates, especially using time-series data and dynamic ensemble techniques. Dynamic ensembles are novel techniques that dynamically select the base classifiers for each new case. Medically, implementing an accurate machine learning model is insufficient to gain the trust of physicians. The model must be able to justify its decisions. While explainable AI (XAI) techniques can be used to handle this challenge, no studies have been done in this regard for neonate monitoring in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). This study utilizes advanced machine learning approaches to predict mortality and LoS through data-driven learning. We propose a multilayer dynamic ensemble-based model to predict mortality as a classification task and LoS as a regression task for neonates admitted to the NICU. The model has been built based on the patient's time-series data of the first 24 h in the NICU. We utilized a cohort of 3,133 infants from the MIMIC-III real dataset to build and optimize the selected algorithms. It has shown that the dynamic ensemble models achieved better results than other classi-fiers, and static ensemble regressors achieved better results than classical machine learning regressors. The proposed optimized model is supported by three well-known explainability techniques of SHAP, decision tree visualization, and rule-based system. To provide online assistance to physicians in monitoring and managing neonates in the NICU, we implemented a web-based clinical decision support system based on the most accurate models and selected XAI techniques. The code of the proposed models is publicly available at https://github. com/InfoLab-SKKU/neonateMortalityPrediction.

AB  - Deep learning (DL) has dramatically pushed the previous limits of various tasks, ranging from computer vision to natural language processing. Despite its success, the lack of model explanations thwarts the usage of these techniques in life-critical domains, e.g., medical diagnosis and self-driving systems. To date, the core technology to solve the explainable issue is explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). XAI methods have been developed to produce human-understandable explanations by leveraging intermediate results of the DL models, e.g., gradients and model parameters. While the effectiveness of XAI methods has been demonstrated in benign environments, their privacy against model extraction attacks (i.e., attacks at the model confidentially) requires to be studied. To this end, this paper proposes DMEAE, a data-free model extraction attack using explanation-guided, to explore XAI privacy threats. Compared with previous works, DMEAE does not require collecting any data and utilizes model explanation loss. Specifically, DMEAE creates synthetic data using a generative model with model explanation loss items. Extensive evaluations verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed attack strategy on SVHN and CIFAR-10 datasets. We hope that our research can provide insights for the development of practical tools to trade off the relationship between privacy and model explanations.

AB  - Background: Multivariable analyses (MVA) and machine learning (ML) applied on large datasets may have a high potential to provide clinical decision support in neuro-otology and reveal further avenues for vestibular research. To this end, we build base-ml, a comprehensive MVA/ML software tool, and applied it to three increasingly difficult clinical objectives in differentiation of common vestibular disorders, using data from a large prospective clinical patient registry (DizzyReg).
   Methods: Base-ml features a full MVA/ML pipeline for classification of multimodal patient data, comprising tools for data loading and pre-processing; a stringent scheme for nested and stratified cross-validation including hyper-parameter optimization; a set of 11 classifiers, ranging from commonly used algorithms like logistic regression and random forests, to artificial neural network models, including a graph-based deep learning model which we recently proposed; a multi-faceted evaluation of classification metrics; tools from the domain of "Explainable AI " that illustrate the input distribution and a statistical analysis of the most important features identified by multiple classifiers.
   Results: In the first clinical task, classification of the bilateral vestibular failure (N = 66) vs. functional dizziness (N = 346) was possible with a classification accuracy ranging up to 92.5% (Random Forest). In the second task, primary functional dizziness (N = 151) vs. secondary functional dizziness (following an organic vestibular syndrome) (N = 204), was classifiable with an accuracy ranging from 56.5 to 64.2% (k-nearest neighbors/logistic regression). The third task compared four episodic disorders, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (N = 134), vestibular paroxysmia (N = 49), Meniere disease (N = 142) and vestibular migraine (N = 215). Classification accuracy ranged between 25.9 and 50.4% (Naive Bayes/Support Vector Machine). Recent (graph-) deep learning models classified well in all three tasks, but not significantly better than more traditional ML methods. Classifiers reliably identified clinically relevant features as most important toward classification.
   Conclusion: The three clinical tasks yielded classification results that correlate with the clinical intuition regarding the difficulty of diagnosis. It is favorable to apply an array of MVA/ML algorithms rather than a single one, to avoid under-estimation of classification accuracy. Base-ml provides a systematic benchmarking of classifiers, with a standardized output of MVA/ML performance on clinical tasks. To alleviate re-implementation efforts, we provide base-ml as an open-source tool for the community.

AB  - This study introduces a novel 2-level meta-heuristic adaptive watershed approach (AWT) for lung cancer segmentation and classification using an optimised convolutional deep neural network (OCDNN) to enhance early detection and classification accuracy. The preprocessing stage includes image augmentation (IA), image normalization (IN), grey scale conversion (GSC), and contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE). For accurate segmentation, the Self-Adaptive Atomic Orbital Search (SA-AOS) method and Archimedes Optimization method (AOAO) are utilized. Features are extracted using Speed Up Robust Feature (SURF), Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), and standard deviations. The OCDNN, optimized with a three-tier classification system, performs classification. Visualization is supported by the LIME technique. The proposed model, implemented in Python, demonstrates high accuracy in segmenting and classifying lung cancer. Experimental findings show a learning rate of 70% produces the best accuracy of 99.76%, while a learning rate of 80% yields 99.08%. The study advances lung cancer treatment methods, aiding medical professionals in making better-informed healthcare decisions. This research presents a cutting-edge approach to lung cancer detection, emphasizing the importance of precise segmentation and classification for improving patient outcomes.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic wreaks havoc on healthcare systems all across the world. In pandemic scenarios like COVID-19, the applicability of diagnostic modalities is crucial in medical diagnosis, where non-invasive ultrasound imaging has the potential to be a useful biomarker. This research develops a computer-assisted intelligent methodology for ultrasound lung image classification by utilizing a fuzzy pooling-based convolutional neural network FP-CNN with underlying evidence of particular decisions. The fuzzy-pooling method finds better representative features for ultrasound image classification. The FPCNN model categorizes ultrasound images into one of three classes: covid, disease-free (normal), and pneumonia. Explanations of diagnostic decisions are crucial to ensure the fairness of an intelligent system. This research has used Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) to explain the prediction of the FP-CNN models. The prediction of the black-box model is illustrated using the SHAP explanation of the intermediate layers of the black-box model. To determine the most effective model, we have tested different state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architectures with various training strategies, including fine-tuned models, single-layer fuzzy pooling models, and fuzzy pooling at all pooling layers. Among different architectures, the Xception model with all pooling layers having fuzzy pooling achieves the best classification results of 97.2% accuracy. We hope our proposed method will be helpful for the clinical diagnosis of covid-19 from lung ultrasound (LUS) images.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is a broad term referring to the application of computational algorithms that can analyze large data sets to classify, predict, or gain useful conclusions. Under the umbrella of AI is machine learning (ML). ML is the process of building or learning statistical models using previously observed real world data to predict outcomes, or categorize observations based on 'training' provided by humans. These predictions are then applied to future data, all the while folding in the new data into its perpetually improving and calibrated statistical model. The future of AI and ML in healthcare research is exciting and expansive. AI and ML are becoming cornerstones in the medical and healthcare-research domains and are integral in our continued processing and capitalization of robust patient EMR data. Considerations for the use and application of ML in healthcare settings include assessing the quality of data inputs and decision-making that serve as the foundations of the ML model, ensuring the end-product is interpretable, transparent, and ethical concerns are considered throughout the development process. The current and future applications of ML include improving the quality and quantity of data collected from EMRs to improve registry data, utilizing these robust datasets to improve and standardized research protocols and outcomes, clinical decision-making applications, natural language processing and improving the fundamentals of value-based care, to name only a few.

AB  - Background and Objective: Exposure to solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation can cause malignant keratinocyte cancer and eye disease. Developing a user-friendly, portable, real-time solar UV alert system especially or wearable electronic mobile devices can help reduce the exposure to UV as a key measure for personal and occupational management of the UV risks. This research aims to design artificial intelligence-inspired early warning tool tailored for short-term forecasting of UV index (UVI) integrating satellite-derived and ground-based predictors for Australian hotspots receiving high UV exposures. The study further improves the trustworthiness of the newly designed tool using an explainable artificial intelligence approach. Methods: An enhanced joint hybrid explainable deep neural network model (called EJH-X-DNN) is constructed involving two phases of feature selection and hyperparameter tuning using Bayesian optimization. A compre-hensive assessment of EJH-X-DNN is conducted with six other competing benchmarked models. The proposed model is explained locally and globally using robust model-agnostic explainable artificial intelligence frame-works such as Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), Shapley additive explanations (SHAP), and permutation feature importance (PFI). Results: The newly proposed model outperformed all benchmarked models for forecasting hourly horizons UVI, with correlation coefficients of 0.900, 0.960, 0.897, and 0.913, respectively, for Darwin, Alice Springs, Townsville, and Emerald hotspots. According to the combined local and global explainable model outcomes, the site-based results indicate that antecedent lagged memory of UVI and solar zenith angle are influential features. Predictions made by EJH-X-DNN model are strongly influenced by factors such as ozone effect, cloud conditions, and precipitation.Conclusion: With its superiority and skillful interpretation, the UVI prediction system reaffirms its benefits for providing real-time UV alerts to mitigate risks of skin and eye health complications, reducing healthcare costs and contributing to outdoor exposure policy.

AB  - Early Alzheimer's disease detection is essential for facilitating prompt intervention and enhancing the quality of care provided to patients. This research presents a novel strategy for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease that makes use of sophisticated sampling methods in conjunction with a hybrid model of deep learning. We use stratified sampling, ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling), and Cluster- Centroids approaches to ensure a balanced representation of Alzheimer's and non-Alzheimer's cases during model training in order to meet the issues posed by imbalanced data distributions in clinical datasets. This allows us to solve the challenges posed by imbalanced data distributions in clinical datasets. A strong hybrid architecture is constructed by combining a Residual Neural Network (ResNet) with Residual Neural Network (ResNet) units. This architecture makes the most of both the feature extraction capabilities of ResNet and the capacity of LSTM to capture temporal dependencies. The findings demonstrate that the model is superior to traditional approaches to machine learning and single-model architectures in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The hybrid deep learning model demonstrates exceptional capabilities in identifying early indicators of Alzheimer's disease with a high degree of accuracy, which paves the way for early diagnosis and treatment. In addition, an interpretability study is carried out in order to provide light on the decision-making process underlying the model. This helps to contribute to a better understanding of the characteristics and biomarkers that play a role in the identification of Alzheimer's disease. In general, the strategy that was provided provides a promising foundation for accurate and reliable Alzheimer's disease identification. It does this by harnessing the capabilities of hybrid deep learning models and sophisticated sampling approaches to improve clinical decision support and, as a result, eventually improve patient outcomes.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize healthcare by automating the detection and classification of events and anomalies. In the scope of this work, events and anomalies are abnormalities in the patient's data, where the former are due to a medical condition, such as a seizure or a fall, and the latter are erroneous data due to faults or malicious attacks. AI-based event and anomaly detection (EAD) and their classification can improve patient outcomes by identifying problems earlier, enabling more timely interventions while minimizing false alarms caused by anomalies. Moreover, the advancement of Medical Internet of Things (MIoT), or wearable devices, and their high processing capabilities facilitated the gathering, AI-based processing, and transmission of data, which enabled remote patient monitoring, and personalized and predictive healthcare. However, it is fundamental in healthcare to ensure the explainability of AI systems, meaning that they can provide understandable and transparent reasoning for their decisions. This article proposes an online EAD approach using a lightweight autoencoder (AE) on the MIoT. The detected abnormality is explained using KernelSHAP, an explainable AI (XAI) technique, where the explanation of the abnormality is used, by an artificial neural network (ANN), to classify it into an event or anomaly. Intensive simulations are conducted using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) data set for various physiological data. Results showed the robustness of the proposed approach in the detection and classification of events, regardless of the percentage of the present anomalies.

AB  - Electronic health records (EHRs) are a valuable source of information that can aid in understanding a patient's health condition and making informed healthcare decisions. However, modelling longitudinal EHRs with heterogeneous information is a challenging task. Although recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are frequently utilized in artificial intelligence (AI) models for capturing longitudinal data, their explanatory capabilities are limited. Predictive clustering stands as the most recent advancement within this domain, offering interpretable indications at the cluster level for predicting disease risk. Nonetheless, the challenge of determining the optimal number of clusters has put a brake on the widespread application of predictive clustering for disease risk prediction. In this paper, we introduce a novel non-parametric predictive clustering-based risk prediction model that integrates the Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (DPMM) with predictive clustering via neural networks. To enhance the model's interpretability, we integrate attention mechanisms that enable the capture of local level evidence in addition to the cluster-level evidence provided by predictive clustering. The outcome of this research is the development of a multi-level explainable artificial intelligence (AI) model. We evaluated the proposed model on two real-world datasets and demonstrated its effectiveness in capturing longitudinal EHR information for disease risk prediction. Moreover, the model successfully produced interpretable evidence bolster its predictions.

AB  - Incorporating Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents significant potential for transforming multiple aspects of the healthcare sector, encompassing administration, medical prediction, decision-making, and diagnostics. However, its often perceived enigmatic nature is a significant barrier to the widespread use of AI in the medical field. AI systems, specifically deep learning models, have demonstrated exceptional performance, often comparable to that of humans. However, their internal mechanisms sometimes resemble opaque entities, leading to challenges in understanding and placing trust in their decision-making processes. The presence of skepticism has limited their practical application in medical contexts. Given the challenges above, a pioneering proposed scheme, namely "DXAIB", has been introduced. The proposed scheme utilizes a hybrid methodology that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with the Random Forest (RF) model to detect breast cancer accurately. One distinguishing characteristic of "DXAIB" is its distinctive focus on interpretability of the predictions. The RF technique, employed to predict class labels, implements an automated feature learning process facilitated by the "DXAIB" scheme, which has several convolutional layers. However, "DXAIB" doesn't stop at providing accurate predictions. To tackle the significant concern surrounding the interpretability of AI, an approach called "SHAP" is utilized to offer explanations at both the local and global levels for every prediction. This implies that "DXAIB" not only facilitates the identification of a diagnosis but also provides comprehensive explanations regarding the rationale behind a specific prediction, augmenting transparency and fostering confidence in the decision-making process of the AI system. The proposed "DXAIB" scheme surpasses other cutting-edge schemes in terms of the prediction outcomes it achieves and, therefore, in terms of its explainability findings.

AB  - Objective Artificial intelligence (AI) models trained using medical images for clinical tasks often exhibit bias in the form of subgroup performance disparities. However, since not all sources of bias in real-world medical imaging data are easily identifiable, it is challenging to comprehensively assess their impacts. In this article, we introduce an analysis framework for systematically and objectively investigating the impact of biases in medical images on AI models.Materials and Methods Our framework utilizes synthetic neuroimages with known disease effects and sources of bias. We evaluated the impact of bias effects and the efficacy of 3 bias mitigation strategies in counterfactual data scenarios on a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier.Results The analysis revealed that training a CNN model on the datasets containing bias effects resulted in expected subgroup performance disparities. Moreover, reweighing was the most successful bias mitigation strategy for this setup. Finally, we demonstrated that explainable AI methods can aid in investigating the manifestation of bias in the model using this framework.Discussion The value of this framework is showcased in our findings on the impact of bias scenarios and efficacy of bias mitigation in a deep learning model pipeline. This systematic analysis can be easily expanded to conduct further controlled in silico trials in other investigations of bias in medical imaging AI.Conclusion Our novel methodology for objectively studying bias in medical imaging AI can help support the development of clinical decision-support tools that are robust and responsible.

AB  - Brain tumour classification plays a significant role in improving patient care, treatment planning, and enhancing the overall healthcare system's effectiveness. This article presents a ResNet framework optimized using Henry gas solubility optimization (HGSO) for the classification of brain tumours, resulting in improved classification performance in magnetic resonance images (MRI). Two variants of the deep residual neural network, namely ResNet-18 and ResNet-50, are trained on the MRI training dataset. The four critical hyperparameters of the ResNet model: momentum, initial learning rate, maximum epochs, and validation frequency are tuned to obtain optimal values using HGSO algorithm. Subsequently, the optimized ResNet model is evaluated using two separate databases: Database1, comprising four tumour classes, and Database2, with three tumour classes. The performance is assessed using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F-score. The highest classification accuracy of 0.9825 is attained using the proposed optimized ResNet-50 framework on Database1. Moreover, the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (GRAD-CAM) algorithm is utilized to enhance the understanding of deep neural networks by highlighting the regions that are influential in making a particular classification decision. Grad-CAM heatmaps confirm the model focuses on relevant tumour features, not image artefacts. This research enhances MRI brain tumour classification via deep learning optimization strategies.

AB  - BackgroundAdvancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have revolutionized the medical field and transformed translational medicine. These technologies enable more accurate disease trajectory models while enhancing patient-centered care. However, challenges such as heterogeneous datasets, class imbalance, and scalability remain barriers to achieving optimal predictive performance.MethodsThis study proposes a novel AI-based framework that integrates Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) to address these challenges. The framework was evaluated using two distinct datasets: MIMIC-IV, a critical care database containing clinical data of critically ill patients, and the UK Biobank, which comprises genetic, clinical, and lifestyle data from 500,000 participants. Key performance metrics, including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUROC, were used to assess the framework against traditional and advanced ML models.ResultsThe proposed framework demonstrated superior performance compared to classical models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks. For example, on the UK Biobank dataset, the model achieved an AUROC of 0.96, significantly outperforming Neural Networks (0.92). The framework was also efficient, requiring only 32.4 s for training on MIMIC-IV, with low prediction latency, making it suitable for real-time applications.ConclusionsThe proposed AI-based framework effectively addresses critical challenges in translational medicine, offering superior predictive accuracy and efficiency. Its robust performance across diverse datasets highlights its potential for integration into real-time clinical decision support systems, facilitating personalized medicine and improving patient outcomes. Future research will focus on enhancing scalability and interpretability for broader clinical applications.

AB  - Background Inflammatory Bowel Diseases with its complexity and heterogeneity could benefit from the increased application of Artificial Intelligence in clinical management. Aim To accurately predict adverse outcomes in patients with IBD using advanced computational models in a nationally representative dataset for potential use in clinical practice. Methods We built a training model cohort and validated our result in a separate cohort. We used LASSO and Ridge regressions, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests and Neural Networks to balance between complexity and interpretability and analyzed their relative performances and reported the strongest predictors to the respective models. The participants in our study were patients with IBD selected from The OptumLabs (R) Data Warehouse (OLDW), a longitudinal, real-world data asset with de-identified administrative claims and electronic health record (EHR) data. Results We included 72,178 and 69,165 patients in the training and validation set, respectively. In total, 4.1% of patients in the validation set were hospitalized, 2.9% needed IBD-related surgeries, 17% used long-term steroids and 13% of patients were initiated with biological therapy. Of the AI models we tested, the Random Forest and LASSO resulted in high accuracies (AUCs 0.70-0.92). Our artificial neural network performed similarly well in most of the models (AUCs 0.61-0.90). Conclusions This study demonstrates feasibility of accurately predicting adverse outcomes using complex and novel AI models on large longitudinal data sets of patients with IBD. These models could be applied for risk stratification and implementation of preemptive measures to avoid adverse outcomes in a clinical setting.

AB  - Medical Internet of Things (IoT) devices are becoming more and more common in healthcare. This has created a huge need for advanced predictive health modeling strategies that can make good use of the growing amount of multimodal data to find potential health risks early and help individuals in a personalized way. Existing methods, while useful, have limitations in predictive accuracy, delay, personalization, and user interpretability, requiring a more comprehensive and efficient approach to harness modern medical IoT devices. MAIPFE is a multimodal approach integrating pre-emptive analysis, personalized feature selection, and explainable AI for real-time health monitoring and disease detection. By using AI for early disease detection, personalized health recommendations, and transparency, healthcare will be transformed. The Multimodal Approach Integrating Pre-emptive Analysis, Personalized Feature Selection, and Explainable AI (MAIPFE) framework, which combines Firefly Optimizer, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Fuzzy C Means (FCM), and Explainable AI, improves disease detection precision over existing methods. Comprehensive metrics show the model's superiority in real-time health analysis. The proposed framework outperformed existing models by 8.3% in disease detection classification precision, 8.5% in accuracy, 5.5% in recall, 2.9% in specificity, 4.5% in AUC (Area Under the Curve), and 4.9% in delay reduction. Disease prediction precision increased by 4.5%, accuracy by 3.9%, recall by 2.5%, specificity by 3.5%, AUC by 1.9%, and delay levels decreased by 9.4%. MAIPFE can revolutionize healthcare with preemptive analysis, personalized health insights, and actionable recommendations. The research shows that this innovative approach improves patient outcomes and healthcare efficiency in the real world.

AB  - Machine learning, artificial intelligence, and other modern statistical methods are providing new opportunities to operationalise previously untapped and rapidly growing sources of data for patient benefit. Despite much promising research currently being undertaken, particularly in imaging, the literature as a whole lacks transparency, clear reporting to facilitate replicability, exploration for potential ethical concerns, and clear demonstrations of effectiveness. Among the many reasons why these problems exist, one of the most important (for which we provide a preliminary solution here) is the current lack of best practice guidance specific to machine learning and artificial intelligence. However, we believe that interdisciplinary groups pursuing research and impact projects involving machine learning and artificial intelligence for health would benefit from explicitly addressing a series of questions concerning transparency, reproducibility, ethics, and effectiveness (TREE). The 20 critical questions proposed here provide a framework for research groups to inform the design, conduct, and reporting; for editors and peer reviewers to evaluate contributions to the literature; and for patients, clinicians and policy makers to critically appraise where new findings may deliver patient benefit.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques of deep learning have revolutionized the disease diagnosis with their outstanding image classification performance. In spite of the outstanding results, the widespread adoption of these techniques in clinical practice is still taking place at a moderate pace. One of the major hindrance is that a trained Deep Neural Networks (DNN) model provides a prediction, but questions about why and how that prediction was made remain unanswered. This linkage is of utmost importance for the regulated healthcare domain to increase the trust in the automated diagnosis system by the practitioners, patients and other stake-holders. The application of deep learning for medical imaging has to be interpreted with caution due to the health and safety concerns similar to blame attribution in the case of an accident involving autonomous cars. The consequences of both a false positive and false negative cases are far reaching for patients' welfare and cannot be ignored. This is exacerbated by the fact that the state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms comprise of complex interconnected structures, millions of parameters, and a 'black box' nature, offering little understanding of their inner working unlike the traditional machine learning algorithms. Explainable AI (XAI) techniques help to un-derstand model predictions which help develop trust in the system, accelerate the disease diagnosis, and meet adherence to regulatory requirements.This survey provides a comprehensive review of the promising field of XAI for biomedical imaging diagnostics. We also provide a categorization of the XAI techniques, discuss the open challenges, and provide future di-rections for XAI which would be of interest to clinicians, regulators and model developers.

AB  - The sounds made by the heart are regularly used to determine the mechanics and status of blood flow within the heart. While machine-learning algorithms have been presented to classify different heart conditions via auscultation, these models typically output a single-label decision and offer little insight into the magnitude or severity of the classified condition. The inner workings of these networks are a 'black box', offering a diagnosis prediction without a metric for explaining how the conclusion was drawn. Here, we present a novel approach, combining deep convolutional neural networks and explainable AI algorithms, to extract key temporal signatures in recordings of multiple heart conditions to enable multi-label classification and severity determination. Signatures found are supported by previous research and offer more information than a simple single-label classification algorithm. The neural networks are able to reach a multi-label classification accuracy of up to 78% (alongside 98% single-label accuracy) after being trained solely on single-label data. This approach may assist physicians in making quick, accurate, and comprehensive diagnoses and provide new insights for the progress of multi-label machine learning for medical diagnosis.

AB  - Sepsis is a severe and potentially life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's immune response becomes excessively intense in reaction to an infection. If not promptly treated, it can result in organ failure and even death. So, early identification of patients at risk for sepsis is crucial to improve the patient's outcome in critical care. The main objective of this work is to create a highly accurate model named XAutoNet that utilizes optimal number of clinical features to predict sepsis 6 h before its onset, also providing diagnostic map behind its prediction that will help health workers in better treatment. The importance of this work is heightened in resource-scarce settings, where not all tests are available, or the turnaround time is excessive. A novel convolutional neural network based autoencoder architecture is also implemented to augment the performance of XAutoNet by reducing the input dimensions into an optimal number of dimensions. For explaining the participation of features in feature extraction, Gradient-based Class Activation Map is used to visualize the gradients in individual layers of the encoder block via heatmaps. For the explainability of XAutoNet, a visualization tool named SHapley Additive exPlanations (is used to interpret the features' contribution in the model's global and local prediction. The proposed XAutoNet model has an accuracy of 93%, Precision of 90%, F1 score of 92%, and Recall of 94%. The performance of the convolutional neural network -based autoencoder was also compared with its other variants, including Principal Component Analysis, which showed its high feature extraction power. The XAutoNet has also outperformed other comparable method by a significant margin. The performance of XAutoNet is instrumental in predicting sepsis in advance by understanding the non-linearity and complexity of the data of Intensive Care Unit patients with the help of the proposed autoencoder.

AB  - Schizophrenia is an example of a rare mental disorder that is challenging to diagnose using conventional methods. Deep learning methods have been extensively employed to aid in the diagnosis of schizophrenia. However, their efficacy relies heavily on data quantity, and their black-box nature raises trust concerns, especially in medical diagnosis contexts. In this study, we leverage a deep learning-based method for the automatic diagnosis of schizophrenia using EEG brain recordings. This approach utilizes generative data augmentation, a powerful technique that enhances the accuracy of the diagnosis. Additionally, our study provides a framework to use when dealing with the challenge of limited training data for the diagnosis of other potential rare mental disorders. To enable the utilization of time-frequency features, spectrograms were extracted from the raw signals. After exploring several neural network architectural setups, a proper convolutional neural network (CNN) was used for the initial diagnosis. Subsequently, using Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) and Variational Autoencoder (VAE), two different synthetic datasets were generated in order to augment the initial dataset and address the over-fitting issue. The augmented dataset using VAE achieved a 3.0% improvement in accuracy, reaching 99.0%, and also demonstrated faster convergence. Finally, we addressed the lack of trust in black-box models using the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) algorithm to determine the most important superpixels (frequencies) in the diagnosis process.

AB  - Skin cancer is a prevalent form of malignancy globally, and its early and accurate diagnosis is critical for patient survival. Clinical evaluation of skin lesions is essential, but it faces challenges such as long waiting times and subjective interpretations. Deep learning techniques have been developed to tackle these challenges and assist dermatologists in making more accurate diagnoses. Prompt treatment of skin cancer is vital to prevent its progression and potentially life-threatening consequences. The use of deep learning algorithms can improve the speed and accuracy of diagnosis, leading to earlier detection and treatment. Additionally, it can reduce the workload for healthcare professionals, allowing them to concentrate on more complex cases. The goal of this study was to develop reliable deep learning (DL) prediction models for skin cancer classification; (i) deal with a typical severe class imbalance problem, which arises because the skin-affected patients' class is significantly smaller than the healthy class; and (ii) interpret the model output to better understand the decision-making mechanism (iii) Propose an End-to-End smart healthcare system through an android application. In a comparison examination with six well-known classifiers, the effectiveness of the proposed DL technique was explored in terms of metrics relating to both generalization capability and classification accuracy. A study used the HAM10000 dataset and an optimized CNN to identify the seven forms of skin cancer. The model was trained using two optimization functions (Adam and RMSprop) and three activation functions (Relu, Swish, and Tanh). Furthermore, an XAI-based skin lesion classification system was developed, incorporating Grad-CAM and Grad-CAM++ to explain the model's decisions. This system can help doctors make informed skin cancer diagnoses in their early stages, with an 82% classification accuracy and 0.47% loss accuracy.

AB  - Motivation Electronic health records (EHRs) represent a comprehensive resource of a patient's medical history. EHRs are essential for utilizing advanced technologies such as deep learning (DL), enabling healthcare providers to analyze extensive data, extract valuable insights, and make precise and data-driven clinical decisions. DL methods such as recurrent neural networks (RNN) have been utilized to analyze EHR to model disease progression and predict diagnosis. However, these methods do not address some inherent irregularities in EHR data such as irregular time intervals between clinical visits. Furthermore, most DL models are not interpretable. In this study, we propose two interpretable DL architectures based on RNN, namely time-aware RNN (TA-RNN) and TA-RNN-autoencoder (TA-RNN-AE) to predict patient's clinical outcome in EHR at the next visit and multiple visits ahead, respectively. To mitigate the impact of irregular time intervals, we propose incorporating time embedding of the elapsed times between visits. For interpretability, we propose employing a dual-level attention mechanism that operates between visits and features within each visit.Results The results of the experiments conducted on Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) datasets indicated the superior performance of proposed models for predicting Alzheimer's Disease (AD) compared to state-of-the-art and baseline approaches based on F2 and sensitivity. Additionally, TA-RNN showed superior performance on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) dataset for mortality prediction. In our ablation study, we observed enhanced predictive performance by incorporating time embedding and attention mechanisms. Finally, investigating attention weights helped identify influential visits and features in predictions.Availability and implementation https://github.com/bozdaglab/TA-RNN.

AB  - Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a prevalent and serious complication of diabetes, often leading to severe morbidity and even amputations if not timely diagnosed and managed. The increasing prevalence of DFUs poses a significant challenge to healthcare systems worldwide. Accurate and timely classification of DFUs is crucial for effective treatment and prevention of complications. In this paper, we present "DFootNet", an innovative and comprehensive classification framework for the accurate assessment of diabetic foot ulcers using a dense neural network architecture. Our proposed approach leverages the power of deep learning to automatically extract relevant features from diverse clinical DFU images. The proposed model comprises a multi-layered dense neural network designed to handle the intricate patterns and variations present in different stages and types of DFUs. The network architecture integrates convolutional and fully connected layers, allowing for hierarchical feature extraction and robust feature representation. To evaluate the efficacy of DFootNet, we conducted experiments on a large and diverse dataset of diabetic foot ulcers. Our results demonstrate that DFootNet achieves a remarkable accuracy of 98.87%, precision-99.01%, recall-98.73%, F1-score as 98.86%, and AUC-ROC as 98.13%, outperforming existing methods in distinguishing between ulcer and non-ulcer images. Moreover, our framework provides insights into the decision-making process, offering transparency and interpretability through attention mechanisms that highlight important regions within ulcer images. We also present a comparative analysis of DFootNet's performance against other popular deep learning models, showcasing its robustness and adaptability across various scenarios.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are still one of the leading causes of death globally, underscoring the importance of early and right risk prediction for effective preventive measures and therapeutic approaches. This study proposes an innovative hybrid ensemble learning framework that combines state-of-the-art machine learning models and explainable AI approaches to risk prediction for cardiovascular disease. Using a range of publicly accessible datasets, the suggested structure incorporates Gradient Boosting, CatBoost, and Neural Networks using a stacked ensemble architecture, resulting in more robust predictive performance than the constituent models. This is particularly interesting when visualised through techniques such as SHAP values, t-SNE and PCA projections which allows the study to explore the multidimensional aspects of the relationships between key risk factors including systolic/diastolic blood pressure, BMI, cholesterol-glucose ratio, alongside various lifestyle parameters. They build further on model interpretability through explainable AI methods so that clinicians can observe the involvement of each feature in generating the predictions. The hybrid model demonstrated strong predictive performance with an AUC-ROC score of 0.82, and confusion matrices showing a well-balanced classification of both positive and negative cases - achieving Precision: 81%, Recall: 83%, and F1-Score: 82% on the test dataset. The results highlight the potential of ensemble learning for addressing complex medical prediction problems and the need for models to be interpretable to ensure the trustworthiness of AI systems in healthcare settings. These findings provide an exciting opportunity toward better models of CVD risk prediction, potentially providing healthcare stakeholders with interpretable means to target treatments.

AB  - There is a growing trend of using artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning algorithms, in medical diagnostics, revolutionizing healthcare by improving efficiency, accuracy, and patient outcomes. However, the use of artificial intelligence in medical diagnostics comes with the critical need to explain the reasoning behind artificial intelligence-based predictions and ensure transparency in decision-making. Explainable artificial intelligence has emerged as a crucial research area to address the need for transparency and interpretability in medical diagnostics. Explainable artificial intelligence techniques aim to provide insights into the decision-making process of artificial intelligence systems, enabling clinicians to understand the factors the algorithms consider in reaching their predictions. This paper presents a detailed review of saliency-based (visual) methods, such as class activation methods, which have gained popularity in medical imaging as they provide visual explanations by highlighting the regions of an image most influential in the artificial intelligence's decision. We also present the literature on non-visual methods, but the focus will be on visual methods. We also use the existing literature to experiment with infrared breast images for detecting breast cancer. Towards the end of this paper, we also propose an "attention guided Grad-CAM" that enhances the visualizations for explainable artificial intelligence. The existing literature shows that explainable artificial intelligence techniques are not explored in the context of infrared medical images and opens up a wide range of opportunities for further research to make clinical thermography into assistive technology for the medical community.

AB  - Gastrointestinal (GI) diseases are prevalent medical conditions that require accurate and timely diagnosis for effective treatment. To address this, we developed the MultiFusion Convolutional Neural Network (MF-CNN), a deep learning framework that strategically integrates and adapts elements from six deep learning models, enhancing feature extraction and classi fi cation of GI diseases from endoscopic images. The MF-CNN architecture leverages truncated and partially frozen layers from existing models, augmented with novel components such as Auxiliary Fusing Layers (AuxFL), Fusion Residual Block (FuRB), and Alpha Dropouts ( alpha DO) to improve precision and robustness. This design facilitates the precise identi fi cation of conditions such as ulcerative colitis, polyps, esophagitis, and healthy colons. Our methodology involved preprocessing endoscopic images sourced from open databases, including KVASIR and ETIS-Larib Polyp DB, using adaptive histogram equalization (AHE) to enhance their quality. The MF-CNN framework supports detailed feature mapping for improved interpretability of the model ' s internal workings. An ablation study was conducted to validate the contribution of each component, demonstrating that the integration of AuxFL, alpha DO, and FuRB played a crucial part in reducing over fi tting and ef fi ciency saturation and enhancing overall model performance. The MF-CNN demonstrated outstanding performance in terms of ef fi cacy, achieving an accuracy rate of 99.25%. It also excelled in other key performance metrics with a precision of 99.27%, a recall of 99.25%, and an F1 -score of 99.25%. These metrics con fi rmed the model ' s pro fi ciency in accurate classi fi cation and its capability to minimize false positives and negatives across all tested GI disease categories. Furthermore, the AUC values were exceptional, averaging 1.00 for both test and validation sets, indicating perfect discriminative ability. The fi ndings of the P -R curve analysis and confusion matrix further con fi rmed the robust classi fi cation performance of the MF-CNN. This research introduces a technique for medical imaging that can potentially transform diagnostics in gastrointestinal healthcare facilities worldwide.

AB  - Aims/Background Cervical cancer continues to be a significant cause of cancer-related deaths among women, especially in low-resource settings where screening and follow-up care are lacking. The transcription factor zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2) has been identified as a potential marker for tumour aggressiveness and cancer progression in cervical cancer tissues.
   Methods This study presents a hybrid deep learning system developed to classify cervical cancer images based on ZEB2 expression. The system integrates multiple convolutional neural network models-EfficientNet, DenseNet, and InceptionNet-using ensemble voting. We utilised the gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) visualisation technique to improve the interpretability of the decisions made by the convolutional neural networks. The dataset consisted of 649 annotated images, which were divided into training, validation, and testing sets.
   Results The hybrid model exhibited a high classification accuracy of 94.4% on the test set. The Grad-CAM visualisations offered insights into the model's decision-making process, emphasising the image regions crucial for classifying ZEB2 expression levels.
   Conclusion The proposed hybrid deep learning model presents an effective and interpretable method for the classification of cervical cancer based on ZEB2 expression. This approach holds the potential to substantially aid in early diagnosis, thereby potentially enhancing patient outcomes and mitigating healthcare costs. Future endeavours will concentrate on enhancing the model's accuracy and investigating its applicability to other cancer types.

AB  - Background: Career fulfilment among medical doctors is crucial for job satisfaction, retention, and healthcare quality, especially in developing nations with challenging healthcare systems. Traditional career guidance methods struggle to address the complexities of career fulfilment. While recent advancements in machine learning, particularly Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models, offer promising solutions for personalized career predictions, their applicability, interpretability, and impact remain challenging. Method: This study explores the applicability, explainability, and implications of ANN models in predicting career fulfillment among medical doctors in developing nations, considering socio-economic, psychological, and professional factors. Box plots visualized data distribution, while Heatmaps assessed data intensity and relationships. Matthew's correlation coefficient and Taylor's chart were used to evaluate model performance. Input feature contributions to ANN predictions were analyzed using permutation importance, SHAP, LIME, and Williams plots. The model was tested on a dataset tailored to medical professionals in Nigeria and China, with evaluation metrics including Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error, and R-2 Score. Results: The ANN model demonstrates strong predictive accuracy, capturing relationships between input factors and outcomes. For Chinese doctors, it achieved an MSE of 0.0004 and R-2 of 0.9994, while for Nigerian doctors, it recorded an MSE of 0.0003 and R-2 of 0.9998. Key factors for Chinese doctors' satisfaction were IF1 and IF2, while EF1 and EF3 were crucial in preventing dissatisfaction. For Nigerian doctors, IF2 and IF3 drove satisfaction, while EF1 and EF4 were significant in avoiding dissatisfaction. Conclusion: The results highlights the ANN model's effectiveness in predicting career fulfillment among medical doctors in developing nations, offering a valuable tool for career guidance, policymaking, and improving job satisfaction, retention, and healthcare quality.

AB  - Healthcare fraud is a critical challenge, contributing significantly to rising healthcare costs and financial losses. This article proposes a hybrid architecture for healthcare fraud detection, combining deep learning-based feature representation with gradient boosting classification and explainable AI techniques. The framework integrates convolutional neural networks (CNNs), transformers, and XGBoost to capture intricate patterns in claims data while maintaining interpretability through Shapley additive explanations. The model we proposed was tested on two datasets: the Medicare Provider Fraud dataset and the Healthcare Providers dataset. On the Medicare dataset, the framework achieved an F1-score of 0.95 on the training set and 0.92 on the test set, with an AUC-ROC of 0.98 and 0.97, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art models such as LightGBM and CatBoost. On the Healthcare Providers dataset, the framework attained a test F1-score of 0.92 and an AUC-ROC of 0.96, consistently surpassing traditional models like Support Vector Machines and Random Forest. Key contributions include integrating domain-specific features, such as provider-patient interaction graphs and temporal patterns, and using explainability techniques to enhance trustworthiness.

AB  - Background and objective: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity problem (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopment problem in children and adolescents that can lead to long-term challenges in life outcomes if left untreated. Also, ADHD is frequently associated with Conduct Disorder (CD), and multiple research have found similarities in clinical signs and behavioral symptoms between both diseases, making differentiation between ADHD, ADHD comorbid with CD (ADHD+CD), and CD a subjective diagnosis. Therefore, the goal of this pilot study is to create the first explainable deep learning (DL) model for objective ECG-based ADHD/CD diagnosis as having an objective biomarker may improve diagnostic accuracy.Methods: The dataset used in this study consist of ECG data collected from 45 ADHD, 62 ADHD+CD, and 16 CD patients at the Child Guidance Clinic in Singapore. The ECG data were segmented into 2 s epochs and directly used to train our 1-dimensional (1D) convolutional neural network (CNN) model.Results: The proposed model yielded 96.04% classification accuracy, 96.26% precision, 95.99% sensitivity, and 96.11% F1-score. The Gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) function was also used to highlight the important ECG characteristics at specific time points that most impact the classification score.Conclusion: In addition to achieving model performance results with our suggested DL method, Grad-CAM's implementation also offers vital temporal data that clinicians and other mental healthcare professionals can use to make wise medical judgments. We hope that by conducting this pilot study, we will be able to encourage larger-scale research with a larger biosignal dataset. Hence allowing biosignal-based computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) tools to be implemented in healthcare and ambulatory settings, as ECG can be easily obtained via wearable devices such as smartwatches.

AB  - BackgroundStroke is a significant global health concern, ranking as the second leading cause of death and placing a substantial financial burden on healthcare systems, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Timely evaluation of stroke severity is crucial for predicting clinical outcomes, with standard assessment tools being the Rapid Arterial Occlusion Evaluation (RACE) and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). This study aims to utilize Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to predict stroke severity using these two distinct scales.MethodsWe conducted this study using two datasets collected from hospitals in Urmia, Iran, corresponding to stroke severity assessments based on RACE and NIHSS. Seven ML algorithms were applied, including K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Hyperparameter tuning was performed using grid search to optimize model performance, and SHapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) were used to interpret the contribution of individual features.ResultsAmong the models, the RF achieved the highest performance, with accuracies of 92.68% for the RACE dataset and 91.19% for the NIHSS dataset. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) was 92.02% and 97.86% for the RACE and NIHSS datasets, respectively. The SHAP analysis identified triglyceride levels, length of hospital stay, and age as critical predictors of stroke severity.ConclusionsThis study is the first to apply ML models to the RACE and NIHSS scales for predicting stroke severity. The use of SHAP enhances the interpretability of the models, increasing clinicians' trust in these ML algorithms. The best-performing ML model can be a valuable tool for assisting medical professionals in predicting stroke severity in clinical settings.

AB  - This study leverages deep learning to analyze sex differences in brain MRI data, aiming to further advance fairness in medical imaging. We employed 3D T1-weighted Magnetic Resonance images from four diverse datasets: Calgary-Campinas-359, OASIS-3, Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, and Cambridge Center for Aging and Neuroscience, ensuring a balanced representation of sexes and a broad demographic scope. Our methodology focused on minimal preprocessing to preserve the integrity of brain structures, utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network model for sex classification. The model achieved an accuracy of 87% on the test set without employing total intracranial volume (TIV) adjustment techniques. We observed that while the model exhibited biases at extreme brain sizes, it performed with less bias when the TIV distributions overlapped more. Saliency maps were used to identify brain regions significant in sex differentiation, revealing that certain supratentorial and infratentorial regions were important for predictions. Furthermore, our interdisciplinary team, comprising machine learning specialists and a radiologist, ensured diverse perspectives in validating the results. The detailed investigation of sex differences in brain MRI in this study, highlighted by the sex differences map, offers valuable insights into sex-specific aspects of medical imaging and could aid in developing sex-based bias mitigation strategies, contributing to the future development of fair AI algorithms. Awareness of the brain's differences between sexes enables more equitable AI predictions, promoting fairness in healthcare outcomes.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) detection using deep learning (DL) includes leveraging advanced neural network (NN) models to analyze medical data, namely imaging, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and patient records. This study introduces a new Nature Inspired Metaheuristic Algorithm with Deep Learning for Healthcare Data Analysis (NIMADL-HDA) technique. The NIMADL-HDA technique examines healthcare data for the recognition and classification of CVD. In the presented NIMADL-HDA technique, Z -score normalization was initially performed to normalize the input data. In addition, the NIMADL-HDA method made use of a barnacle mating optimizer (BMO) for the feature selection (FS) process. For healthcare data classification, a convolutional long short -term memory (CLSTM) model was employed. At last, the prairie dog optimization (PDO) algorithm was exploited for the optimal hyperparameter selection procedure. The experimentation outcome analysis of the NIMADL-HDA technique was verified on a benchmark healthcare dataset. The obtained outcomes stated that the NIMADL-HDA technique reached an effectual performance over other models. The NIMADL-HDA method provides an adaptable and sophisticated solution for healthcare data analysis, aiming to improve the interpretability and accuracy of the algorithm in terms of medical applications.

AB  - Accurate image interpretation is essential in the field of radiology to the healthcare team in order to provide optimal patient care. This article discusses the use of artificial intelligence (AI) confidence levels to enhance the accuracy and dependability of its radiological diagnoses. The current advances in AI technologies have changed how radiologists and clinicians make the diagnoses of pathological conditions such as aneurysms, hemorrhages, pneumothorax, pneumoperitoneum, and particularly fractures. To enhance the utility of these AI models, radiologists need a more comprehensive understanding of the model's levels of confidence and certainty behind the results they produce. This allows radiologists to make more informed decisions that have the potential to drastically change a patient's clinical management. Several AI models, especially those utilizing deep learning models (DL) with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have demonstrated significant potential in identifying subtle findings in medical imaging that are often missed by radiologists. It is necessary to create standardized levels of confidence metrics in order for AI systems to be relevant and reliable in the clinical setting. Incorporating AI into clinical practice does have certain obstacles like the need for clinical validation, concerns regarding the interpretability of AI system results, and addressing confusion and misunderstandings within the medical community. This study emphasizes the importance of AI systems to clearly convey their level of confidence in radiological diagnosis. This paper highlights the importance of conducting research to establish AI confidence level metrics that are limited to a specific anatomical region or lesion type. Key point of the view: Accurate fracture diagnosis relies on radiologic certainty, where Artificial intelligence (AI), especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and deep learning (DL), shows promise in enhancing X-ray interpretation amidst a shortage of radiologists. Overcoming integration challenges through improved AI interpretability and education is crucial for widespread acceptance and better patient outcomes.

AB  - Medical image classification is critical for accurate disease diagnosis, necessitating models that balance performance and interpretability. This study presents Dilated Y-Block-based Feature Summarized Pyramidal Attention Network (DY-FSPAN), a deep learning framework designed for robust feature extraction and classification. The architecture incorporates Y-blocks and attention mechanisms to enhance spatial feature representation while maintaining receptive field coherence. The proposed model achieves a classification accuracy of 98.5 %, surpassing existing approaches such as convolutional block attention networks, adversarial learning models, and multi-output 3D CNNs. To validate the efficacy of DY-FSPAN, we conduct an extensive experiment, including comparative benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods, robustness assessments, and ablation studies. The model's structural improvements are tested through various configurations to assess the impact of key components, confirming the contribution of attention mechanisms to performance enhancement. Grad-CAM analysis was employed to visualize learned feature maps, highlighting the model's focus on diagnostically relevant regions, thereby improving trust in AI-driven medical decision-making. From an explainable AI perspective, the proposed framework achieves superior classification accuracy and enhances interpretability, addressing a crucial requirement in medical imaging applications. The qualitative and quantitative analyses demonstrate that DY-FSPAN effectively localizes disease-specific features, making it a suitable tool for clinical use. The findings suggest that integrating attention-based architectures with optimized feature selection can significantly advance automated medical diagnosis. The model's ability to improve diagnostic reliability while maintaining transparency underscores its potential for real-world deployment in healthcare settings.

AB  - Medical imaging and deep learning models are essential to the early identification and diagnosis of brain cancers, facilitating timely intervention and improving patient outcomes. This research paper investigates the integration of YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art object detection framework, with non-local neural networks (NLNNs) to improve brain tumor detection's robustness and accuracy. This study begins by curating a comprehensive dataset comprising brain MRI scans from various sources. To facilitate effective fusion, the YOLOv5 and NLNNs, K-means+, and spatial pyramid pooling fast+ (SPPF+) modules are integrated within a unified framework. The brain tumor dataset is used to refine the YOLOv5 model through the application of transfer learning techniques, adapting it specifically to the task of tumor detection. The results indicate that the combination of YOLOv5 and other modules results in enhanced detection capabilities in comparison to the utilization of YOLOv5 exclusively, proving recall rates of 86% and 83% respectively. Moreover, the research explores the interpretability aspect of the combined model. By visualizing the attention maps generated by the NLNNs module, the regions of interest associated with tumor presence are highlighted, aiding in the understanding and validation of the decision-making procedure of the methodology. Additionally, the impact of hyperparameters, such as NLNNs kernel size, fusion strategy, and training data augmentation, is investigated to optimize the performance of the combined model.

AB  - Falls are a major risk factor for older adults, increasing morbidity and healthcare costs. Video-based fall-detection systems offer crucial real-time monitoring and assistance. Yet, their deployment faces challenges such as maintaining privacy, reducing false alarms, and providing understandable outputs for healthcare providers. This paper introduces an innovative automated fall-detection framework that includes a Gaussian blur module for privacy preservation, an OpenPose module for precise pose estimation, a short-time Fourier transform (STFT) module to capture frames with significant motion selectively, and a computationally efficient one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) classification module designed to classify these frames. Additionally, integrating a gradient-weighted class activation mapping (GradCAM) module enhances the system's explainability by visually highlighting the movement of the key points, resulting in classification decisions. Modular flexibility in our system allows customization to meet specific privacy and monitoring needs, enabling the activation or deactivation of modules according to the operational requirements of different healthcare settings. This combination of STFT and 1D-CNN ensures fast and efficient processing, which is essential in healthcare environments where real-time response and accuracy are vital. We validated our approach across multiple datasets, including the Multiple Cameras Fall Dataset (MCFD), the UR fall dataset, and the NTU RGB+D Dataset, which demonstrates high accuracy in detecting falls and provides the interpretability of results.

AB  - In DCE-MRI, the degree of contrast uptake in normal fibroglandular tissue, i.e., background parenchymal enhancement (BPE), is a crucial biomarker linked to breast cancer risk and treatment outcome. In accordance with the Breast Imaging Reporting & Data System (BI-RADS), it should be visually classified into four classes. The susceptibility of such an assessment to inter-reader variability highlights the urgent need for a standardized classification algorithm. In this retrospective study, the first post-contrast subtraction images for 27 healthy female subjects were included. The BPE was classified slice-wise by two expert radiologists. The extraction of radiomic features from segmented BPE was followed by dataset splitting and dimensionality reduction. The latent representations were then utilized as inputs to a deep neural network classifying BPE into BI-RADS classes. The network's predictions were elucidated at the radiomic feature level with Shapley values. The deep neural network achieved a BPE classification accuracy of 84 +/- 2% (p-value < 0.00001). Most of the misclassifications involved adjacent classes. Different radiomic features were decisive for the prediction of each BPE class underlying the complexity of the decision boundaries. A highly precise and explainable pipeline for BPE classification was achieved without user- or algorithm-dependent radiomic feature selection.

KW  - FRAMEWORK
AB  - AI has propelled the potential for moving toward personalized health and early prediction of diseases. Unfortunately, a significant limitation of many of these deep learning models is that they are not interpretable, restricting their clinical utility and undermining trust by clinicians. However, all existing methods are non-informative because they report generic or post-hoc explanations, and few or none support patient-specific, accurate, individualized patient-level explanations. Furthermore, existing approaches are often restricted to static, limited-domain datasets and are not generalizable across various healthcare scenarios. To tackle these problems, we propose a new deep learning approach called PersonalCareNet for personalized health monitoring based on the MIMIC-III clinical dataset. Our system jointly models convolutional neural networks with attention (CHARMS) and employs SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations) to obtain global and patient-specific model interpretability. We believe the model, enabled to leverage many clinical features, would offer clinically interpretable insights into the contribution of features while supporting real-time risk prediction, thus increasing transparency and instilling clinically-oriented trust in the model. We provide an extensive evaluation that shows PersonalCareNet achieves 97.86% accuracy, exceeding multiple notable SoTA healthcare risk prediction models. Explainability at Both Local and Global Level The framework offers explainability at local (using various matrix heatmaps for diagnosing models, such as force plots, SHAP summary visualizations, and confusion matrix-based diagnostics) and also at a global level through feature importance plots and Top-N list visualizations. As a result, we show quantitative results, demonstrating that much of the improvement can be achieved without paying a high price for interpretability. We have proposed a cost-effective and systematic approach as an AI-based platform that is scalable, accurate, transparent, and interpretable for critical care and personalized diagnostics. PersonalCareNet, by filling the void between performance and interpretability, promises a significant advancement in the field of reliable and clinically validated predictive healthcare AI. The design allows for additional extension to multiple data types and real-time deployment at the edge, creating a broader impact and adaptability.

AB  - Medical applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) have consistently shown remarkable performance in providing medical professionals and patients with support for complex tasks. Nevertheless, the use of these applications in sensitive clinical domains where high-stakes decisions are involved could be much more extensive if patients, medical professionals, and regulators were provided with mechanisms for trusting the results provided by AI systems. A key issue for achieving this is endowing AI systems with key dimensions of Trustworthy AI (TAI), such as fairness, transparency, robustness, or accountability, which are not usually considered within this context in a generalized and systematic manner. This paper reviews the recent advances in the TAI domain, including TAI standards and guidelines. We propose several requirements to be addressed in the design, development, and deployment of TAI systems and present a novel machine learning pipeline that contains TAI requirements as embedded components. Moreover, as an example of how current AI systems in medicine consider the TAI perspective, the study extensively reviews the recent literature (2017-2021) on AI systems in a prevalent and high social-impact disease: diagnosis and progression detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The most relevant AI systems in the AD domain are compared and discussed (such as machine learning, deep learning, ensembles, time series, and multimodal multitask) from the perspective of how they address TAI in their design. Several open challenges are highlighted, which could be claimed as one of the main reasons to justify the rare application of AI systems in real clinical environments. The study provides a roadmap to measure the TAI status of an AI systems and highlights its limitations. In addition, it provides the main guidelines to overcome these limitations and build medically trusted AI-based applications in the medical domain.

AB  - Introduction The prognostic landscape of stage III Lung Adenosquamous Carcinoma (ASC) following primary tumor resection remains underexplored. A thoughtfully developed prognostic model has the potential to guide clinicians in patient counseling and the formulation of effective therapeutic strategies.Methods Utilizing data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database spanning 2000 to 2018, this study identified independent prognostic factors influencing Overall Survival (OS) in ASC using Boruta analysis. Employing Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and Neural Network algorithms, predictive models were constructed. Model performance was assessed through key metrics, including Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC), calibration plot, Brier score, and Decision Curve Analysis (DCA).Results Among 241 eligible patients, seven clinical parameters-age, sex, primary tumor size, N stage, primary tumor site, chemotherapy, and systemic therapy-were identified as significant predictors of OS. Advanced age, male gender, larger tumor size, absence of chemotherapy, and lack of systemic therapy were associated with poorer survival. The Random Forest model outperformed others, achieving 3- and 5-year AUCs of 0.80/0.79 (training) and 0.74/0.65 (validation). It also demonstrated better calibration, lower Brier scores (training: 0.189/0.171; validation: 0.207/0.199), and more favorable DCA. SHAP values enhanced model interpretability by highlighting the impact of each parameter on survival predictions. To facilitate clinical application, the Random Forest model was deployed on a web-based server for accessible prognostic assessments.Conclusions This study presents a robust machine learning model and a web-based tool that assist healthcare practitioners in personalized clinical decision-making and treatment optimization for ASC patients following primary tumor resection.

AB  - The severe progression of Diabetes Mellitus (DM) stands out as one of the most significant concerns for healthcare officials worldwide. Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a common complication associated with diabetes, particularly affecting individuals between the ages of 18 and 65. As per the findings of the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) report, 35-60% of individuals suffering from DR possess a diabetes history. DR emerges as a leading cause of worldwide visual impairment. Due to the absence of ophthalmologists worldwide, insufficient health resources, and healthcare services, patients cannot get timely eye screening services. Automated computer-aided detection of DR provides a wide range of potential benefits. In contrast to traditional observer-driven techniques, automatic detection allows for a more objective analysis of numerous images in a shorter time. Moreover, Unsupervised Learning (UL) holds a high potential for image classification in healthcare, particularly regarding explainability and interpretability. Many studies on the detection of DR with both supervised and unsupervised Deep Learning (DL) methodologies are available. Surprisingly, none of the reviews presented thus far have highlighted the potential benefits of both supervised and unsupervised DL methods in Medical Imaging for the detection of DR. After a rigorous selection process, 103 articles were retrieved from four diverse and well-known databases (Web of Science, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and IEEE). This review provides a comprehensive summary of both supervised and unsupervised DL methods applied in DR detection, explaining the significant benefits of both techniques and covering aspects such as datasets, pre-processing, segmentation techniques, and supervised and unsupervised DL methods for detection. The insights from this review will aid academics and researchers in medical imaging to make informed decisions and choose the best practices for DR detection.

AB  - The implementation of clinical-decision support algorithms for medical imaging faces challenges with reliability and interpretability. Here, we establish a diagnostic tool based on a deep-learning framework for the screening of patients with common treatable blinding retinal diseases. Our framework utilizes transfer learning, which trains a neural network with a fraction of the data of conventional approaches. Applying this approach to a dataset of optical coherence tomography images, we demonstrate performance comparable to that of human experts in classifying age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema. We also provide a more transparent and interpretable diagnosis by highlighting the regions recognized by the neural network. We further demonstrate the general applicability of our AI system for diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia using chest X-ray images. This tool may ultimately aid in expediting the diagnosis and referral of these treatable conditions, thereby facilitating earlier treatment, resulting in improved clinical outcomes.

AB  - As a complex neural network system, the brain regions and genes collaborate to effectively store and transmit information. We abstract the collaboration correlations as the brain region gene community network (BG-CN) and present a new deep learning approach, such as the community graph convolutional neural network (Com-GCN), for investigating the transmission of information within and between communities. The results can be used for diagnosing and extracting causal factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD). First, an affinity aggregation model for BG-CN is developed to describe intercommunity and intracommunity information transmission. Second, we design the Com-GCN architecture with intercommunity convolution and intracommunity convolution operations based on the affinity aggregation model. Through sufficient experimental validation on the AD neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) dataset, the design of Com-GCN matches the physiological mechanism better and improves the interpretability and classification performance. Furthermore, Com-GCN can identify lesioned brain regions and disease-causing genes, which may assist precision medicine and drug design in AD and serve as a valuable reference for other neurological disorders.

AB  - Automatic identification of salient features in large medical datasets, particularly in chest x-ray (CXR) images, is a crucial research area. Accurately detecting critical findings such as emphysema, pneumothorax, and chronic bronchitis can aid radiologists in prioritizing time-sensitive cases and screening for abnormalities. However, traditional deep neural network approaches often require bounding box annotations, which can be time-consuming and challenging to obtain. This study proposes an explainable ensemble learning approach, CX-Net, for lung segmentation and diagnosing lung disorders using CXR images. We compare four state-of-the-art convolutional neural network models, including feature pyramid network, U-Net, LinkNet, and a customized U-Net model with ImageNet feature extraction, data augmentation, and dropout regularizations. All models are trained on the Montgomery and VinDR-CXR datasets with and without segmented ground-truth masks. To achieve model explainability, we integrate SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) techniques, which enable a better understanding of the decision-making process and provide visual explanations of critical regions within the CXR images. By employing ensembling, our outlier-resistant CX-Net achieves superior performance in lung segmentation, with Jaccard overlap similarity of 0.992, Dice coefficients of 0.994, precision of 0.993, recall of 0.980, and accuracy of 0.976. The proposed approach demonstrates strong generalization capabilities on the VinDr-CXR dataset and is the first study to use these datasets for semantic lung segmentation with semi-supervised localization. In conclusion, this paper presents an explainable ensemble learning approach for lung segmentation and diagnosing lung disorders using CXR images. Extensive experimental results show that our method efficiently and accurately extracts regions of interest in CXR images from publicly available datasets, indicating its potential for integration into clinical decision support systems. Furthermore, incorporating SHAP and Grad-CAM techniques further enhances the interpretability and trustworthiness of the AI-driven diagnostic system.

AB  - Accurate cost prediction of healthcare resources is challenging as diverse factors affect the overall prediction. The cost of healthcare providers is increasing exponentially as different healthcare providers charge differently for the same service due to various factors, majorly the sky rocketing inflation and increased population. It increases the importance of predicting healthcare costs to avoid unpleasant surprises. This study aims to provide the expected cost of healthcare providers that helps the patients in resource allocation and strengthens decision-making according to their resources. This paper proposes three hybrid Deep Learning (DL) models, Visual Geometry Group and Stacked Autoencoder (VGG-SAE), Visual Geometry Group and Deep Neural Network (VGG-DNN), and Stacked Autoencoder and Deep Neural Network (SAE-DNN), which optimize learning the hidden patterns from the given data more efficiently than individual models. The three hybrid DL models estimate the cost of healthcare providers effectively. The preprocessing is performed using the mode imputation for handling the missing values, Z-score for removing the outliers and standard scaler for standardizing the data. To train the hybrid models on optimum parameters, the Random Search technique is used that provides the best hyper-parameters of each hybrid model. The interpretation of the hybrid models' output is achieved using the SHapley Additive ExPlanations (SHAP) technique. The performances of VGG-SAE, VGG-DNN, and SAE-DNN are compared with the baseline DL models such as SAE, DNN, and VGG. To assess the robustness of the proposed approach, the hybrid models are trained on two different datasets of healthcare such as Healthcare Providers and Hospital Inpatient Cost Transparency. With the hyper-parameter tuning of the Healthcare Providers Dataset, VGG-SAE achieved MSE of 0.01, RMSE of 0.13, MAE of 0.02, and R-squared of 0.98. VGG-DNN achieved MSE of 0.01, RMSE of 0.12, MAE of 0.02, and R-squared of 0.99. SAE-DNN achieved MSE of 0.01, RMSE of 0.11, MAE of 0.02, and R-squared of 0.99. With the hyper-parameter tuning of the Hospital Inpatient Cost Transparency Dataset, VGG-SAE achieved MSE of 0.007, RMSE of 0.08, MAE of 0.03, R-squared of 0.99, and execution time of 1680 seconds. VGG-DNN achieved MSE of 0.0006, RMSE of 0.08, MAE of 0.03, R-squared of 0.99, and execution time of 645 seconds. SAE-DNN achieved MSE of 0.003, RMSE of 0.06, MAE of 0.02, R-squared of 0.99, and execution time of 850 seconds. Our proposed hybrid combinations outperformed other deep models and Machine Learning (ML) techniques such as SAE, DNN, VGG, SVR and GBR, which ensures high efficiency of the proposed models in terms of healthcare providers cost.

AB  - Rapid advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) in healthcare raise pressing questions about how much users should trust AI/ML systems, particularly for high stakes clinical decision-making. Ensuring that user trust is properly calibrated to a tool's computational capacities and limitations has both practical and ethical implications, given that overtrust or undertrust can influence over-reliance or under-reliance on algorithmic tools, with significant implications for patient safety and health outcomes. It is, thus, important to better understand how variability in trust criteria across stakeholders, settings, tools and use cases may influence approaches to using AI/ML tools in real settings. As part of a 5-year, multi-institutional Agency for Health Care Research and Quality-funded study, we identify trust criteria for a survival prediction algorithm intended to support clinical decision-making for left ventricular assist device therapy, using semistructured interviews (n=40) with patients and physicians, analysed via thematic analysis. Findings suggest that physicians and patients share similar empirical considerations for trust, which were primarily epistemic in nature, focused on accuracy and validity of AI/ML estimates. Trust evaluations considered the nature, integrity and relevance of training data rather than the computational nature of algorithms themselves, suggesting a need to distinguish 'source' from 'functional' explainability. To a lesser extent, trust criteria were also relational (endorsement from others) and sometimes based on personal beliefs and experience. We discuss implications for promoting appropriate and responsible trust calibration for clinical decision-making use AI/ML.

AB  - Facial Action Unit (AU) detection is of major importance in a broad range of artificial intelligence applications such as healthcare, Facial Expression Recognition (FER), and mental state analysis. In this paper, we present an innovative, resource-efficient facial AU detection model, embedding both spatial and channel attention mechanisms into a convolutional neural network (CNN). Along with a unique data input system leveraging image data and binary-encoded AU activation labels, our model enhances AU detection capabilities while simultaneously offering interpretability for FER systems. In contrast to existing state-of-the-art models, our proposal's streamlined architecture, combined with superior performance, establishes it as an ideal solution for resource-limited environments like mobile and embedded systems with computational constraints. The model was trained and evaluated utilizing the BP4D, CK+, DISFA, FER2013+, and RAF-DB datasets, with the latter two being particularly significant as they represent wild datasets for facial expression recognition. These datasets encompass ground truth emotions matched with corresponding AU activations according to the Facial Action Coding System. Various metrics, including F1 score, accuracy, and Euclidean distance, showcase its effectiveness in AU detection and interpretability.

AB  - Melanoma is a more dangerous skin cancer than other types of skin cancer because it rapidly spreads to other organs in its early stages. In the increasingly popular task of computer-aided diagnosis using deep learning methods, these models are difficult to interpret and often considered "black boxes". The lack of interpretation of the model prevents the target users from fully understanding it. This study proposes a new interpretable hierarchical semantic convolutional neural network (MEL-HSNet) to diagnose melanoma. The benefits and strength of our approach are a white-box model that not only predicts whether a skin lesion observed in a dermoscopy scan image is melanoma but also provides explanatory information for decision-making. Compared to other convolutional neural networks, the MEL-HSNet model proposed in this study can generate interpretable information on melanoma prediction and obtain significantly better results compared to the other available models.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health concern with rising prevalence and huge costs associated with dialysis and transplantation. Early prediction of CKD can reduce the patient's risk of CKD progression to end-stage kidney failure. Artificial intelligence offers more intelligent and expert healthcare services in disease diagnosis. In this work, a deep learning model is built using deep neural networks (DNN) with an adaptive moment estimation optimization function to predict early-stage CKD. The health care applications require interpretability over the predictions of the black-box model to build conviction towards the model's prediction. Hence, the predictions of the DNN-CKD model are explained by the local interpretable model-agnostic explainer (LIME). The diagnostic patient data is trained on five layered DNN with three hidden layers. Over the unseen data, the DNN-CKD model yields an accuracy of 98.75% and a roc_auc score of 98.86% in detecting CKD risk. The explanation revealed by the LIME algorithm echoes the influence of each feature on the prediction made by the DNN-CKD model over the given CKD data. With its interpretability and accuracy, the proposed system may effectively help medical experts in the early diagnosis of CKD.

AB  - The problem of the explainability of AI decision-making has attracted considerable attention in recent years. In considering AI diagnostics we suggest that explainability should be explicated as 'effective contestability'. Taking a patient-centric approach we argue that patients should be able to contest the diagnoses of AI diagnostic systems, and that effective contestation of patient-relevant aspect of AI diagnoses requires the availability of different types of information about 1) the AI system's use of data, 2) the system's potential biases, 3) the system performance, and 4) the division of labour between the system and health care professionals. We justify and define thirteen specific informational requirements that follows from 'contestability'. We further show not only that contestability is a weaker requirement than some of the proposed criteria of explainability, but also that it does not introduce poorly grounded double standards for AI and health care professionals' diagnostics, and does not come at the cost of AI system performance. Finally, we briefly discuss whether the contestability requirements introduced here are domain-specific.

AB  - Introduction The early identification of brain tumors is essential for optimal treatment and patient prognosis. Advancements in MRI technology have markedly enhanced tumor detection yet necessitate accurate classification for appropriate therapeutic approaches. This underscores the necessity for sophisticated diagnostic instruments that are precise and comprehensible to healthcare practitioners.Methods Our research presents CNN-TumorNet, a convolutional neural network for categorizing MRI images into tumor and non-tumor categories. Although deep learning models exhibit great accuracy, their complexity frequently restricts clinical application due to inadequate interpretability. To address this, we employed the LIME technique, augmenting model transparency and offering explicit insights into its decision-making process.Results CNN-TumorNet attained a 99% accuracy rate in differentiating tumors from non-tumor MRI scans, underscoring its reliability and efficacy as a diagnostic instrument. Incorporating LIME guarantees that the model's judgments are comprehensible, enhancing its clinical adoption.Discussion Despite the efficacy of CNN-TumorNet, the overarching challenge of deep learning interpretability persists. These models may function as "black boxes," complicating doctors' ability to trust and accept them without comprehending their rationale. By integrating LIME, CNN-TumorNet achieves elevated accuracy alongside enhanced transparency, facilitating its application in clinical environments and improving patient care in neuro-oncology.

AB  - Computer vision and deep learning have the potential to improve medical artificial intelligence (AI) by assisting in diagnosis, prediction, and prognosis. However, the application of deep learning to medical image analysis is challenging due to limited data availability and imbalanced data. While model performance is undoubtedly essential for medical image analysis, model trust is equally important. To address these challenges, we propose TRUDLMIA, a trustworthy deep learning framework for medical image analysis, which leverages image features learned through self-supervised learning and utilizes a novel surrogate loss function to build trustworthy models with optimal performance. The framework is validated on three benchmark data sets for detecting pneumonia, COVID-19, and melanoma, and the created models prove to be highly competitive, even outperforming those designed specifically for the tasks. Furthermore, we conduct ablation studies, cross-validation, and result visualization and demonstrate the contribution of proposed modules to both model performance (up to 21%) and model trust (up to 5%). We expect that the proposed framework will support researchers and clinicians in advancing the use of deep learning for dealing with public health crises, improving patient outcomes, increasing diagnostic accuracy, and enhancing the overall quality of healthcare delivery.

AB  - Diagnostic histopathology faces increasing demands due to aging populations and expanding healthcare programs. Semi-automated diagnostic systems employing deep learning methods are one approach to alleviate this pressure. The learning models for histopathology are inherently complex and opaque from the user's perspective. Hence different methods have been developed to interpret their behavior. However, relatively limited attention has been devoted to the connection between interpretation methods and the knowledge of experienced pathologists. The main contribution of this paper is a method for comparing morphological patterns used by expert pathologists to detect cancer with the patterns identified as important for inference of learning models. Given the patch-based nature of processing large-scale histopathological imaging, we have been able to show statistically that the VGG16 model could utilize all the structures that are observable by the pathologist, given the patch size and scan resolution. The results show that the neural network approach to recognizing prostatic cancer is similar to that of a pathologist at medium optical resolution. The saliency maps identified several prevailing histomorphological features characterizing carcinoma, e.g., single-layered epithelium, small lumina, and hyperchromatic nuclei with halo. A convincing finding was the recognition of their mimickers in non-neoplastic tissue. The method can also identify differences, i.e., standard patterns not used by the learning models and new patterns not yet used by pathologists. Saliency maps provide added value for automated digital pathology to analyze and fine-tune deep learning systems and improve trust in computer-based decisions.

AB  - Objective: COVID-19 has made an unprecedented impact on humanity. The Healthcare sector, in an effort to curb COVID-19, could leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) to its aid, especially in diagnosing it through the classification of Chest-CT scans. However, data scarcity plagues the medical domain. Therefore, any AI solution must be capable of learning from limited data. Also the resulting AI could relieve radiologists from exhaustion and aid medical practitioners as a valuable diagnostic tool.Methods: Our proposed model DenSplitnet uses Dense blocks to learn image features, Self-Supervised Learning for pre-training to learn the context, and a novel two-way split branch at the final classification layer for classifier-invariant generalization ability. Results: DenSplitnet achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark chest-CT scan datasets for COVID-19. The model performs well on the Sars-cov-2 ct-scan dataset. The Test accuracy is 91.92%, F1-Score is 91.30%, Precision is 96.55%, and Recall is 87.04%. The model achieves test accuracy of 86.17%, Precision of 82.94%, Recall of 83.72%, and F1-Score of 83.23% on the Sars-cov-2 ct-scan multiclass dataset. The model obtains a test accuracy of 86.21%, an F1-Score of 83.91%, and an AUC of 0.95 in the Covid-ct-dataset. The model obtains a test accuracy that is 73.11% and an F1-Score of 70.97% in the TransferLearn-ct dataset.Conclusion: The findings support the practical usability of the DenSplitnet as a technological AI assistance to radiologists and other medical professionals, alongside Grad-CAM plots for explainable AI and the theoretical examination of the classifier-invariant generalization capacity of the network. The healthcare sector can benefit from this technology in a number of ways.

AB  - Non-contact remote photoplethysmography can be used in a variety of medical and healthcare fields by measuring vital signs continuously and unobtrusively. Recently, end-to-end deep learning methods have been proposed to replace the existing handcrafted features. However, since the existing deep learning methods are known as black box models, the problem of interpretability has been raised, and the same problem exists in the remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) network. In this study, we propose a method to visualize temporal and spectral representations for hidden layers, deeply supervise the spectral representation of intermediate layers through the depth of networks and optimize it for a lightweight model. The optimized network improves performance and enables fast training and inference times. The proposed spectral deep supervision helps to achieve not only high performance but also fast convergence speed through the regularization of the intermediate layers. The effect of the proposed methods was confirmed through a thorough ablation study on public datasets. As a result, similar or outperforming results were obtained in comparison to state-of-the-art models. In particular, our model achieved an RMSE of 1 bpm on the PURE dataset, demonstrating its high accuracy. Moreover, it excelled on the V4V dataset with an impressive RMSE of 6.65 bpm, outperforming other methods. We observe that our model began converging from the very first epoch, a significant improvement over other models in terms of learning efficiency. Our approach is expected to be generally applicable to models that learn spectral domain information as well as to the applications of regression that require the representations of periodicity.

AB  - Metaheuristic algorithms (MH) and machine learning (ML) are important components of artificial intelligence (AI). The synergy between MH's optimization search capabilities and ML's data analysis strengths has proven to be highly effective, providing a powerful combination for delivering high-quality solutions across diverse fields. Particularly in real-world applications such as autonomous driving and healthcare, the integration of MH and ML can significantly enhance the intelligence level and decision-making efficiency of systems, addressing the urgent societal and industrial demands for high-efficiency and high-precision solutions. This paper clarifies the logic behind the surge in research on MH-ML hybrid algorithms and addresses the gaps in current reviews regarding their timeliness and breadth of perspective. We begin by elucidating the fundamental concepts underpinning MH and ML, followed by a comprehensive classification framework that categorizes and synthesizes the latest research findings systematically. The paper concludes with an exploration of the challenges inherent in MH-ML hybrid algorithms and proposes future research directions. The analysis of the collected literature demonstrates that the integration of MH and ML generally enhances the performance of algorithms in specific problems. Despite progress from simple combinations to deeper integrations, challenges such as theoretical lag and interpretability remain. Future research will focus on solving these challenges by exploring further integration, using open-source tools, and adapting across diverse domains to expand the use of MH-ML hybrid algorithms.

AB  - Financial management prediction, often known as financial forecasting, is the act of estimating future financial outcomes using past data and present trends. It is an essential component of financial analysis and planning that aids businesses in making well-informed decisions and preparing for potential future events. In the healthcare domain, financial management prediction is a crucial task that helps patients track and predict the expenses required for their medical services. The established methods for financial management prediction have some flaws, such as the requirement of labeled data, data quality, time complexity, under fitting problems, and longer execution times. Therefore, in order to resolve these limitations; a deep learning-based model is developed in this study for efficient financial management prediction. Specifically, this research proposes a dual-recurrent neural network with a tri-channel attention mechanism (DR-Z2AN) for accurate prediction. The proposed DR-Z2AN model combines the tri-channel attention mechanism with dual-RNN and multi-head attention, which enhances the robustness and interpretability of the systems. The multi-head attention learns the complex relationships between the data, which develops the generalization capability of the model in prediction tasks. The combined model efficiently processes the sequence data, and the tri-channel attention improves the model's capacity to extract meaningful characteristics from the input. The integration of the incentive learning approach helps the model improve the learning parameters to get better results with the minimum error. The experimental results demonstrate that the DR-Z2AN model attains minimal error in terms of MAE, MAPE, MSE, and RMSE of 1.46, 3.83, 4.32, and 2.08, respectively; thus, the proposed approach gives better results than the other traditional methods. Overall, the DR-Z2AN model offers accurate predictions with reduced computational time and improved interpretability.

AB  - The escalating global prevalence of diabetes has underscored the critical need for effective screening and diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy (DR), a common complication of diabetes that can lead to irreversible vision loss. In this study, we propose a novel algorithm for automated DR detection in retinal fundus images using deep learning techniques. The algorithm incorporates a cheetah optimized convolutional neural network (CO-CNN) that draws inspiration from cheetah hunting behavior for efficient image processing, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. Preprocessing steps involve median filter and contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization to enhance image quality. The segmented output is clustered using the cascaded fuzzy C-means algorithm and features are extracted with the speeded-up robust features algorithm. The experimental results on the Indian Diabetic Retinopathy Image Dataset demonstrate an accuracy of 98.64% in predicting various stages of DR. The proposed CO-CNN approach shows superior performance compared to that of state-of-the-art methods, offering potential applications in telemedicine, treatment planning, early detection, screening, and patient education. Integrating fuzzy logic enhances the model's interpretability and robustness, paving the way for improved healthcare outcomes in diabetic retinopathy management.

AB  - Polygenic risk score (PRS) is a widely used approach for predicting individuals' genetic risk of complex diseases, playing a pivotal role in advancing precision medicine. Traditional PRS methods, predominantly following a linear structure, often fall short in capturing the intricate relationships between genotype and phenotype. In this study, we present PRS-Net, an interpretable geometric deep learning-based framework that effectively models the nonlinearity of biological systems for enhanced disease prediction and biological discovery. PRS-Net begins by deconvoluting the genome-wide PRS at the single-gene resolution and then explicitly encapsulates gene-gene interactions leveraging a graph neural network (GNN) for genetic risk prediction, enabling a systematic characterization of molecular interplay underpinning diseases. An attentive readout module is introduced to facilitate model interpretation. Extensive tests across multiple complex traits and diseases demonstrate the superior prediction performance of PRS-Net compared with a wide range of conventional PRS methods. The interpretability of PRS-Net further enhances the identification of disease-relevant genes and gene programs. PRS-Net provides a potent tool for concurrent genetic risk prediction and biological discovery for complex diseases.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR), a leading cause of vision loss worldwide, poses a critical challenge to healthcare systems due to its silent progression and the reliance on labor-intensive, subjective manual screening by ophthalmologists, especially amid a global shortage of eye care specialists. Addressing the pressing need for scalable, objective, and interpretable diagnostic tools, this work introduces RetinoDeep-deep learning frameworks integrating hybrid architectures and explainable AI to enhance the automated detection and classification of DR across seven severity levels. Specifically, we propose four novel models: an EfficientNetB0 combined with an SPCL transformer for robust global feature extraction; a ResNet50 ensembled with Bi-LSTM to synergize spatial and sequential learning; a Bi-LSTM optimized through genetic algorithms for hyperparameter tuning; and a Bi-LSTM with SHAP explainability to enhance model transparency and clinical trustworthiness. The models were trained and evaluated on a curated dataset of 757 retinal fundus images, augmented to improve generalization, and benchmarked against state-of-the-art baselines (including EfficientNetB0, Hybrid Bi-LSTM with EfficientNetB0, Hybrid Bi-GRU with EfficientNetB0, ResNet with filter enhancements, Bi-LSTM optimized using Random Search Algorithm (RSA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), and a standard Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)), using metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, and precision. Notably, the Bi-LSTM with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) outperformed other configurations, achieving superior stability and generalization, while SHAP visualizations confirmed alignment between learned features and key retinal biomarkers, reinforcing the system's interpretability. By combining cutting-edge neural architectures, advanced optimization, and explainable AI, this work sets a new standard for DR screening systems, promising not only improved diagnostic performance but also potential integration into real-world clinical workflows.

AB  - Accurate prediction of future blood glucose (BG) levels can effectively improve BG management for people living with type 1 or 2 diabetes, thereby reducing complications and improving quality of life. The state of the art of BG prediction has been achieved by leveraging advanced deep learning methods to model multimodal data, i.e., sensor data and self-reported event data, organized as multi-variate time series (MTS). However, these methods are mostly regarded as "black boxes"and not entirely trusted by clinicians and patients. In this paper, we propose interpretable graph attentive recurrent neural networks (GARNNs) to model MTS, explaining variable contributions via summarizing variable importance and generating feature maps by graph attention mechanisms instead of post-hoc analysis. We evaluate GARNNs on four datasets, representing diverse clinical scenarios. Upon comparison with fifteen well-established baseline methods, GARNNs not only achieve the best prediction accuracy but also provide high-quality temporal interpretability, in particular for postprandial glucose levels as a result of corresponding meal intake and insulin injection. These findings underline the potential of GARNN as a robust tool for improving diabetes care, bridging the gap between deep learning technology and real-world healthcare solutions.

AB  - Medical imaging is a cornerstone of modern healthcare, enabling precise diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. Traditional machine learning (ML) approaches have significantly improved medical image analysis, yet they face challenges such as data scarcity, lack of interpretability, and variability in imaging protocols. Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) offers a transformative solution by integrating fundamental physical laws, usually in partial differential equations and boundary conditions, into data-driven ML models. PIML constrains the solution space, enhances interpretability, and reduces the dependency on large, annotated datasets. This review provides an overview of the principles, methodologies, and applications of PIML in medical imaging, with a focus on imaging modalities such as MRI, CT, and ultrasound. We discuss the taxonomy of PIML approaches based on observational, inductive, and learning biases, showing their roles in enhancing model accuracy and generalization. Additionally, we explore the impact of PIML on image reconstruction, segmentation, enhancement, and anomaly detection, demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing noise, resolution, and diagnostic accuracy challenges. Despite its advantages, PIML faces challenges in the accurate representation of complex physiological processes, computational efficiency, and the integration of physics-based priors across diverse applications. This review points out future research directions including the development of hybrid models that combine PIML with deep learning techniques and large foundation models, improved benchmark datasets, and scalable algorithms for real-time applications. The findings of this review highlight PIML as a pivotal approach for advancing medical imaging, bridging the gap between theoretical models and practical implementation in clinical settings.

AB  - The detection of falls is an essential component of healthcare monitoring systems, especially for older people at a greater risk of falling than younger people. To address the shortcomings of previously established methodologies, this research proposes a unique Artificial Intelligence driven sensor-based methodology that utilizes the SisFall dataset in conjunction with a Recurrent Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory model. Two methods were considered: one using a Butterworth filter and the other without filtering. The results emphasize the significance of noise reduction in enhancing model performance. Additionally, the integration of Explainable Artificial Intelligence techniques brings transparency and interpretability to the model's predictions, enhancing its dependability and trustworthiness in healthcare applications. Using Artificial Intelligence driven fall detection with Explainable Artificial Intelligence for transparent decision-making, this methodology presents a robust approach to improving accuracy and reducing false alarms in real-world healthcare settings. The study demonstrates that combining advanced filtering techniques with Explainable Artificial Intelligence algorithms successfully overcomes the challenges associated with traditional fall detection systems. The findings further confirm that the application of an Artificial Intelligence based Butterworth filter significantly enhances model accuracy, achieving 98.96% compared to 79.77% without filtering. These findings highlight the potential of Artificial Intelligence driven fall detection systems in healthcare, paving the way for more accurate, interpretable, and reliable monitoring solutions that can enhance elderly safety and improve real-time clinical decision-making.

AB  - Deep Learning (DL) offers promising solutions for analyzing wearable signals and gaining valuable insights into cognitive disorders. While previous review studies have explored various aspects of DL in cognitive healthcare, there remains a lack of comprehensive analysis that integrates wearable signals, data processing techniques, and the broader applications, benefits, and challenges of DL methods. Addressing this limitation, our study provides an extensive review of DL's role in cognitive healthcare, with a particular emphasis on wearables, data processing, and the inherent challenges in this field. This review also highlights the considerable promise of DL approaches in addressing a broad spectrum of cognitive issues. By enhancing the understanding and analysis of wearable signal modalities, DL models can achieve remarkable accuracy in cognitive healthcare. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) networks have demonstrated improved performance and effectiveness in the early diagnosis and progression monitoring of neurological disorders. Beyond cognitive impairment detection, DL has been applied to emotion recognition, sleep analysis, stress monitoring, and neurofeedback. These applications lead to advanced diagnosis, personalized treatment, early intervention, assistive technologies, remote monitoring, and reduced healthcare costs. Nevertheless, the integration of DL and wearable technologies presents several challenges, such as data quality, privacy, interpretability, model generalizability, ethical concerns, and clinical adoption. These challenges emphasize the importance of conducting future research in areas such as multimodal signal analysis and explainable AI. The findings of this review aim to benefit clinicians, healthcare professionals, and society by facilitating better patient outcomes in cognitive healthcare.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an advancing disease which significantly impacts global healthcare, requiring early detection and prompt treatment is required to prevent its advancement to end-stage renal disease. Conventional diagnostic methods tend to be invasive, lengthy, and costly, creating a demand for automated, precise, and efficient solutions. This study proposes a novel technique for identifying and classifying CKD from medical images by utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network based Crow Search (CNN based CS) algorithm. The method employs sophisticated pre-processing techniques, including Z-score standardization, min-max normalization and robust scaling to improve the input data's quality. Selection of features is carried out using the chi-square test, and the Crow Search Algorithm (CSA) further optimizes the feature set for the improvement of accuracy classification and effectivess. The CNN architecture is employed to capture complex patterns using deep learning methods to accurately classify CKD in medical pictures. The model optimized and examined using an open access Kidney CT Scan data set. It achieved 99.05% accuracy, 99.03% Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC), and 99.01% Area under the precision-recall curve (PR-AUC), along with high precision (99.04%), recall (99.02%), and F1-score (99.00%). The results show that the CNN-based CS method delivers high accuracy and improved diagnostic precision related to conventional machine learning techniques. By incorporating CSA for feature optimization, the approach minimizes redundancy and improves model interpretability. This makes it a promising tool for automated CKD diagnosis, contributing to the development of AI-driven medical diagnostics and providing a scalable solution for early detection and management of CKD.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Automatic classification of ECG signal arrhythmias plays a vital role in early cardiovascular diagnostics by enabling prompt detection of life-threatening conditions. Manual ECG interpretation is labor-intensive and susceptible to errors, highlighting the demand for automated, scalable approaches. Deep learning (DL) methods are effective in ECG analysis due to their ability to learn complex patterns from raw signals. Methods: This study introduces two models: a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) with a dual-branch architecture for processing ECG signals and demographic data (e.g., age, gender), and a modified VGG16 model adapted for multi-branch input. Using the PTB-XL dataset, a widely adopted large-scale ECG database with over 20,000 recordings, the models were evaluated on binary, multiclass, and subclass classification tasks across 2, 5, 10, and 15 disease categories. Advanced preprocessing techniques, combined with demographic features, significantly enhanced performance. Results: The CNN model achieved up to 97.78% accuracy in binary classification and 79.7% in multiclass tasks, outperforming the VGG16 model (97.38% and 76.53%, respectively) and state-of-the-art benchmarks like CNN-LSTM and CNN entropy features. This study also emphasizes interpretability, providing lead-specific insights into ECG contributions to promote clinical transparency. Conclusions: These results confirm the models' potential for accurate, explainable arrhythmia detection and their applicability in real-world healthcare diagnostics.

AB  - Background: Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have contributed to improved predictive modeling in health care, particularly in oncology. Traditional methods often rely on structured tabular data, but these approaches can struggle to capture complex interactions among clinical variables. Image generator for health tabular data (IGHT) transform tabular electronic medical record (EMR) data into structured 2D image matrices, enabling the use of powerful computer vision-based deep learning models. This approach offers a novel baseline for survival prediction in colorectal cancer by leveraging spatial encoding of clinical features, Objective: This study aimed to develop and evaluate a deep learning model using EMR data to predict 5-year overall survival in patients with colorectal cancer and to examine the clinical interpretability of model predictions using explainable artificial Methods: Anonymized EMR data of 3321 patients at the Gil Medical Center were analyzed. The dataset included demographic details, tumor characteristics, laboratory values, treatment modalities, and follow-up outcomes. Clinical variables were converted into 2D image matrices using the IGHT. Patients were stratified into colon and rectal cancer groups to account for biological and prognostic differences. Three models were developed and compared: a conventional artificial neural network (ANN), a basic convolutional neural network (CNN), and a transfer learning-based Visual Geometry Group (VGG)16 model. Model performance was assessed using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1-scores. To interpret model decisions, gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) was applied to visualize regions of the input images that contributed most to predictions, Results: Among the tested models, VGG16 exhibited superior predictive performance, achieving an accuracy of 78.44% for colon cancer and 74.83% for rectal cancer. It showed notably high specificity (89.55% for colon cancer and 87.9% for rectal cancer), indicating strong reliability in correctly identifying patients likely to survive beyond 5 years. Compared to ANN and low specificity, which limits its immediate applicability in clinical settings. Conclusions:The proposed IGHT-based deep learning model, particularly leveraging theVGG16 architecture, demonstrates promising accuracy and interpretability in predicting 5-year overall survival in patients with colorectal cancer. Its capability to effectively stratify patients into risk categories with balanced sensitivity and specificity underscores its potential utility as a clinical decision support system (CDSS) tool. Future studies incorporating external validation with multicenter cohorts and prospective designs are necessary to establish generalizability and clinical integration feasibility.

TI  - Deep learning-based classification of lymphedema and other lower limb edema diseases using clinical images
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA  - English
KW  - DIAGNOSIS
AB  - Lymphedema is a chronic condition characterized by lymphatic fluid accumulation, primarily affecting the limbs. Its diagnosis is challenging due to symptom overlap with conditions like chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and systemic diseases, often leading to diagnostic delays that can extend up to ten years. These delays negatively impact patient outcomes and burden healthcare systems. Conventional diagnostic methods rely heavily on clinical expertise, which may fail to distinguish subtle variations between these conditions. This study investigates the application of artificial intelligence (AI), specifically deep learning, to improve diagnostic accuracy for lower limb edema. A dataset of 1622 clinical images was used to train sixteen convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer-based models, including EfficientNetV2, which achieved the highest accuracy of 78.6%. Grad-CAM analyses enhanced model interpretability, highlighting clinically relevant features such as swelling and hyperpigmentation. The AI system consistently outperformed human evaluators, whose diagnostic accuracy plateaued at 62.7%. The findings underscore the transformative potential of AI as a diagnostic tool, particularly in distinguishing conditions with overlapping clinical presentations. By integrating AI with clinical workflows, healthcare systems can reduce diagnostic delays, enhance accuracy, and alleviate the burden on medical professionals. While promising, the study acknowledges limitations, such as dataset diversity and the controlled evaluation environment, which necessitate further validation in real-world settings. This research highlights the potential of AI-driven diagnostics to revolutionize lymphedema care, bridging gaps in conventional methods and supporting healthcare professionals in delivering more precise and timely interventions. Future work should focus on external validation and hybrid systems integrating AI and clinical expertise for comprehensive diagnostic solutions.

AB  - Glucose monitoring plays a vital role in maintaining metabolic and nutritional balance. However, invasive methods, while accurate, are often painful and impractical for routine use. This study presents a non-invasive glucose monitoring framework that integrates a high-intensity Superbright optical sensor with an IoT-enabled data acquisition system using ESP32 microcontrollers and Raspberry Pi. The IoT-based architecture enables seamless integration with cloud computing platforms, allowing remote access and scalability for large-scale population-level screening and monitoring. The system captures glucose-related optical signals, which are analyzed using various machine learning algorithms, including a novel Convolutional Neural Network-Attention Hybrid Model (CNN-AHM). CNN-AHM combines spatial feature extraction with attention-based prioritization of relevant signal patterns, enhancing both accuracy and interpretability. Among all models tested, CNN-AHM demonstrated the best standalone performance (RMSE =14.06 mg/dL), representing a 13.18% improvement over its baseline configuration. When combined with complementary strength of the second-best performing Random Forest Regressor (RF-R), the system achieved a substantially improved RMSE of 7.62 mg/dL and an R-2 of 0.83. This work underscores the importance of integrating sensor technology, deep learning, and explainable modeling to advance non-invasive glucose monitoring solutions. Future directions include extending the architecture with explainable AI using SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) to provide feature-level interpretability, and exploring real-world deployment scenarios.

AB  - Recognizing human activities from Surface Electromyography (sEMG) signals is fraught with challenges, including noise susceptibility and signal crosstalk. Addressing these, our study analyses sEMG data from 11 healthy and 11 pathological subjects across three distinct activities: sitting, standing, and walking. We introduce a pioneering preprocessing approach that integrates Bandpass Filtering, Wavelet Denoising, and Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) for signal enhancement. A significant aspect of our approach involves the reconstruction of signals by selecting the top 50% of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) based on entropy, Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), correlation, and energy, effectively capturing the most informative features of the sEMG signals. To counterbalance dataset imbalances and facilitate robust feature extraction, we applied Adaptive Synthetic (ADASYN) sampling and segmented the data into 256 ms windows with a 25% overlap. Our Convolution Neural Network (CNN) achieves remarkable classification accuracies: for sitting, 99.4% in healthy and 99.2% in pathological subjects; for standing, 99.7% and 98.8% respectively; and for walking, 99.4% and 98.6%, respectively. Furthermore, the integration of Explainable AI (XAI) through Permutation Feature Importance (PFI) provides critical insights into the significant impact of muscle signals, particularly highlighting the Rectus Femoris (RF) muscle's role in sitting with leg extension, BF muscles's role in standing with flexion. This comprehensive and innovative methodology not only overcomes the inherent challenges of sEMG signal analysis but also enhances the interpretability and reliability of activity recognition, marking a significant advancement for personalized healthcare interventions.

AB  - Medical artificial intelligence (AI) systems have been remarkably successful, even outperforming human performance at certain tasks. There is no doubt that AI is important to improve human health in many ways and will disrupt various medical workflows in the future. Using AI to solve problems in medicine beyond the lab, in routine environments, we need to do more than to just improve the performance of existing AI methods. Robust AI solutions must be able to cope with imprecision, missing and incorrect information, and explain both the result and the process of how it was obtained to a medical expert. Using conceptual knowledge as a guiding model of reality can help to develop more robust, explainable, and less biased machine learning models that can ideally learn from less data. Achieving these goals will require an orchestrated effort that combines three complementary Frontier Research Areas: (1) Complex Networks and their Inference, (2) Graph causal models and counterfactuals, and (3) Verification and Explainability methods. The goal of this paper is to describe these three areas from a unified view and to motivate how information fusion in a comprehensive and integrative manner can not only help bring these three areas together, but also have a transformative role by bridging the gap between research and practical applications in the context of future trustworthy medical AI. This makes it imperative to include ethical and legal aspects as a cross-cutting discipline, because all future solutions must not only be ethically responsible, but also legally compliant.

AB  - Background and Objective: The automatic recognition of myocardial infarction (MI) by artificial intelligence (AI) has been an emerging topic of academic research and an existing classification method that can recognize conventional electrocardiogram (ECG) signals with high accuracy. However, they are employed to classify one-dimensional (1-D) ECG signals rather than three-dimensional (3-D) ECG images, and it is limited to provide physicians with significant recommendations to aid in diagnosis like highlighting abnormal leads. Other studies on 3-D ECG images either did not achieve high accuracy or did not employ an inter-patient classification scheme. By proposing a multi-VGG deep neural network, this study aims to develop an automatic classification method for identifying myocardial infarction with inter patient high accuracy and proper interpretability using 3-D ECG image and a Grad-CAM ++ method. Methods: We apply a multi-VGG deep convolutional neural network to top-view images of 3-D ECG, which are generated from simply denoised standard 12 leads ECG signals for classification. The multi network method, which separately classifies QRS areas, ST areas, and whole heartbeats, was applied to improve classification performance. Furthermore, the Grad-CAM ++ method was used to provide visually interpretable heatmaps for user's attention to improve network interpretability and assist physicians in MI diagnosisResults: The proposed method achieved 95.65% inter-patient accuracy and exactly perfect inner-patient accuracy in the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) diagnostic ECG database experiment. In the PTB-XL diagnostic ECG database, the proposed method achieved 97.23% inter-patient accuracy. The Grad CAM ++ experiment results also showed that the highlighted areas matched the medical diagnosis criteria for myocardial infarction. Conclusions: Our method demonstrates that 3-D ECG images with AI classification can be efficiently employed for heart disease diagnosis with both high accuracy and visual interpretability.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing pandemic and is placing additional burden on healthcare systems around the world. Timely and effectively detecting the virus can help to reduce the spread of the disease. Although, RT-PCR is still a gold standard for COVID-19 testing, deep learning models to identify the virus from medical images can also be helpful in certain circumstances. In particular, in situations when patients undergo routine X-rays and/or CT-scans tests but within a few days of such tests they develop respiratory complications. Deep learning models can also be used for pre-screening prior to RT-PCR testing. However, the transparency/interpretability of the reasoning process of predictions made by such deep learning models is essential. In this paper, we propose an interpretable deep learning model that uses positive reasoning process to make predictions. We trained and tested our model over the dataset of chest CT-scan images of COVID-19 patients, normal people and pneumonia patients. Our model gives the accuracy, precision, recall and F-score equal to 99.48%, 0.99, 0.99 and 0.99, respectively. (C)& nbsp;2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a general term that implies the use of a computer to model intelligent behavior with minimal human intervention. Al is generally accepted as having started with the invention of robots. The term derives from the Czech word robota, meaning biosynthetic machines used as forced labor. In this field, Leonardo Da Vinci's lasting heritage is today's burgeoning use of robotic-assisted surgery, named after him, for complex urologic and gynecologic procedures. Da Vinci's sketchbooks of robots helped set the stage for this innovation. AI, described as the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, was officially born in 1956. The term is applicable to a broad range of items in medicine such as robotics, medical diagnosis, medical statistics, and human biology up to and including today's "omics". AI in medicine, which is the focus of this review, has two main branches: virtual and physical. The virtual branch includes informatics approaches from deep learning information management to control of health management systems, including electronic health records, and active guidance of physicians in their treatment decisions. The physical branch is best represented by robots used to assist the elderly patient or the attending surgeon. Also embodied in this branch are targeted nanorobots, a unique new drug delivery system. The societal and ethical complexities of these applications require further reflection, proof of their medical utility, economic value, and development of interdisciplinary strategies for their wider application.

AB  - Background and objective: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) has become increasingly important for alleviating X-ray radiation damage. However, reducing the administered radiation dose may lead to degraded CT images with amplified mottle noise and nonstationary streak artifacts. Previous studies have confirmed that deep learning (DL) is promising for improving LDCT imaging. However, most DL-based frameworks are built intuitively, lack interpretability, and suffer from image detail information loss, which has become a general challenging issue.
   Methods: A multiscale reweighted convolutional coding neural network (MRCON-Net) is developed to address the above problems. MRCON-Net is compact and more explainable than other networks. First, inspired by the learning-based reweighted iterative soft thresholding algorithm (ISTA), we extend traditional convolutional sparse coding (CSC) to its reweighted convolutional learning form. Second, we use dilated convolution to extract multiscale image features, allowing our single model to capture the correlations between features of different scales. Finally, to automatically adjust the elements in the feature code to correct the obtained solution, a channel attention (CA) mechanism is utilized to learn appropriate weights.
   Results: The visual results obtained based on the American Association of Physicians in Medicine (AAPM) Challenge and United Image Healthcare (UIH) clinical datasets confirm that the proposed model significantly reduces serious artifact noise while retaining the desired structures. Quantitative results show that the average structural similarity index measurement (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) achieved on the AAPM Challenge dataset are 0.9491 and 40.66, respectively, and the SSIM and PSNR achieved on the UIH clinical dataset are 0.915 and 42.44, respectively; these are promising quantitative results.

AB  - The term Artificial Intelligence (AI) was coined by John McCarthy in 1956 during a conference held on this subject. However, the possibility of machines being able to simulate human behavior and actually think was raised earlier by Alan Turing who developed the Turing test in order to differentiate humans from machines. Since then, computational power has grown to the point of instant calculations and the ability evaluate new data, according to previously assessed data, in real time.Today, AI is integrated into our daily lives in many forms, such as personal assistants (Siri, Alexa, Google assistant etc.), automated mass transportation, aviation and computer gaming. More recently, AI has also begun to be incorporated into medicine to improve patient care by speeding up processes and achieving greater accuracy, opening the path to providing better healthcare overall. Radiological images, pathology slides, and patients' electronic medical records (EMR) are being evaluated by machine learning, aiding in the process of diagnosis and treatment of patients and augmenting physicians' capabilities. Herein we describe the current status of AI in medicine, the way it is used in the different disciplines and future trends.

TI  - Opening the black box of artificial intelligence for clinical decision support: A study predicting stroke outcome
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - State-of-the-art machine learning (ML) artificial intelligence methods are increasingly lever-aged in clinical predictive modeling to provide clinical decision support systems to physicians. Modern ML approaches such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) and tree boosting often perform better than more traditional methods like logistic regression. On the other hand, these modern methods yield a limited understanding of the resulting predictions. However, in the medical domain, understanding of applied models is essential, in particular, when informing clinical decision support. Thus, in recent years, interpretability methods for modern ML methods have emerged to potentially allow explainable predictions paired with high performance. To our knowledge, we present in this work the first explainability comparison of two modern ML methods, tree boosting and multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), to traditional logistic regression methods using a stroke outcome prediction paradigm. Here, we used clinical features to predict a dichotomized 90 days post-stroke modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. For interpretability, we evaluated clinical features' importance with regard to predictions using deep Taylor decomposition for MLP, Shapley values for tree boosting and model coefficients for logistic regression. With regard to performance as measured by Area under the Curve (AUC) values on the test dataset, all models performed comparably: Logistic regression AUCs were 0.83, 0.83, 0.81 for three different regularization schemes; tree boosting AUC was 0.81; MLP AUC was 0.83. Importantly, the interpretability analysis demonstrated consistent results across models by rating age and stroke severity consecutively amongst the most important predictive features. For less important features, some differences were observed between the methods. Our analysis suggests that modern machine learning methods can provide explainability which is compatible with domain knowledge interpretation and traditional method rankings. Future work should focus on replication of these findings in other datasets and further testing of different explainability methods.

LA  - English
AB  - This study proposes a convolutional neural network model trained from scratch to classify and detect the presence of pneumonia from a collection of chest X-ray image samples. Unlike other methods that rely solely on transfer learning approaches or traditional handcrafted techniques to achieve a remarkable classification performance, we constructed a convolutional neural network model from scratch to extract features from a given chest X-ray image and classify it to determine if a person is infected with pneumonia. This model could help mitigate the reliability and interpretability challenges often faced when dealing with medical imagery. Unlike other deep learning classification tasks with sufficient image repository, it is difficult to obtain a large amount of pneumonia dataset for this classification task; therefore, we deployed several data augmentation algorithms to improve the validation and classification accuracy of the CNN model and achieved remarkable validation accuracy.

AB  - Predicting Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) from genomic sequence data has become a significant component of overcoming the AMR challenge, especially given its potential for facilitating more rapid diagnostics and personalised antibiotic treatments. With the recent advances in sequencing technologies and computing power, deep learning models for genomic sequence data have been widely adopted to predict AMR more reliably and error-free. There are many different types of AMR; therefore, any practical AMR prediction system must be able to identify multiple AMRs present in a genomic sequence. Unfortunately, most genomic sequence datasets do not have all the labels marked, thereby making a deep learning modelling approach challenging owing to its reliance on labels for reliability and accuracy. This paper addresses this issue by presenting an effective deep learning solution, Mask-Loss 1D convolution neural network (ML-ConvNet), for AMR prediction on datasets with many missing labels. The core component of ML- ConvNet utilises a masked loss function that overcomes the effect of missing labels in predicting AMR. The proposed ML-ConvNet is demonstrated to outperform state-of-the-art methods in the literature by 10.5%, according to the F1 score. The proposed model's performance is evaluated using different degrees of the missing label and is found to outperform the conventional approach by 76% in the F1 score when 86.68% of labels are missing. Furthermore, the ML-ConvNet was established with an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) pipeline, thereby making it ideally suited for hospital and healthcare settings, where model interpretability is an essential requirement.

AB  - Interpretability is fundamental in healthcare problems and the lack of it in deep learning models is currently the major barrier in the usage of such powerful algorithms in the field. The study describes the implementation of an attention layer for Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network that provides a useful picture on the influence of the several input variables included in the model. A cohort of 10,616 patients with cardiovascular diseases is selected from the MIMIC III dataset, an openly available database of electronic health records (EHRs) including all patients admitted to an ICU at Boston's Medical Centre. For each patient, we consider a 10-length sequence of 1-hour windows in which 48 clinical parameters are extracted to predict the occurrence of death in the next 7 days. Inspired from the recent developments in the field of attention mechanisms for sequential data, we implement a recurrent neural network with LSTM cells incorporating an attention mechanism to identify features driving model's decisions over time. The performance of the LSTM model, measured in terms of AUC, is 0.790 (SD = 0.015). Regard our primary objective, i.e. model interpretability, we investigate the role of attention weights. We find good correspondence with driving predictors of a transparent model (r = 0.611, 95% CI [0.395, 0.763]). Moreover, most influential features identified at the cohort-level emerge as known risk factors in the clinical context. Despite the limitations of study dataset, this work brings further evidence of the potential of attention mechanisms in making deep learning model more interpretable and suggests the application of this strategy for the sequential analysis of EHRs.

AB  - Artificial intelligent (AI) systems for clinical-decision support are an important tool in clinical routine. It has become a crucial diagnostic tool with adequate reliability and interpretability in disease diagnosis and monitoring. Undoubtedly, these models are faced with insufficient data challenges for training, which often directly determines the model's performance. In order word, insufficient data for model training leads to inefficiency in the model built. To overcome this problem, we propose an AI-driven model by transfer learning in accurate diagnosis for medical decision support. Our approach leverages the shortage of data with a pretrained model by training the neural network with a fraction of the new dataset. For this purpose, we utilized the VGG19 network as the backbone network to support our model in integrating known features with the newly learned features for accurate diagnosis and decision making. Integrating this trained model speeds up the training phase and improve the performance of the proposed model. Experimental results show that the proposed model is effective and efficient in diagnosing different medical diseases. As such, we anticipated that this diagnosis tool will ultimately aid in facilitating early treatment of these treatable diseases, which will improve clinical out-comes.

AB  - While deep neural networks (DNNs) and other machine learning models often have higher accuracy than simpler models like logistic regression (LR), they are often considered to be "black box" models and this lack of interpretability and transparency is considered a challenge for clinical adoption. In healthcare, intelligible models not only help clinicians to understand the problem and create more targeted action plans, but also help to gain the clinicians' trust. One method of overcoming the limited interpretability of more complex models is to use Generalized Additive Models (GAMs). Standard GAMs simply model the target response as a sum of univariate models. Inspired by GAMs, the same idea can be applied to neural networks through an architecture referred to as Generalized Additive Models with Neural Networks (GAM-NNs). In this manuscript, we present the development and validation of a model applying the concept of GAM-NNs to allow for interpretability by visualizing the learned feature patterns related to risk of in-hospital mortality for patients undergoing surgery under general anesthesia. The data consists of 59,985 patients with a feature set of 46 features extracted at the end of surgery to which we added previously not included features: total anesthesia case time (1 feature); the time in minutes spent with mean arterial pressure (MAP) below 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, and 65 mmHg during surgery (6 features); and Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) Code Descriptions of the Primary current procedure terminology (CPT) codes (33 features) for a total of 86 features. All data were randomly split into 80% for training (n = 47,988) and 20% for testing (n = 11,997) prior to model development. Model performance was compared to a standard LR model using the same features as the GAM-NN. The data consisted of 59,985 surgical records, and the occurrence of in-hospital mortality was 0.81% in the training set and 0.72% in the testing set. The GAM-NN model with HCUP features had the highest area under the curve (AUC) 0.921 (0.895-0.95). Overall, both GAM-NN models had higher AUCs than LR models, however, had lower average precisions. The LR model without HCUP features had the highest average precision 0.217 (0.136-0.31). To assess the interpretability of the GAM-NNs, we then visualized the learned contributions of the GAM-NNs and compared against the learned contributions of the LRs for the models with HCUP features. Overall, we were able to demonstrate that our proposed generalized additive neural network (GAM-NN) architecture is able to (1) leverage a neural network's ability to learn nonlinear patterns in the data, which is more clinically intuitive, (2) be interpreted easily, making it more clinically useful, and (3) maintain model performance as compared to previously published DNNs.

AB  - Deep learning has demonstrated success in many applications; however, their use in healthcare has been limited due to the lack of transparency into how they generate predictions. Algorithms such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) when applied to Electronic Medical Records (EMR) introduce additional barriers to transparency because of the sequential processing of the RNN and the multi-modal nature of EMR data. This work seeks to improve transparency by: 1) introducing Learned Binary Masks (LBM) as a method for identifying which EMR variables contributed to an RNN model's risk of mortality (ROM) predictions for critically ill children; and 2) applying KernelSHAP for the same purpose. Given an individual patient, LBM and KernelSHAP both generate an attribution matrix that shows the contribution of each input feature to the RNN's sequence of predictions for that patient. Attribution matrices can be aggregated in many ways to facilitate different levels of analysis of the RNN model and its predictions. Presented are three methods of aggregations and analyses: 1) over volatile time periods within individual patient predictions, 2) over populations of ICU patients sharing specific diagnoses, and 3) across the general population of critically ill children.

AB  - Transcription factors (TFs) are essential proteins in regulating the spatiotemporal expression of genes. It is crucial to infer the potential transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) with high resolution to promote biology and realize precision medicine. Recently, deep learning-based models have shown exemplary performance in the prediction of TFBSs at the base-pair level. However, the previous models fail to integrate nucleotide position information and semantic information without noisy responses. Thus, there is still room for improvement. Moreover, both the inner mechanism and prediction results of these models are challenging to interpret. To this end, the Deep Attentive Encoder-Decoder Neural Network (D-AEDNet) is developed to identify the location of TFs-DNA binding sites in DNA sequences. In particular, our model adopts Skip Architecture to leverage the nucleotide position information in the encoder and removes noisy responses in the information fusion process by Attention Gate. Simultaneously, the Transcription Factor Motif Discovery based on Sliding Window (TF-MoDSW), an approach to discover TFs-DNA binding motifs by utilizing the output of neural networks, is proposed to understand the biological meaning of the predicted result. On ChIP-exo datasets, experimental results show that D-AEDNet has better performance than competing methods. Besides, we authenticate that Attention Gate can improve the interpretability of our model by ways of visualization analysis. Furthermore, we confirm that ability of D-AEDNet to learn TFs-DNA binding motifs outperform the state-of-the-art methods and availability of TF-MoDSW to discover biological sequence motifs in TFs-DNA interaction by conducting experiment on ChIP-seq datasets.

AB  - The technology at the heart of the most innovative progress in health care artificial intelligence (AI) is in a subdomain called machine learning (ML), which describes the use of software algorithms to identify patterns in very large datasets. ML has driven much of the progress of health care AI over the past 5 years, demonstrating impressive results in clinical decision support, patient monitoring and coaching, surgical assistance, patient care, and systems management. Clinicians in the near future will find themselves working with information networks on a scale well beyond the capacity of human beings to grasp, thereby necessitating the use of intelligent machines to analyze and interpret the complex interactions between data, patients, and clinical decision makers. However, as this technology becomes more powerful, it also becomes less transparent, and algorithmic decisions are therefore progressively more opaque. This is problematic because computers will increasingly be asked for answers to clinical questions that have no single right answer and that are open-ended, subjective, and value laden. As ML continues to make important contributions in a variety of clinical domains, clinicians will need to have a deeper understanding of the design, implementation, and evaluation of ML to ensure that current health care is not overly influenced by the agenda of technology entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. The aim of this article is to provide a nontechnical introduction to the concept of ML in the context of health care, the challenges that arise, and the resulting implications for clinicians.

AB  - One of the main reasons for disability and premature mortality in the world is diabetes disease, which can cause different sorts of damage to organs such as kidneys, eyes, and heart arteries. The deaths by diabetes are increasing each year, so the need to develop a system that can effectively diagnose diabetes patients becomes inevitable. In this work, an efficient medical decision system for diabetes prediction based on Deep Neural Network (DNN) is presented. Such algorithms are state-of-the-art in computer vision, language processing, and image analysis, and when applied in healthcare for prediction and diagnosis purposes, these algorithms can produce highly accurate results. Moreover, they can be combined with medical knowledge to improve decision-making effectiveness, adaptability, and transparency. A performance comparison between the DNN algorithm and some well-known machine learning techniques as well as the state-of-the-art methods is presented. The obtained results showed that our proposed method based on the DNN technique provides promising performances with an accuracy of 99.75% and an F1-score of 99.66%. This improvement can reduce time, efforts, and labor in healthcare services as well as increasing the final decision accuracy.

TI  - Does Machine Learning Improve Prediction of VA Primary Care Reliance?
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MANAGED CARE
LA  - English
KW  - HEALTH-CARE
KW  - VETERANS
KW  - MEDICARE
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Care System is among the largest integrated health systems in the United States. Many VA enrollees are dual users of Medicare, and little research has examined methods to most accurately predict which veterans will be mostly reliant on VA services in the future. This study examined whether machine learning methods can better predict future reliance on VA primary care compared with traditional statistical methods.
   STUDY DESIGN: Observational study of 83,143 VA patients dually enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare using VA and Medicare administrative databases and the 2012 Survey of Healthcare Experiences of Patients.
   METHODS: The primary outcome was a dichotomous measure denoting whether patients obtained more than 50% of all primary care visits (VA + Medicare) from VA. We compared the performance of 6 candidate models-logistic regression, elastic net regression, decision trees, random forest, gradient boosting machine, and neural network-in predicting 2013 reliance as a function of 61 patient characteristics observed in 2012. We measured performance using the cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) metric. RESULTS: Overall, 72.9% and 74.5% of veterans were mostly VA reliant in 2012 and 2013, respectively. All models had similar average AUROCs, ranging from 0.873 to 0.892. The best-performing model used gradient boosting machine, which exhibited modestly higher AUROC and similar variance compared with standard logistic regression.
   CONCLUSIONS: The modest gains in performance from the best-performing model, gradient boosting machine, are unlikely to outweigh inherent drawbacks, including computational complexity and limited interpretability compared with traditional logistic regression.

AB  - Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive lung disease that is classified into stages based on disease severity. We aimed to characterize the time to progression prior to death in patients with COPD and to generate a temporal visualization that describes signs and symptoms during different stages of COPD progression.
   Methods: We present a two-step approach for visualizing COPD progression at the level of unstructured clinical notes. We included 15,500 COPD patients who both received care within Partners Healthcare's network and died between 2011 and 2017. We first propose a four-layer deep learning model that utilizes a specially configured recurrent neural network to capture irregular time lapse segments. Using those irregular time lapse segments, we created a temporal visualization (the COPD atlas) to demonstrate COPD progression, which consisted of representative sentences at each time window prior to death based on a fraction of theme words produced by a latent Dirichlet allocation model. We evaluated our approach on an annotated corpus of COPD patients' unstructured pulmonary, radiology, and cardiology notes.
   Results: Experiments compared to the baselines showed that our proposed approach improved interpretability as well as the accuracy of estimating COPD progression.
   Conclusions: Our experiments demonstrated that the proposed deep-learning approach to handling temporal variation in COPD progression is feasible and can be used to generate a graphical representation of disease progression using information extracted from clinical notes.

AB  - Mobile telemedicine systems based on the next-generation communication will significantly enhance deep fusion of network automation and federated learning (FL), but data privacy is a paramount issue in sectors like healthcare. This work hence considers FL augments 5G-and-beyond networks by training deep learning (DL) models without the need to exchange raw data. The substantial communication loads imposed on by extensive parameters involved in DL models are managed through adaptive scheduling mechanisms effectively. To address the opaque nature of DL models and to improve the interpretability of FL models, we introduce a convolutional fuzzy rough neural network specifically designed for medical image processing. We also develop a multiobjective memetic evolutionary algorithm to streamline and optimize the neural network architectures. Our comprehensive FL framework integrates smart scheduling, interpretable fuzzy rough logic, and neuroevolution. This framework is shown to improve communication efficiency, increase interpretability of diagnosis with protected privacy, and generate low-complexity neural architectures.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are transforming drug discovery by overcoming traditional challenges like high costs, time-consuming, and frequent failures. AI-driven approaches streamline key phases, including target identification, lead optimization, de novo drug design, and drug repurposing. Frameworks such as deep neural networks (DNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) models have shown promise in identifying drug targets, optimizing delivery systems, and accelerating drug repurposing. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) aid de novo drug design by creating novel drug-like compounds with desired properties. Case studies, such as DDR1 kinase inhibitors designed using generative models and CDK20 inhibitors developed via structure-based methods, highlight AI's ability to produce highly specific therapeutics. Models like SNF-CVAE and DeepDR further advance drug repurposing by uncovering new therapeutic applications for existing drugs. Advanced ML algorithms enhance precision in predicting drug efficacy, toxicity, and ADME-Tox properties, reducing development costs and improving drug-target interactions. AI also supports polypharmacology by optimizing multi-target drug interactions and enhances combination therapy through predictions of drug synergies and antagonisms. In nanomedicine, AI models like CURATE.AI and the Hartung algorithm optimize personalized treatments by predicting toxicological risks and real-time dosing adjustments with high accuracy. Despite its potential, challenges like data quality, model interpretability, and ethical concerns must be addressed. High-quality datasets, transparent models, and unbiased algorithms are essential for reliable AI applications. As AI continues to evolve, it is poised to revolutionize drug discovery and personalized medicine, advancing therapeutic development and patient care.

AB  - This paper contributes with a pragmatic evaluation framework for explainable Machine Learning (ML) models for clinical decision support. The study revealed a more nuanced role for ML explanation models, when these are pragmatically embedded in the clinical context. Despite the general positive attitude of healthcare professionals (HCPs) towards explanations as a safety and trust mechanism, for a significant set of participants there were negative effects associated with confirmation bias, accentuating model over-reliance and increased effort to interact with the model. Also, contradicting one of its main intended functions, standard explanatory models showed limited ability to support a critical understanding of the limitations of the model. However, we found new significant positive effects which repositions the role of explanations within a clinical context: these include reduction of automation bias, addressing ambiguous clinical cases (cases where HCPs were not certain about their decision) and support of less experienced HCPs in the acquisition of new domain knowledge.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Reinforcement learning (RL) represents a significant advancement in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly for complex sequential decision-making challenges. Its capability to iteratively refine decisions makes it ideal for applications in medicine, such as the detection of cervical cancer; a major cause of mortality among women globally. The Pap smear test, a crucial diagnostic tool for cervical cancer, benefits from enhancements in AI, facilitating the development of automated diagnostic systems that improve screening effectiveness. This research introduces RL-Cervix.Net, a hybrid model integrating RL with convolutional neural network (CNN) technologies, aimed at elevating the precision and efficiency of cervical cancer screenings. Methods: RL-Cervix.Net combines the robust ResNet-50 architecture with a reinforcement learning module tailored for the unique challenges of cytological image analysis. The model was trained and validated using three extensive public datasets to ensure its effectiveness under realistic conditions.

AB  - Background and Objective: Cloud-based Deep Learning as a Service (DLaaS) has transformed biomedicine by enabling healthcare systems to harness the power of deep learning for biomedical data analysis. However, privacy concerns emerge when sensitive user data must be transmitted to untrusted cloud servers. Existing privacy-preserving solutions are hindered by significant latency issues, stemming from the computational complexity of inner product operations in convolutional layers and the high communication costs of evaluating nonlinear activation functions. These limitations make current solutions impractical for real-world applications. Methods: In this paper, we address the challenges in mobile cloud-based medical imaging analysis, where users aim to classify private body-related radiological images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model hosted on a cloud server while ensuring data privacy for both parties. We propose PPCNN, a practical and privacy-preserving framework for CNN Inference. It introduces a novel mixed protocol that combines a low-expansion homomorphic encryption scheme with the noise-based masking method. Our framework is designed based on three key ideas: (1) optimizing computation costs by shifting unnecessary and expensive homomorphic multiplication operations to the offline phase, (2) introducing a coefficient-aware packing method to enable efficient homomorphic operations during the linear layer of the CNN, and (3) employing data masking techniques for nonlinear operations of the CNN to reduce communication costs. Results: We implemented PPCNN and evaluated its performance on three real-world radiological image datasets. Experimental results show that PPCNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in mobile cloud scenarios, achieving superior response times and lower usage costs. Conclusions: This study introduces an efficient and privacy-preserving framework for cloud-based medical imaging analysis, marking a significant step towards practical, secure, and trustworthy AI-driven healthcare solutions.

AB  - Electroencephalography is a widely used non-invasive method for monitoring brain electrical activity, critical for diagnosing and managing neurological disorders such as epilepsy. While clinical standards use 21 electrodes to capture comprehensive neural signals, a personalized approach can enhance performance by selecting patient-specific channels, reducing noise and redundancy. This study introduces an innovative, lightweight deep learning system optimized for real-time seizure detection in personalized wearable devices. The system uses an efficient Convolutional Neural Network that processes data from just two channels. These channels are automatically selected using a data-driven mechanism that identifies the most informative scalp regions based on each patient's unique seizure patterns. The proposed approach ensures high reliability, even with small datasets, and improves interpretability for clinicians by overcoming the limitations of more complex methods. The tailored channel selection boosts detection accuracy and ensures robust performance across different seizure types while reducing the computational burden typical of multi-electrode systems. Validation on the publicly available CHB-MIT dataset achieved an average balanced accuracy of 0.83 and a false-positive rate of approximately 0.1/h. The system's performance matches, and in some cases outperforms, state-of-the-art systems that use four fixed channels in temporal regions, demonstrating the potential of two-channel wearable solutions, specifically with a non-negligible 30% reduction in the false-positive rate. This interpretable, patient-specific method enables the development of personalized, efficient, and compact wearable devices for reliable seizure detection in everyday life.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and breast cancer (BC) are among the leading causes of mortality worldwide, necessitating accurate and interpretable machine learning (ML) models for early diagnosis. Existing approaches often rely on data augmentation techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to address class imbalance, but these methods can introduce noise, distort feature distributions, and reduce model interpretability. To overcome these challenges, we propose two augmentation-free neural network models, Double Conglomerate (D-CongNet) and Triple Conglomerate (T-CongNet), which integrate Polynomial feature transformations and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) for feature analysis, ensuring both high predictive performance and robust interpretability. We evaluate our models on two publicly available datasets: the UCI Heart Disease dataset for CVD prediction and the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset for BC classification. D-CongNet and T-CongNet achieve state-of-the-art performance without augmentation, with 86.96% accuracy, 88.79% sensitivity, and 84.42% specificity for CVD, and 97.37% accuracy, 97.67% sensitivity, and 97.18% specificity for BC. Our models also provide clinically meaningful explanations, identifying MaxHR-ST_Slope as a critical predictor for CVD and concave points_mean-area_worst for BC, aligning with established medical knowledge. By eliminating the need for augmentation, D-CongNet and T-CongNet offer a transparent and reliable alternative to traditional oversampling methods, ensuring robust decision-making in medical applications. Our results demonstrate that augmentation-free ML models can achieve both high accuracy and interpretability, making them valuable tools for healthcare professionals seeking explainable AI-driven diagnostics.

AB  - Medical decision making increasingly relies on machine learning algorithms to analyze complex patient data and provide recommendations. However, the lack of interpretability in "black box" models has limited their adoption in clinical practice, which demands transparency and justification. Echo State Networks (ESNs), a recurrent neural network architecture, have shown promise for medical Decision Support Systems (DSS) applications due to their accuracy in modeling time series data, such as physiological signals. However, conventional ESNs suffer from a lack of interpretability, which limits their usefulness for clinical decisions. This study proposes a multilevel framework to optimize both accuracy and interpretability for improved medical decision support. The framework is specifically designed for EEG data, which represents a non-invasive and continuous recording of brain activity. EEG data is ideal for recording information about the internal state of the brain, which is not always translated by perceptible external manifestations. The framework consists of four components: (1) data preprocessing and optimized feature selection utilizing a filter-based feature importance algorithm, (2) ensemble learning via Ensemble ESNs (E-ESNs) that combines the predictions of multiple ESNs to reduce variance and improve accuracy, (3) Global and Local model explanation techniques to allow users to understand the decisionmaking process and identify the most influential features for each prediction, and (4) decision-making for presenting diagnoses and recommendations. The framework was evaluated on an EEG dataset for stroke prediction, a valuable use case for informed clinical decisions and resource allocation. The results showed that the framework significantly outperformed baseline related works with an accuracy of 96.5% and provides insights into the E-ESN model's predictions. This transparency enhances trust and comprehension among healthcare practitioners. These findings suggest that the proposed framework can be a valuable tool for medical DSS applications.

AB  - The extensive adoption of artificial intelligence in clinical decision support systems requires greater model interpretability. Hence, we introduce EvolveFNN, an interpretable model based on the recurrent neural network that merges fuzzy logic principles with recurrent units. This model is designed to train precise and understandable models using high-dimensional longitudinal electronic health records data. Through supervised learning, our method allows the identification of variable encoding functions and significant rules. To demonstrate performance and capabilities in classification and rule discovery, we first test our method on a simulated dataset. The proposed methods achieve the best model performance compared to other methods, and the rules learned are almost identical to what we used to generate the synthetic data. Furthermore, we showcase a pilot application that proves its potential in the early detection of cardiac event onset. Our proposed algorithm obtains a comparable model performance to vanilla GRU models and remains relatively stable when the prediction window size changes. Examining the rules generated by our proposed model, we find that the extracted rules not only align with clinical practices and existing literature but also provide potential risk factors not explored in the population. The additional experiments on the MIMIC-III benchmark dataset show the algorithm's generalizability. In conclusion, our proposed approach can effectively train accurate, interpretable, and reliable models using large longitudinal electronic health records, offering clinicians valuable insights.

AB  - The evolving field of Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis has greatly benefited from deep learning models for analyzing brain magnetic resonance (MR) images. This study introduces Dynamic GradNet, a novel deep learning model designed to increase diagnostic accuracy and interpretability for multiclass AD classification. Initially, four state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, the self-regulated network (RegNet), residual network (ResNet), densely connected convolutional network (DenseNet), and efficient network (EfficientNet), were comprehensively compared via a unified preprocessing pipeline to ensure a fair evaluation. Among these models, EfficientNet consistently demonstrated superior performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. As a result, EfficientNet was selected as the foundation for implementing Dynamic GradNet. Dynamic GradNet incorporates gradient weighted class activation mapping (GradCAM) into the training process, facilitating dynamic adjustments that focus on critical brain regions associated with early dementia detection. These adjustments are particularly effective in identifying subtle changes associated with very mild dementia, enabling early diagnosis and intervention. The model was evaluated with the OASIS dataset, which contains greater than 80,000 brain MR images categorized into four distinct stages of AD progression. The proposed model outperformed the baseline architectures, achieving remarkable generalizability across all stages. This finding was especially evident in early-stage dementia detection, where Dynamic GradNet significantly reduced false positives and enhanced classification metrics. These findings highlight the potential of Dynamic GradNet as a robust and scalable approach for AD diagnosis, providing a promising alternative to traditional attention-based models. The model's ability to dynamically adjust spatial focus offers a powerful tool in artificial intelligence (AI) assisted precision medicine, particularly in the early detection of neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Background: Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) recurrence remains a pressing clinical challenge, with limited predictive tools available to support early identification and personalized intervention. Predicting recurrence after lumbar disc herniation (LDH) remains clinically important but algorithmically difficult due to extreme class imbalance and low signal-to-noise ratio. Objective: This study proposes a hybrid machine learning framework that integrates supervised classifiers, unsupervised anomaly detection, and decision threshold tuning to predict LDH recurrence using routine clinical data. Methods: A dataset of 977 patients from a Romanian neurosurgical center was used. We trained a deep neural network, random forest, and an autoencoder (trained only on non-recurrence cases) to model baseline and anomalous patterns. Their outputs were stacked into a meta-classifier and optimized via sensitivity-focused threshold tuning. Evaluation was performed via stratified cross-validation and external holdout testing. Results: Baseline models achieved high accuracy but failed to recall recurrence cases (0% sensitivity). The proposed ensemble reached 100% recall internally with a threshold of 0.05. Key predictors included hospital stay duration, L4-L5 herniation, obesity, and hypertension. However, external holdout performance dropped to 0% recall, revealing poor generalization. Conclusions: The ensemble approach enhances detection of rare recurrence cases under internal validation but exhibits poor external performance, emphasizing the challenge of rare-event modeling in clinical datasets. Future work should prioritize external validation, longitudinal modeling, and interpretability to ensure clinical adoption.

AB  - We present a novel methodology for integrating high resolution longitudinal data with the dynamic prediction capabilities of survival models. The aim is two -fold: to improve the predictive power while maintaining the interpretability of the models. To go beyond the black box paradigm of artificial neural networks, we propose a parsimonious and robust semi -parametric approach (i.e., a landmarking competing risks model) that combines routinely collected low -resolution data with predictive features extracted from a convolutional neural network, that was trained on high resolution time -dependent information. We then use saliency maps to analyze and explain the extra predictive power of this model. To illustrate our methodology, we focus on healthcare -associated infections in patients admitted to an intensive care unit.

AB  - In the rapidly evolving domain of medical technology, the utilization of sophisticated algorithms for deciphering transcriptional data has emerged as a critical aspect, especially in the oncology sector. These algorithms, drawing upon methodologies from fields such as natural language processing and advanced image analysis, can significantly enhance the accuracy in predicting cancer-related molecular states. Notably, Transformer models, renowned for their proficiency in handling extensive datasets, are now being adapted for breakthroughs in medical diagnostics or in stratifying patients according to prognostic levels. Our study contributes to the field of precision medicine by integrating Transformer-based learning, exemplified by the Geneformer model, with explainable AI techniques. These techniques are employed to find out the input variables (genes resulting from genomic transcription) most correlated with the decisions of neural network systems. This insight, a key goal in genomic research, aims to select the most relevant gene subset for each specific task in which a neural network is employed. This selection approach has proven to be effective in two classification tasks: cell type classification and breast cancer type classification. Such effectiveness has been demonstrated even across various cohorts of patients. When applying Geneformer-like architecture analyses solely to the selected gene subsets, the outcomes either maintain their accuracy or significantly improve. This approach, aims not only to contribute to the identification of vital genetic markers in cancer genomics, but also to exemplify the adaptability of AI models to different datasets, marking a significant step towards the development of accurate and universally applicable diagnostic tools for precision medicine.

AB  - The rapid integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into healthcare has enhanced diagnostic accuracy; however, patient engagement and satisfaction remain significant challenges that hinder the widespread acceptance and effectiveness of AI-driven clinical tools. This study introduces CareAssist-GPT, a novel AI-assisted diagnostic model designed to improve both diagnostic accuracy and the patient experience through real-time, understandable, and empathetic communication. CareAssist-GPT combines high-resolution X-ray images, real-time physiological vital signs, and clinical notes within a unified predictive framework using deep learning. Feature extraction is performed using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), gated recurrent units (GRUs), and transformer-based NLP modules. Model performance was evaluated in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and response time, alongside patient satisfaction through a structured user feedback survey. CareAssist-GPT achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 95.8%, improving by 2.4% over conventional models. It reported high precision (94.3%), recall (93.8%), and specificity (92.7%), with an AUC-ROC of 0.97. The system responded within 500 ms-23.1% faster than existing tools-and achieved a patient satisfaction score of 9.3 out of 10, demonstrating its real-time usability and communicative effectiveness. CareAssist-GPT significantly enhances the diagnostic process by improving accuracy and fostering patient trust through transparent, real-time explanations. These findings position it as a promising patient-centered AI solution capable of transforming healthcare delivery by bridging the gap between advanced diagnostics and human-centered communication.

AB  - Predicting epileptic seizures presents a substantial difficulty in healthcare, with considerable implications for enhancing patient outcomes and quality of life. This paper presents an explainable artificial intelligence (AI) that integrates a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). The approach facilitates precise and interpretable seizure prediction utilising electroencephalography (EEG) inputs. The suggested 1D-CNN model with SHAP attains superior performance, exhibiting an accuracy of 98.14% and an F1-score of 98.30% with feature-level explainability and high clinical insight using the CHB-MIT dataset. Through the computation and aggregation of SHAP values across time, we identified the most significant EEG channels, specifically "P7-O1" and "P3-O1", as essential for seizure detection. This transparency is crucial for building practitioners' trust and acceptance of the use of artificial intelligence-based solutions in the clinical domain. The technique can readily operate within portable EEG structures and hospital monitoring systems, triggering real-time alerts to patients. The outcome provides a timely intervention that could include anything from medication adjustments to responses in emergencies, preventing potential injury and improving safety. So, SHAP not only explains the model's predictions, but it also check and improve how much it relies on certain features, which makes it more reliable. Additionally, SHAP's interpretability aids physicians in understanding why the model arrived at its conclusions, increasing trust in the predictions and encouraging its extensive utilisation in diagnostic processes.

AB  - Thyroid disease classification is a critical challenge in medical diagnostics, requiring accurate differentiation between hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and normal thyroid function. This study introduces an advanced machine learning approach that integrates generative adversarial networks (GANs) for data augmentation and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) for classification. Various machine learning models including logistic regression, random forest, support vector machines, multilayer perceptrons, and KANs were trained and evaluated. The results indicate that the application of GAN-based data augmentation has significantly improved classification accuracy, particularly for minority classes. Specifically, the KAN model achieved an accuracy of 98.68% and random forest (RF) F1-score of 98.00%, outperforming traditional neural network applications. The results demonstrate that GAN-augmented datasets significantly improve classification accuracy, and the KAN model achieves superior performance and generalization capabilities compared to traditional neural networks. Additionally, the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) were employed to ensure model transparency and interpretability. These explainability methods highlight thyroid stimulating hormone as the most prominent feature in classification, further supporting its clinical utility in the diagnosis of thyroid diseases. The findings underscore the potential of advanced AI-driven techniques in improving thyroid disease classification, addressing class imbalance, and enhancing explainability in healthcare applications. By leveraging synthetic data generation, this study provides a feasible framework for actual clinical application, particularly in situations where clinical data are limited or imbalanced. The integration of GANs and KANs enhances diagnostic accuracy while preserving robustness and generalizability to diverse patient populations. Besides, the approach fosters the deployment of explainable AI models in clinical decision support systems so that healthcare practitioners can make improved and more reliable decisions, thus leading to better patient outcomes and resource allocation.

AB  - In this study, we address the inherent challenges in radiotherapy (RT) plan quality assessment (QA). RT, a prevalent cancer treatment, utilizes high-energy beams to target tumors while sparing adjacent healthy tissues. Typically, an RT plan is refined through several QA cycles by experts to ensure it meets clinical and operational objectives before being considered safe for patient treatment. This iterative process tends to eliminate unacceptable plans, creating a significant class imbalance problem for machine learning efforts aimed at automating the classification of RT plans as either acceptable or not. The complexity of RT treatment plans, coupled with the aforementioned class imbalance issue, introduces a generalization problem that significantly hinders the efficacy of traditional binary classification approaches. We introduce a novel one-class classification framework, using an adaptive neural network architecture, that outperforms both traditional binary and standard one-class classification methods in this imbalanced and complex context, despite the inherent disadvantage of not learning from unacceptable plans. Unlike its predecessors, our method enhances anomaly detection for RT plan QA without compromising on interpretability-a critical feature in healthcare applications, where understanding and trust in automated decisions are paramount. By offering clear insights into decision-making processes, our method allows healthcare professionals to quickly identify and address specific deficiencies in RT plans deemed unacceptable, thereby streamlining the QA process and enhancing patient care efficiency and safety.

AB  - The COVID-19 global pandemic caused by the widespread transmission of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has become one of modern history's most challenging issues from a healthcare perspective. At its dawn, still without a vaccine, contagion containment strategies remained most effective in preventing the disease's spread. Patient isolation has been primarily driven by the results of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, but its initial reach was challenged by low availability and high cost, especially in developing countries. As a means of taking advantage of a preexisting infrastructure for respiratory disease diagnosis, researchers have proposed COVID-19 patient screening based on the results of Chest Computerized Tomography (CT) and Chest Radiographs (X-ray). When paired with artificial-intelligence- and deep-learning-based approaches for analysis, early studies have achieved a comparatively high accuracy in diagnosing the disease. Considering the opportunity to further explore these methods, we implement six different Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (Deep CNN) models-VGG16, MobileNetV2, InceptionResNetV2, ResNet50, ResNet101, and VGG19-and use a mixed dataset of CT and X-ray images to classify COVID-19 patients. Preliminary results showed that a modified MobileNetV2 model performs best with an accuracy of 95 +/- 1.12% (AUC = 0.816). Notably, a high performance was also observed for the VGG16 model, outperforming several previously proposed models with an accuracy of 98.5 +/- 1.19% on the X-ray dataset. Our findings are supported by recent works in the academic literature, which also uphold the higher performance of MobileNetV2 when X-ray, CT, and their mixed datasets are considered. Lastly, we further explain the process of feature extraction using Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), which contributes to a better understanding of what features in CT/X-ray images characterize the onset of COVID-19.

AB  - Medical image segmentation is a complex yet one of the most essential tasks for diagnostic procedures such as brain tumor detection. Several 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures have achieved remarkable results in brain tumor segmentation. However, due to the black-box nature of CNNs, the integration of such models to make decisions about diagnosis and treatment is high-risk in the domain of healthcare. It is difficult to explain the rationale behind the model's predictions due to the lack of interpretability. Hence, the successful deployment of deep learning models in the medical domain requires accurate as well as transparent predictions. In this paper, we generate 3D visual explanations to analyze the 3D brain tumor segmentation model by extending a post-hoc interpretability technique. We explore the advantages of a gradient-free interpretability approach over gradient-based approaches. Moreover, we interpret the behavior of the segmentation model with respect to the input Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images and investigate the prediction strategy of the model. We also evaluate the interpretability methodology quantitatively for medical image segmentation tasks. To deduce that our visual explanations do not represent false information, we validate the extended methodology quantitatively. We learn that the information captured by the model is coherent with the domain knowledge of human experts, making it more trustworthy. We use the BraTS-2018 dataset to train the 3D brain tumor segmentation network and perform interpretability experiments to generate visual explanations.

AB  - The application of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques in the medical world is growing, with a range of purposes: from the identification and prediction of possible diseases to patient monitoring and clinical decision support systems. Furthermore, the widespread use of remote monitoring medical devices, under the umbrella of the "Internet of Medical Things" (IoMT), has simplified the retrieval of patient information as they allow continuous monitoring and direct access to data by healthcare providers. However, due to possible issues in real-world settings, such as loss of connectivity, irregular use, misuse, or poor adherence to a monitoring program, the data collected might not be sufficient to implement accurate algorithms. For this reason, data augmentation techniques can be used to create synthetic datasets sufficiently large to train machine learning models. In this work, we apply the concept of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to perform a data augmentation from patient data obtained through IoMT sensors for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) monitoring. We also apply an explainable AI algorithm to demonstrate the accuracy of the synthetic data by comparing it to the real data recorded by the sensors. The results obtained demonstrate how synthetic datasets created through a well-structured GAN are comparable with a real dataset, as validated by a novel approach based on machine learning.

AB  - Building an accurate disease risk prediction model is an essential step in the modern quest for precision medicine. While high-dimensional genomic data provides valuable data resources for the investigations of disease risk, their huge amount of noise and complex relationships between predictors and outcomes have brought tremendous analytical challenges. Deep learning model is the state-of-the-art methods for many prediction tasks, and it is a promising framework for the analysis of genomic data. However, deep learning models generally suffer from the curse of dimensionality and the lack of biological interpretability, both of which have greatly limited their applications. In this work, we have developed a deep neural network (DNN) based prediction modeling framework. We first proposed a groupwise feature importance score for feature selection, where genes harboring genetic variants with both linear and non-linear effects are efficiently detected. We then designed an explainable transfer-learning based DNN method, which can directly incorporate information from feature selection and accurately capture complex predictive effects. The proposed DNN-framework is biologically interpretable, as it is built based on the selected predictive genes. It is also computationally efficient and can be applied to genome-wide data. Through extensive simulations and real data analyses, we have demonstrated that our proposed method can not only efficiently detect predictive features, but also accurately predict disease risk, as compared to many existing methods.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to provide a comparison of performance and explainability of a multitask convolutional deep neuronal network to single -task networks for activity detection in neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD).Methods: From 70 patients (46 women and 24 men) who attended the University Eye Hospital Tubingen, 3762 optical coherence tomography B-scans (right eye = 2011 and left eye = 1751) were acquired with Heidelberg Spectralis, Heidelberg, Germany. B-scans were graded by a retina specialist and an ophthalmology resident, and then used to develop a multitask deep learning model to predict disease activity in neovascular age -related macular degeneration along with the presence of sub-and intraretinal fluid. We used performance metrics for comparison to single-task networks and visualized the deep neural network (DNN)-based decision with t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding and clinically validated saliency mapping techniques.Results: The multitask model surpassed single-task networks in accuracy for activity detection (94.2% vs. 91.2%). The area under the curve of the receiver operating curve was 0.984 for the multitask model versus 0.974 for the single-task model. Furthermore, compared to single-task networks, visualizations via t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding and saliency maps highlighted that multitask networks' decisions for activ-ity detection in neovascular age-related macular degeneration were highly consistent with the presence of both sub-and intraretinal fluid.Conclusions: Multitask learning increases the performance of neuronal networks for predicting disease activity, while providing clinicians with an easily accessible decision control, which resembles human reasoning. Translational Relevance: By improving nAMD activity detection performance and transparency of automated decisions, multitask DNNs can support the translation of machine learning research into clinical decision support systems for nAMD activity detection.

AB  - Simple Summary This paper introduces a novel graph neural network (a hierarchical graph pooling model), SANEpool, to effectively detect core sub-networks of significant genes for predicting the synergy score of drug/drug combinations in cancer. SANEpool successfully addresses the limitations of the un-transparency in the prediction process of previous computational AI models for drug synergy prediction, while providing the superior predictive performance than popular baselines on numerous drug-synergy prediction datasets. The success of SANEpool indicates that significant gene-gene interactions and gene-drug interactions play a crucial role in designing powerful deep learning models to provide accurate prediction and to reveal the mechanism of the synergy (MoS).Abstract Synergistic drug combinations provide huge potentials to enhance therapeutic efficacy and to reduce adverse reactions. However, effective and synergistic drug combination prediction remains an open question because of the unknown causal disease signaling pathways. Though various deep learning (AI) models have been proposed to quantitatively predict the synergism of drug combinations, the major limitation of existing deep learning methods is that they are inherently not interpretable, which makes the conclusions of AI models untransparent to human experts, henceforth limiting the robustness of the model conclusion and the implementation ability of these models in real-world human-AI healthcare. In this paper, we develop an interpretable graph neural network (GNN) that reveals the underlying essential therapeutic targets and the mechanism of the synergy (MoS) by mining the sub-molecular network of great importance. The key point of the interpretable GNN prediction model is a novel graph pooling layer, a self-attention-based node and edge pool (henceforth SANEpool), that can compute the attention score (importance) of genes and connections based on the genomic features and topology. As such, the proposed GNN model provides a systematic way to predict and interpret the drug combination synergism based on the detected crucial sub-molecular network. Experiments on various well-adopted drug-synergy-prediction datasets demonstrate that (1) the SANEpool model has superior predictive ability to generate accurate synergy score prediction, and (2) the sub-molecular networks detected by the SANEpool are self-explainable and salient for identifying synergistic drug combinations.

KW  - HEALTH
AB  - In machine learning (ML), association patterns in the data, paths in decision trees, and weights between layers of the neural network are often entangled due to multiple underlying causes, thus masking the pattern-to-source relation, weakening prediction, and defying explanation. This paper presents a revolutionary ML paradigm: pattern discovery and disentanglement (PDD) that disentangles associations and provides an all-in-one knowledge system capable of (a) disentangling patterns to associate with distinct primary sources; (b) discovering rare/imbalanced groups, detecting anomalies and rectifying discrepancies to improve class association, pattern and entity clustering; and (c) organizing knowledge for statistically supported interpretability for causal exploration. Results from case studies have validated such capabilities. The explainable knowledge reveals pattern-source relations on entities, and underlying factors for causal inference, and clinical study and practice; thus, addressing the major concern of interpretability, trust, and reliability when applying ML to healthcare, which is a step towards closing the AI chasm.

AB  - BackgroundIn the field of biology and medicine, the interpretability and accuracy are both important when designing predictive models. The interpretability of many machine learning models such as neural networks is still a challenge. Recently, many researchers utilized prior information such as biological pathways to develop neural networks-based methods, so as to provide some insights and interpretability for the models. However, the prior biological knowledge may be incomplete and there still exists some unknown information to be explored.ResultsWe proposed a novel method, named PathExpSurv, to gain an insight into the black-box model of neural network for cancer survival analysis. We demonstrated that PathExpSurv could not only incorporate the known prior information into the model, but also explore the unknown possible expansion to the existing pathways. We performed downstream analyses based on the expanded pathways and successfully identified some key genes associated with the diseases and original pathways.ConclusionsOur proposed PathExpSurv is a novel, effective and interpretable method for survival analysis. It has great utility and value in medical diagnosis and offers a promising framework for biological research.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) using deep learning approaches the capabilities of human experts in medical image diagnosis. However, due to liability issues in medical decisions, AI is often relegated to an assistant role. Based on this responsibility constraint, the effective use of AI to assist human intelligence in real-world clinics remains a challenge. Given the significant inter-individual variations in clinical decisions among physicians based on their expertise, AI needs to adapt to individual experts, complementing weaknesses and enhancing strengths. For this adaptation, AI should not only acquire domain knowledge but also understand the specific human experts it assists. This study introduces a meta-model for human-machine cooperation that first evaluates each expert's class-specific diagnostic tendencies using conditional probability, based on which the meta-model adjusts the AI's predictions. This meta-model was applied to ear disease diagnosis using otoendoscopy, highlighting improved performance when incorporating individual diagnostic characteristics, even with limited evaluation data. The highest accuracy was achieved by combining each expert's conditional probabilities with machine classification probability, using optimal weights specific to each individual's overall classification accuracy. This tailored model aims to mitigate potential misjudgments due to psychological effects caused by machine suggestions and to capitalize on the unique expertise of individual clinicians.

AB  - We propose an interpretable and scalable model to predict likely diagnoses at an encounter based on past diagnoses and lab results. This model is intended to aid physicians in their interaction with the electronic health records (EHR). To accomplish this, we retrospectively collected and de-identified EHR data of 2,701,522 patients at Stanford Healthcare over a time period from January 2008 to December 2016. A population-based sample of patients comprising 524,198 individuals (44% M, 56% F) with multiple encounters with at least one frequently occurring diagnosis codes were chosen. A calibrated model was developed to predict ICD-10 diagnosis codes at an encounter based on the past diagnoses and lab results, using a binary relevance based multi-label modeling strategy. Logistic regression and random forests were tested as the base classifier, and several time windows were tested for aggregating the past diagnoses and labs. This modeling approach was compared to a recurrent neural network based deep learning method. The best model used random forest as the base classifier and integrated demographic features, diagnosis codes, and lab results. The best model was calibrated and its performance was comparable or better than existing methods in terms of various metrics, including a median AUROC of 0.904 (IQR [0.838, 0.954]) over 583 diseases. When predicting the first occurrence of a disease label for a patient, the median AUROC with the best model was 0.796 (IQR [0.737, 0.868]). Our modeling approach performed comparably as the tested deep learning method, outperforming it in terms of AUROC (p < 0.001) but underperforming in terms of AUPRC (p < 0.001). Interpreting the model showed that the model uses meaningful features and highlights many interesting associations among diagnoses and lab results. We conclude that the multi-label model performs comparably with RNN based deep learning model while offering simplicity and potentially superior interpretability. While the model was trained and validated on data obtained from a single institution, its simplicity, interpretability and performance makes it a promising candidate for deployment.

AB  - Background: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a widespread disease with only 50%-60% 5-year survival. Individuals with potentially malignant precursor lesions are at high risk.Methods: Survival could be increased by effective, affordable, and simple screening methods, along with a shift from incisional tissue biopsies to non-invasive brush biopsies for cytology diagnosis, which are easy to perform in primary care. Along with the explainable, fast, and objective artificial intelligence characterisation of cells through deep learning, an easy-to-use, rapid, and cost-effective methodology for finding high-risk lesions is achievable. The collection of cytology samples offers the further opportunity of explorative genomic analysis.Results: Our prospective multicentre study of patients with leukoplakia yields a vast number of oral keratinocytes. In addition to cytopathological analysis, whole-slide imaging and the training of deep neural networks, samples are analysed according to a single-cell RNA sequencing protocol, enabling mapping of the entire keratinocyte transcriptome. Mapping the changes in the genetic profile, based on mRNA expression, facilitates the identification of biomarkers that predict cancer transformation.Conclusion: This position paper highlights non-invasive methods for identifying patients with oral mucosal lesions at risk of malignant transformation. Reliable non-invasive methods for screening at-risk individuals bring the early diagnosis of OSCC within reach. The use of biomarkers to decide on a targeted therapy is most likely to improve the outcome. With the large-scale collection of samples following patients over time, combined with genomic analysis and modern machine-learning-based approaches for finding patterns in data, this path holds great promise.

AB  - Opioid overdose (OD) has become a leading cause of accidental death in the United States, and overdose deaths reached a record high during the COVID-19 pandemic. Combating the opioid crisis requires targeting high-need populations by identifying individuals at risk of OD. While deep learning emerges as a powerful method for building predictive models using large scale electronic health records (EHR), it is challenged by the complex intrinsic relationships among EHR data. Further, its utility is limited by the lack of clinically meaningful explainability, which is necessary for making informed clinical or policy decisions using such models. In this paper, we present LIGHTED, an integrated deep learning model combining long short term memory (LSTM) and graph neural networks (GNN) to predict patients' OD risk. The LIGHTED model can incorporate the temporal effects of disease progression and the knowledge learned from interactions among clinical features. We evaluated the model using Cerner's Health Facts database with over 5 million patients. Our experiments demonstrated that the model outperforms traditional machine learning methods and other deep learning models. We also proposed a novel interpretability method by exploiting embeddings provided by GNNs to cluster patients and EHR features respectively, and conducted qualitative feature cluster analysis for clinical interpretations. Our study shows that LIGHTED can take advantage of longitudinal EHR data and the intrinsic graph structure of EHRs among patients to provide effective and interpretable OD risk predictions that may potentially improve clinical decision support.

AB  - In the healthcare domain, trust, confidence, and functional understanding are critical for decision support systems, therefore, presenting challenges in the prevalent use of black-box deep learning (DL) models. With recent advances in deep learning methods for classification tasks, there is an increased use of deep learning in healthcare decision support systems, such as detection and classification of abnormal Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Domain experts seek to understand the functional mechanism of black-box models with an emphasis on understanding how these models arrive at specific classification of patient medical data. In this paper, we focus on ECG data as the healthcare data signal to be analyzed. Since ECG is a one-dimensional time-series data, we target 1D-CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) as the candidate DL model. Majority of existing interpretation and explanations research has been on 2D-CNN models in non-medical domain leaving a gap in terms of explanation of CNN models used on medical time-series data. Hence, we propose a modular framework, CNN Explanations Framework for ECG Signals (CEFEs), for interpretable explanations. Each module of CEFEs provides users with the functional understanding of the underlying CNN models in terms of data descriptive statistics, feature visualization, feature detection, and feature mapping. The modules evaluate a model's capacity while inherently accounting for correlation between learned features and raw signals which translates to correlation between model's capacity to classify and it's learned features. Explainable models such as CEFEs could be evaluated in different ways: training one deep learning architecture on different volumes/amounts of the same dataset, training different architectures on the same data set or a combination of different CNN architectures and datasets. In this paper, we choose to evaluate CEFEs extensively by training on different volumes of datasets with the same CNN architecture. The CEFEs' interpretations, in terms of quantifiable metrics, feature visualization, provide explanation as to the quality of the deep learning model where traditional performance metrics (such as precision, recall, accuracy, etc.) do not suffice.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly used in health and personalized care. However, the adoption of data-driven approaches in many clinical settings has been hampered due to their inability to perform in a reliable and safe manner to leverage accurate and trustworthy diagnoses. A critical and challenging usage scenario for AI is aiding the treatment of cancerous conditions. Providing accurate diagnosis for cancer is a challenging problem in precision oncology. Although machine learning (ML)-based approaches are very effective at cancer susceptibility prediction and subsequent treatment recommendations, ML models can be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Since adversarially weak models can lead to wrong clinical recommendations, such vulnerabilities is critical - especially when AI-guided systems are used to aid medical doctors. Therefore, it is indispensable that healthcare professionals employ trustworthy AI tools for predicting and assessing disease risks and progression. In this paper, we propose an adversary-aware multimodal convolutional autoencoder (MCAE) model for cancer susceptibility prediction from multi-omics data consisting of copy number variations (CNVs), miRNA expression, and gene expression (GE). Based on different representational learning techniques, the MCAE model learns multimodal feature representations from multi-omics data, followed by classifying the patient cohorts into different cancer types on multimodal embedding space that exhibit similar characteristics in end-to-end setting. To make the MCAE model robust to adversaries and to provide consistent diagnosis, we formulate robustness as a property, such that predictions remain stable with regard to small variations in the input. We study different adversarial attacks scenarios and take both proactive and reactive measures (e.g., adversarial retraining and identification of adversarial inputs). Experiment results show that the MCAE model based on latent representation concatenation (LRC) exhibits high confidence at predicting cancer types, giving an average precision and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) scores of 0.9625 and 0.8453, respectively and shows higher robustness when compared with state-of-the-art approaches against different attack scenarios w.r.t. ERM and CLEVER scores. Overall, our study suggests that a well-fitted and adversarially robust model can provide consistent and reliable diagnosis for cancer.

AB  - Background In the big wave of artificial intelligence sweeping the world, machine learning has made great achievements in healthcare in the past few years, however, these methods are only based on correlation, not causation. The particularities of the healthcare determines that the research method must comply with the causality norm, otherwise the wrong intervention measures may bring the patients a lifetime of misfortune. Methods We propose a two-stage prediction method (instance feature selection prediction and causal effect analysis) for instance disease prediction. Feature selection is based on the counterfactual and uses the reinforcement learning framework to design an interpretable qualitative instance feature selection prediction. The model is composed of three neural networks (counterfactual prediction network, fact prediction network and counterfactual feature selection network), and the actor-critical method is used to train the network. Then we take the counterfactual prediction network as a structured causal model and improve the neural network attribution algorithm based on gradient integration to quantitatively calculate the causal effect of selection features on the output results. Results The results of our experiments on synthetic data, open source data and real medical data show that our proposed method can provide qualitative and quantitative causal explanations for the model while giving prediction results. Conclusions The experimental results demonstrate that causality can further explore more essential relationships between variables and the prediction method based on causal feature selection and effect analysis can build a more reliable disease prediction model.

AB  - There has been an amplified focus on and benefit from the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging applications. However, deep learning approaches involve training with massive amounts of annotated data in order to guarantee generalization and achieve high accuracies. Gathering and annotating large sets of training images require expertise which is both expensive and time-consuming, especially in the medical field. Furthermore, in health care systems where mistakes can have catastrophic consequences, there is a general mistrust in the black-box aspect of AI models. In this work, we focus on improving the performance of medical imaging applications when limited data is available while focusing on the interpretability aspect of the proposed AI model. This is achieved by employing a novel transfer learning framework, progressive transfer learning, an automated annotation technique and a correlation analysis experiment on the learned representations. Progressive transfer learning helps jump-start the training of deep neural networks while improving the performance by gradually transferring knowledge from two source tasks into the target task. It is empirically tested on the wrist fracture detection application by first training a general radiology network RadiNet and using its weights to initialize RadiNet(wrist), that is trained on wrist images to detect fractures. Experiments show that RadiNet(wrist) achieves an accuracy of 87% and an AUC ROC of 94% as opposed to 83% and 92% when it is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. This improvement in performance is investigated within an explainable AI framework. More concretely, the learned deep representations of RadiNet(wrist) are compared to those learned by the baseline model by conducting a correlation analysis experiment. The results show that, when transfer learning is gradually applied, some features are learned earlier in the network. Moreover, the deep layers in the progressive transfer learning framework are shown to encode features that are not encountered when traditional transfer learning techniques are applied. In addition to the empirical results, a clinical study is conducted and the performance of RadiNet(wrist) is compared to that of an expert radiologist. We found that RadiNet(wrist) exhibited similar performance to that of radiologists with more than 20 years of experience. This motivates follow-up research to train on more data to feasibly surpass radiologists' performance, and investigate the interpretability of AI models in the healthcare domain where the decision-making process needs to be credible and transparent.

AB  - With the increasing demand for digital products, processes and services the research area of automatic detection of signal outliers in streaming data has gained a lot of attention. The range of possible applications for this kind of algorithms is versatile and ranges from the monitoring of digital machinery and predictive maintenance up to applications in analyzing big data healthcare sensor data. In this paper we present a method for detecting anomalies in streaming multivariate times series by using an adapted evolving Spiking Neural Network. As the main components of this work we contribute (1) an alternative rank-order-based learning algorithm which uses the precise times of the incoming spikes for adjusting the synaptic weights, (2) an adapted, realtime-capable and efficient encoding technique for multivariate data based on multi-dimensional Gaussian Receptive Fields and (3) a continuous outlier scoring function for an improved interpretability of the classifications. Spiking neural networks are extremely efficient when it comes to process time dependent information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a synthetic dataset based on the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark with various anomaly types. We compare our algorithm to other streaming anomaly detecting algorithms and can prove that our algorithm performs better in detecting anomalies while demanding less computational resources for processing high dimensional data.

AB  - A robust value- and time-continuous emotion recognition has enormous potential benefits within healthcare. For example, within mental health, a real-time patient monitoring system capable of accurately inferring a patient's emotional state could help doctors make an appropriate diagnosis and treatment plan. Such interventions could be vital in terms of ensuring a higher quality of life for the patient involved. To make such tools a reality, the associated machine learning systems need to be fast, robust and generalisable. In this regard, we present herein, a novel emotion recognition system consisting of the shallowest realisable Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. We draw insights from visualisations of the trained filter weights and the facial action unit (FAU) activations, i. e. the inputs to the model, of the participants featured in the inthe-wild, spontaneous video-chat sessions of the SEWA corpus. Further, we demonstrate the generalisablity of this approach on the German, Hungarian, and Chinese cultures available in this corpus. The obtained cross-cultural performance is a testimony to the universality of FAUs in expression and understanding of the human affective behaviours. These learnings were moderately consistent with the human perception of emotional expression. The practicality of the proposed approach is also demonstrated in another key healthcare applications; pain intensity prediction. Key results from these experiments highlight the transparency of the shallow CNN structure. As FAU can be extracted in near real-time, and because the models we developed are exceptionally shallow, this study paves the way for a robust, cross-cultural, end-to-end, in-the-wild, explainable real-time affect and pain prediction, that is value- and time-continuous.

AB  - eXplainable AI (XAI) involves two intertwined but separate challenges: the development of techniques to extract explanations from black-box AI models and the way such explanations are presented to users, i.e., the explanation user interface. Despite its importance, the second aspect has received limited attention so far in the literature. Effective AI explanation interfaces are fundamental for allowing human decision-makers to take advantage and oversee high-risk AI systems effectively. Following an iterative design approach, we present the first cycle of prototyping-testing-redesigning of an explainable AI technique and its explanation user interface for clinical Decision Support Systems (DSS). We first present an XAI technique that meets the technical requirements of the healthcare domain: sequential, ontology-linked patient data, and multi-label classification tasks. We demonstrate its applicability to explain a clinical DSS, and we design a first prototype of an explanation user interface. Next, we test such a prototype with healthcare providers and collect their feedback with a two-fold outcome: First, we obtain evidence that explanations increase users' trust in the XAI system, and second, we obtain useful insights on the perceived deficiencies of their interaction with the system, so we can re-design a better, more human-centered explanation interface.

AB  - Artificial intelligence models encounter significant challenges due to their black-box nature, particularly in safety-critical domains such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous vehicles. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) addresses these challenges by providing explanations for how these models make decisions and predictions, ensuring transparency, accountability, and fairness. Existing studies have examined the fundamental concepts of XAI, its general principles, and the scope of XAI techniques. However, there remains a gap in the literature as there are no comprehensive reviews that delve into the detailed mathematical representations, design methodologies of XAI models, and other associated aspects. This paper provides a comprehensive literature review encompassing common terminologies and definitions, the need for XAI, beneficiaries of XAI, a taxonomy of XAI methods, and the application of XAI methods in different application areas. The survey is aimed at XAI researchers, XAI practitioners, AI model developers, and XAI beneficiaries who are interested in enhancing the trustworthiness, transparency, accountability, and fairness of their AI models.

This research offers a ground-breaking application of transparent strategies to BCI, promoting openness and confidence in brain-computer interactions and taking inspiration from Grad-CAM (Gradientweighted Class Activation Mapping) based Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methodology. The landscape of healthcare diagnostics is about to be redefined by the integration of various technologies, especially when it comes to illnesses related to the brain. New method: A novel approach has been proposed in this study comprising of Xception architecture which is trained on imagenet database following transfer learning process for extraction of significant features from magnetic resonance imaging dataset acquired from publicly available distinct sources as an input and linear support vector machine has been used for distinguishing distinct classes.Afterwards, gradient-weighted class activation mapping has been deployed as the foundation for explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for generating informative heatmaps, representing spatial localization of features which were focused to achieve model's predictions. Results: Thus, the proposed model not only provides accurate outcomes but also provides transparency for the predictions generated by the Xception network to diagnose presence of abnormal tissues and avoids overfitting issues. Hyperparameters along with performance-metrics are also obtained while validating the proposed network on unseen brain MRI scans to ensure effectiveness of the proposed network. Comparison with existing methods and conclusions: The integration of Grad-CAM based explainable artificial intelligence with deep neural network namely Xception offers a significant impact in diagnosing brain tumor disease while highlighting the specific regions of input brain MRI images responsible for making predictions. In this study, the proposed network results in 98.92% accuracy, 98.15% precision, 99.09% sensitivity, 98.18% specificity and 98.91% dice-coefficient while identifying presence of abnormal tissues in the brain. Thus, Xception model trained on distinct dataset following transfer learning process offers remarkable diagnostic accuracy and linear support vector act as a classifier to provide efficient classification among distinct classes. In addition, the deployed explainable artificial intelligence approach helps in revealing the reasoning behind predictions made by deep neural network having black-box nature and provides a clear perspective to assist medical experts in achieving trustworthiness and transparency while diagnosing brain tumor disease in the smart healthcare

AB  - In this study, we introduce a novel approach that integrates interpretability techniques from both traditional machine learning (ML) and deep neural networks (DNN) to quantify feature importance using global and local interpretation methods. Our method bridges the gap between interpretable ML models and powerful deep learning (DL) architectures, providing comprehensive insights into the key drivers behind model predictions, especially in detecting outliers within medical data. We applied this method to analyze COVID-19 pandemic data from 2020, yielding intriguing insights. We used a dataset consisting of individuals who were tested for COVID-19 during the early stages of the pandemic in 2020. The dataset included self-reported symptoms and test results from a wide demographic, and our goal was to identify the most important symptoms that could help predict COVID-19 infection accurately. By applying interpretability techniques to both machine learning and deep learning models, we aimed to improve understanding of symptomatology and enhance early detection of COVID-19 cases. Notably, even though less than 1% of our cohort reported having a sore throat, this symptom emerged as a significant indicator of active COVID-19 infection, appearing 7 out of 9 times in the top four most important features across all methodologies. This suggests its potential as an early symptom marker. Studies have shown that individuals reporting sore throat may have a compromised immune system, where antibody generation is not functioning correctly. This aligns with our data, which indicates that 5% of patients with sore throats required hospitalization. Our analysis also revealed a concerning trend of diminished immune response post-COVID infection, increasing the likelihood of severe cases requiring hospitalization. This finding underscores the importance of monitoring patients post-recovery for potential complications and tailoring medical interventions accordingly. Our study also raises critical questions about the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in individuals presenting with sore throat as a symptom. The results suggest that booster shots might be necessary for this population to ensure adequate immunity, given the observed immune response patterns. The proposed method not only enhances our understanding of COVID-19 symptomatology but also demonstrates its broader utility in medical outlier detection. This research contributes valuable insights to ongoing efforts in creating interpretable models for COVID-19 management and vaccine optimization strategies. By leveraging feature importance and interpretability, these models empower physicians, healthcare workers, and researchers to understand complex relationships within medical data, facilitating more informed decision-making for patient care and public health initiatives.

AB  - Mental health is a term often confused by individuals depending upon one's experiences and the environment in which they have grown. While few controversies and taboo make it difficult for some people to be prepared to comprehensively examine this topic. However, people should not lose hope for they may seek solace in alternative means such as analyzing one's daily practices as people's habits can be predictive of the level of mental stress they experience. This research paper examines the notion that mental health is instrumental toward a person's total health, somatically devoid, which many people ignore in their quest to offer more attention toward the physical aspect of health. It examines myths about mental illnesses, especially the fact that many people consider sullen emotions to be ordinary and therefore stigmatizing the afflicted to loneliness. This research promotes seeking early intervention and stigma-free discussions about emotional disorders and disorders as a way to promote self-appreciation and courageously seeking help. The work examines the transformative impact of AI in modern healthcare and its application in medical imaging, mental health informatics and clinical decision-support systems. Understanding about how AI advancements like machine learning(ML), deep learning (DL), and natural language processing(NLP), and eXplainable AI(XAI) can help in improving treatment outcomes, enhance diagnostic accuracy and optimize clinical decision support systems. The paper aims at comparing the performance of ensemble machine learning techniques such as stacking, bagging, and boosting, with boosting methods like XGBoost achieving an impressive 94% accuracy. Additionally, neural networks and deep neural networks were applied, yielding better results of 93.4% and 97.50%, respectively. This integrated approach aims to enhance awareness and understanding of mental health issues while promoting proactive support and intervention measures. These models are then combined with eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to give users personalized suggestions based on detected mental health conditions, along with a clear diagnostic report.

AB  - With the advent of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) empowered applications for critical applications like healthcare, the questions about liability, trust, and interpretability of their outputs are raising. The black-box nature of various DL models is a roadblock to clinical utilization. Therefore, to gain the trust of clinicians and patients, we need to provide explanations about the decisions of models. With the promise of enhancing the trust and transparency of black-box models, researchers are in the phase of maturing the field of eXplainable ML (XML). In this paper, we provided a comprehensive review of explainable and interpretable ML techniques for various healthcare applications. Along with highlighting security, safety, and robustness challenges that hinder the trustworthiness of ML, we also discussed the ethical issues arising because of the use of ML/DL for healthcare. We also describe how explainable and trustworthy ML can resolve all these ethical problems. Finally, we elaborate on the limitations of existing approaches and highlight various open research problems that require further development.

AB  - A high growth rate in network traffic and the complexity of cyber threats have made it necessary to create more effective and flexible intrusion detection systems. Most traditional Network-based Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) can become weak at detecting new patterns of attacks due to the use of obsolete data or traditional machine learning models. To overcome the mentioned constraints, the current research presents a new deep learning solution that combines Sequential Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation unit with an Extra Tree Classifier feature selection procedure. The proposed model is trained and tested on the new rich and up-to-date UNSW-NB15 set, which provides a realistic reflection of the real-life network traffic and attack vectors. The interesting novelty of this study is the tactical use of ReLU-based DNN combined with feature optimization through the Extra Tree Classifier, which not only overcomes general problems like vanishing gradients and overfitting but also greatly increases the interpretability of the model and the efficiency of its computation. This dimensional reduction of the feature space (43 to only 8 highly relevant features) retains the high accuracy of the model but with better inference speed, which is a crucial aspect of the real-time deployment of NIDS. The results show that with the Sequential DNN approach, the binary class (0 for normal and 1 for attack records) achieved 97.93% accuracy, 97% Precision, 97% Recall and 97% F1-score. Furthermore, the detailed experimental testing, such as ROC curves and Confusion Matrices, confirmed that the Sequential DNN performed well in comparison to other Existing Studies. These findings underscore the effectiveness of deep learning architectures enhanced with optimized feature selection in detecting network intrusions, making the proposed system a promising solution for securing critical infrastructure in sectors such as finance, healthcare, and government networks.

AB  - This narrative review presents a comprehensive and state-of-the-art synthesis of how machine learning (ML) is transforming public health through enhanced prediction, personalized treatment, real-time surveillance, and intelligent resource optimization. Drawing from 170 peer-reviewed studies published up to 2024/2025, this work uniquely integrates cross-domain insights spanning disease outbreak forecasting, genomic data analysis, personalized medicine, mental health monitoring, and public health infrastructure planning. The novelty of this review lies in its multidimensionality. It merges technical efficacy, ethical challenges, and future trends into a unified narrative. Our findings show substantial performance gains across domains: for example, ML models such as LightGBM, GRU neural networks, and LSTM achieved disease prediction accuracies ranging from 88 to 95%. In genomics, ML methods enabled nuanced disease subtype discovery and improved the accuracy of cancer risk assessment and pharmacogenomic modeling. Mental health prediction systems based on NLP and wearable data delivered up to 91% accuracy in stress and depression detection, while hospital resource forecasting models using deep learning minimized errors in predicting emergency admissions. Ethically, this review surfaces critical issues, including algorithmic bias, data privacy concerns in mental health analytics, and the interpretability of black-box models used in outbreak surveillance. A forward-looking discussion identifies future priorities such as the integration of multi-omics data, deployment of explainable AI, and equitable data inclusion frameworks. This review stands out by not only cataloguing applications but also offering a systems-level perspective on how ML can equitably and ethically scale to support public health strategies globally. It is among the first narrative reviews to concurrently evaluate ML's predictive power, ethical constraints, and domain-specific improvements across all core pillars of public health.

AB  - State-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) methods are progressively strengthened in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) pulse palpation, aiding physicians to make comprehensive preliminary clinical decisions through non-invasive diagnostics. One of the well-known proven examinations i.e., hesitant pulse wave diagnosis, is a sign that the blood circulation of a person is sluggish. This examination provides a preliminary diagnosis for physiological problems. Modern AI methods such as artificial neural networks achieve better performance than traditional methods; however, the final decision of such examination lacks of interpretability. In clinical situations, patients need an easy-to-understand diagnosis to be provided for selecting appropriate clinical treatment. Therefore, this study presents feature extraction and clinical decision support systems based on Pulse-Line Intersection (PLI) and eXplainability AI (XAI) methods. The pulses were recorded from 46 patients in six different measurement points for six seconds. In addition, a comparison of several AI methods was provided to classify hesitant and normal pulse. The contribution of each feature in the classification process was analyzed by unboxing each predictive intelligence model.

AB  - In recent years, deep learning has been the key driver of breakthrough developments in computational pathology and other image based approaches that support medical diagnosis and treatment. The underlying neural networks as inherent black boxes lack transparency and are often accompanied by approaches to explain their output. However, formally defining explainability has been a notorious unsolved riddle. Here, we introduce a hypothesis-based framework for falsifiable explanations of machine learning models. A falsifiable explanation is a hypothesis that connects an intermediate space induced by the model with the sample from which the data originate. We instantiate this framework in a computational pathology setting using hyperspectral infrared microscopy. The intermediate space is an activation map, which is trained with an inductive bias to localize tumor. An explanation is constituted by hypothesizing that activation corresponds to tumor and associated structures, which we validate by histological staining as an independent secondary experiment.

AB  - Skin Cancer is an extensive and possibly dangerous disorder that requires early detection for effective treatment. Add specific global statistics on skin cancer prevalence and mortality to emphasize the importance of early detection. Example: "Skin cancer accounts for 1 in 5 diagnosed cancers globally, with melanoma causing over 60,000 deaths annually. Manual skin cancer screening is both time-intensive and expensive. Deep learning (DL) techniques have shown exceptional performance in various applications and have been applied to systematize skin cancer diagnosis. However, training DL models for skin cancer diagnosis is challenging due to limited available data and the risk of overfitting. Traditionally approaches have High computational costs, a lack of interpretability, deal with numerous hyperparameters and spatial variation have always been problems with machine learning (ML) and DL. An innovative method called adaptive learning has been developed to overcome these problems. In this research, we advise an intelligent computer-aided system for automatic skin cancer diagnosis using a two-stage transfer learning approach and Pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs are well-suited for learning hierarchical features from images. Annotated skin cancer photographs are utilized to detect ROIs and reset the initial layer of the pre-trained CNN. The lower-level layers learn about the characteristics and patterns of lesions and unaffected areas by fine-tuning the model. To capture high-level, global features specific to skin cancer, we replace the fully connected (FC) layers, responsible for encoding such features, with a new FC layer based on principal component analysis (PCA). This unsupervised technique enables the mining of discriminative features from the skin cancer images, effectively mitigating overfitting concerns and letting the model adjust structural features of skin cancer images, facilitating effective detection of skin cancer features. The system shows great potential in facilitating the initial screening of skin cancer patients, empowering healthcare professionals to make timely decisions regarding patient referrals to dermatologists or specialists for further diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Our advanced adaptive fine-tuned CNN approach for automatic skin cancer diagnosis offers a valuable tool for efficient and accurate early detection. By leveraging DL and transfer learning techniques, the system has the possible to transform skin cancer diagnosis and improve patient outcomes.

AB  - Objective: In Long-Term Monitoring (LTM), noise significantly impacts the quality of the electrocardiogram (ECG), posing challenges for accurate diagnosis and time-consuming analysis. The clinical severity of noise refers to the difficulty in interpreting the clinical content of the ECG, in contrast to the traditional approach based on quantitative severity. In a previous study, we trained Machine Learning (ML) algorithms using a data repository labeled according to the clinical severity. In this work, we explore Deep Learning (DL) models in the same database to design architectures that provide explainability of the decision making process. Methods: We have developed two sets of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): a 1-D CNN model designed from scratch, and pre-trained 2-D CNNs fine-tuned through transfer learning. Additionally, we have designed two Autoencoder (AE) architectures to provide model interpretability by exploiting the data regionalization in the latent spaces. Results: The DL systems yield superior classification performance than the previous ML approaches, achieving an F1-score up to 0.84in the test set considering patient separation to avoid intra-patient overfitting. The interpretable architectures have shown similar performance with the advantage of qualitative explanations. Conclusions: The integration of DL and interpretable systems has proven to be highly effective in classifying clinical noise in LTM ECG recordings. This approach can enhance clinicians' confidence in clinical decision support systems based on learning methods, a key point for this technology transfer. Significance: The proposed systems can help healthcare professionals to discriminate the parts of the ECG that contain valuable information to provide a diagnosis.

AB  - Because cardiovascular disease (CVD) is still one of the world's leading causes of death, sophisticated predictive models are required for early detection and prevention. This study examined how to make and compare different CVD prediction models using a large dataset that included biochemical, clinical, and demographic information about each person. During the preprocessing stage, we took great care to ensure the data's accuracy and quality. We have utilized a variety of machine learning algorithms such as random forest, logistic regression, support vector machines, and deep learning neural networks. We assessed the performance of these models using the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). Our findings show that while more sophisticated algorithms-especially deep learning models-perform better at spotting possible instances of CVD, more conventional models-such as regression-offer significant predictive power. We also investigated the role that feature selection has in improving the interpretability and efficiency of the model. This study highlights the potential of machine learning to transform CVD prediction and emphasizes the importance of using many forms of data to provide a thorough risk evaluation. Our research adds to the continuing efforts in personalized medicine by providing information on creating more precise and effective predictive tools for cardiovascular health management.

AB  - The demand for transparent and efficient predictive models has grown significantly in the era of big data and complex decision-making. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has emerged as a crucial field to address the "black box" nature of many state-of-the-art models, particularly in domains such as healthcare, where understanding the reasoning behind predictions is essential. However, a key challenge lies in developing models that balance explainability and accuracy while also being computationally efficient. This research introduces a pioneering algorithm that leverages the hierarchical symmetric 2-additive Choquet integral to enhance interpretability and parallelizability in predictive modeling, thereby addressing this critical research gap. Empirical evaluations on diverse datasets, both simulated and real, demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms traditional models in prediction accuracy. This advancement underscores the potential of our algorithm to serve as a versatile tool in the field of XAI, where clarity in the decisionmaking process is paramount. Our work thus presents a significant stride in developing algorithms that are not only accurate but also intuitively understandable, catering to the increasing demand for transparency in artificial intelligence applications.

AB  - Skin cancer is a major global health concern, where early and accurate detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as manual visual inspection and conventional machine learning models, often suffer from subjectivity, high computational costs, and limited annotated data. Althoug deep learning has improved automated skin cancer detection, existing models face challenges like overfitting, insufficient generalization, and complex architectures that limit real-time clinical application. To address these limitations, we propose MAF-DermNet, a deep learning framework that integrates Multi-Scale Attention Fusion (MAF) with depthwise separable convolutions for efficient and accurate skin cancer detection. Our approach enhances data diversity using DCGAN-based synthetic augmentation to improve model robustness. By leveraging multi-resolution inputs and a residual attention block, MAF-DermNet effectively captures subtle lesion features while preserving critical low-level information. Extensive experiments demonstrate exceptional performance, with accuracy exceeding 99.9% and macro F1 scores above 99.5%. In addition to its superior classification capabilities, MAF-DermNet offers enhanced interpretability and computational efficiency, making it well-suited for clinical deployment. Future work will focus on integrating clinical metadata and optimizing the model for diverse healthcare settings to further improve early diagnosis and treatment outcomes.

KW  - image classification
AB  - Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in image classification. However, their "black-box" nature raises concerns about trust and transparency, particularly in high-stakes fields such as healthcare and autonomous systems. While explainable AI (XAI) methods attempt to address these concerns through feature- or concept-based explanations, existing approaches are often limited by the need for manually defined concepts, overly abstract granularity, or misalignment with human semantics. This paper introduces the Enhanced Bottleneck Concept Learner (E-BotCL), a self-supervised framework that autonomously discovers task-relevant, interpretable semantic concepts via a dual-path contrastive learning strategy and multi-task regularization. By combining contrastive learning to build robust concept prototypes, attention mechanisms for spatial localization, and feature aggregation to activate concepts, E-BotCL enables end-to-end concept learning and classification without requiring human supervision. Experiments conducted on the CUB200 and ImageNet datasets demonstrated that E-BotCL significantly enhanced interpretability while maintaining classification accuracy. Specifically, two interpretability metrics, the Concept Discovery Rate (CDR) and Concept Consistency (CC), improved by 0.6104 and 0.4486, respectively. This work advances the balance between model performance and transparency, offering a scalable solution for interpretable decision-making in complex vision tasks.

AB  - Sentiment analysis has gained widespread applications across various domains due to its versatility and practicality. With the increasing availability of data and advancements in machine learning technologies, its utilization is expected to continue expanding. Deep learning (DL)-based sentiment analysis has demonstrated high accuracy and efficiency in numerous application areas, such as marketing, customer service, politics, healthcare, and finance, thereby highlighting its high potential. Despite recent progress, DL-based sentiment analysis methods still face significant challenges, particularly concerning the robustness of sentiment classification and scoring. To address these issues, our study introduces TRALSem, a novel text-centered sentiment analysis framework designed to tackle the unique challenges of sentiment classification and scoring, with a particular focus on enhancing the overall robustness of the model. We conducted extensive experiments on multilingual script datasets, including Chinese and English scripts, as well as the IMDB and SST datasets. The experimental results show that TRALSem significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art sentiment analysis methods. In terms of sentiment classification, it achieves remarkable improvements, far surpassing the previous benchmarks. More importantly, TRALSem substantially enhances the model's robustness, enabling it to maintain stable performance even in the face of complex and noisy data. It also significantly reduces the model's sensitivity to noise data, effectively filtering out interference and providing more reliable and accurate sentiment analysis results. Moreover, it offers better interpretability to users, making the sentiment analysis process and outcomes more understandable and actionable.

AB  - Early diagnosis and accurate treatment planning are critical in dentistry, as impacted mandibular third molars (MTMs) can lead to complications such as infection, pain, and damage to adjacent teeth. Panoramic radiographs (PRs), routinely used in clinical practice, require precise classification of MTM status (erupted or impacted) to support effective surgical decision-making. This study proposes the explainable mandibular third molar YOLO (E-MTMYOLO) architecture, which integrates YOLOv5 with EigenCAM-a eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) technique-to detect and interpret MTMs in PR images. For this purpose, a novel expert-annotated dataset named ExAn-MTM, consisting of 973 PRs, was developed and publicly released in this study. Image preprocessing techniques, including median filtering and gamma correction, were applied to enhance image quality, resulting in a preprocessed dataset. An ablation study was conducted to determine the optimal YOLOv5 variant and hyperparameter configuration. The best performance was achieved using YOLOv5s on the preprocessed dataset, yielding 97.77% accuracy, 95.91% sensitivity, 97.67% precision, 96.78% F1 score, and 99.21% mAP@50. To assess interpretability and clinical relevance, expert dentists from multiple institutions evaluated the model's predictions and the XAI visualizations via MTMX-CDSS, a clinical decision support system developed. The expert evaluations were analyzed using statistical methods, and the results revealed high inter-rater reliability along with strong internal consistency, confirming the clinical applicability of the proposed method. In conclusion, the proposed method not only surpasses existing approaches in core performance metrics and provides clinically validated, interpretable outputs, but also demonstrates the computational scalability and efficiency required for high-performance AI-driven diagnostic systems in dentistry.

AB  - Background Contemporary deep learning approaches show cutting-edge performance in a variety of complex prediction tasks. Nonetheless, the application of deep learning in healthcare remains limited since deep learning methods are often considered as non-interpretable black-box models. However, the machine learning community made recent elaborations on interpretability methods explaining data point-specific decisions of deep learning techniques. We believe that such explanations can assist the need in personalized precision medicine decisions via explaining patient-specific predictions. Methods Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) is a technique to explain decisions of deep learning methods. It is widely used to interpret Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) applied on image data. Recently, CNNs started to extend towards non-Euclidean domains like graphs. Molecular networks are commonly represented as graphs detailing interactions between molecules. Gene expression data can be assigned to the vertices of these graphs. In other words, gene expression data can be structured by utilizing molecular network information as prior knowledge. Graph-CNNs can be applied to structured gene expression data, for example, to predict metastatic events in breast cancer. Therefore, there is a need for explanations showing which part of a molecular network is relevant for predicting an event, e.g., distant metastasis in cancer, for each individual patient. Results We extended the procedure of LRP to make it available for Graph-CNN and tested its applicability on a large breast cancer dataset. We present Graph Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (GLRP) as a new method to explain the decisions made by Graph-CNNs. We demonstrate a sanity check of the developed GLRP on a hand-written digits dataset and then apply the method on gene expression data. We show that GLRP provides patient-specific molecular subnetworks that largely agree with clinical knowledge and identify common as well as novel, and potentially druggable, drivers of tumor progression. Conclusions The developed method could be potentially highly useful on interpreting classification results in the context of different omics data and prior knowledge molecular networks on the individual patient level, as for example in precision medicine approaches or a molecular tumor board.

AB  - Prediction of clinical outcomes using the patient's medical data enhances clinical decision making and improves prognostic accuracy. Deep learning (DL) for medical decision support systems has particularly shown expert level accuracy in predicting clinical outcomes. However, most of these machine learning and Artificial Intelligent (AI) models lack interpretability which causes major trust-related problems in healthcare. This necessitates the need for interpretable AI systems that can explain their decisions. This paper is designed to address the problem of how clinical decision support systems can be designed to be transparent, interpretable and therefore comprehensible for humans. In this view, this paper proposes an attentive hierarchical adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (AH-ANFIS), that combines fuzzy inference in a hierarchical architecture with attention for selecting the important rules. The proposed model benefits from the rule-based structure of ANFIS that enables the user to interpret the abstractions of hidden layers. The hierarchical structure in fuzzy modeling helps to overcome the rule explosion problem that arises with large medical data and improve interpretability. To ensure the improvement of interpretability with hierarchical architecture, an evolutionary algorithm (EA) is used to decompose the input space into an optimal permutation of input subsets which results in subsystems with independent meaning. The attention-based rule selector identifies the most activated rule to select important patient-specific features for predicting the clinical outcome. To verify the performance of the proposed AH-ANFIS and analyze the important features for classification, we perform experiments with two cancer diagnostic datasets. By pruning fuzzy if-then rules using recursive rule elimination (RRE), the complexity of the model is largely reduced while maintaining the performance of the system making it more interpretable.

AB  - Heart strokes are a significant global health concern, profoundly affecting the wellbeing of the population. Many research endeavors have focused on developing predictive models for heart strokes using ML and DL techniques. Nevertheless, prior studies have often failed to bridge the gap between complex ML models and their interpretability in clinical contexts, leaving healthcare professionals hesitant to embrace them for critical decision-making. This research introduces a meticulously designed, effective, and easily interpretable approach for heart stroke prediction, empowered by explainable AI techniques. Our contributions include a meticulously designed model, incorporating pivotal techniques such as resampling, data leakage prevention, feature selection, and emphasizing the model's comprehensibility for healthcare practitioners. This multifaceted approach holds the potential to significantly impact the field of healthcare by offering a reliable and understandable tool for heart stroke prediction. In our research, we harnessed the potential of the Stroke Prediction Dataset, a valuable resource containing 11 distinct attributes. Applying these techniques, including model interpretability measures such as permutation importance and explainability methods like LIME, has achieved impressive results. While permutation importance provides insights into feature importance globally, LIME complements this by offering local and instance-specific explanations. Together, they contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. The combination of these techniques not only aids in understanding the features that drive overall model performance but also helps in interpreting and validating individual predictions. The ANN model has achieved an outstanding accuracy rate of 95%.

AB  - The ability to recognize fine-grained gestures enables several applications in different domains, including healthcare, robotics, remote control, and human-computer interaction. Traditional gesture recognition systems rely on data acquired from cameras, depth sensors, or smart gloves. More recently, techniques for recognizing gestures based on signals acquired by high-density (HD) EMG electrodes worn on the forearm have been proposed. An advantage of these techniques is that they do not rely on the use of external devices, and they are feasible also to people who underwent amputation. Unfortunately, the extraction of complex features from raw HD EMG signals may introduce delays that deter the real-time requirements of the system. To address this issue, in a preliminary investigation we proposed to use graph neural networks for gesture recognition from raw HD EMG data. In this paper, we extend our previous work by exploiting Explainable AI algorithms to automatically refine the graph topology based on the data in order to improve recognition rates and reduce the computational cost. We performed extensive experiments with a large dataset collected from 20 volunteers regarding the execution of 65 fine-grained gestures, comparing our technique with state-of-the-art methods based on handcrafted features and different machine learning algorithms. Experimental results show that our technique outperforms the state of the art in terms of recognition performance while incurring significantly lower computational cost at run-time.

AB  - The exceptionally rapid development of highly flexible, reusable artificial intelligence (AI) models is likely to usher in newfound capabilities in medicine. We propose a new paradigm for medical AI, which we refer to as generalist medical AI (GMAI). GMAI models will be capable of carrying out a diverse set of tasks using very little or no task-specific labelled data. Built through self-supervision on large, diverse datasets, GMAI will flexibly interpret different combinations of medical modalities, including data from imaging, electronic health records, laboratory results, genomics, graphs or medical text. Models will in turn produce expressive outputs such as free-text explanations, spoken recommendations or image annotations that demonstrate advanced medical reasoning abilities. Here we identify a set of high-impact potential applications for GMAI and lay out specific technical capabilities and training datasets necessary to enable them. We expect that GMAI-enabled applications will challenge current strategies for regulating and validating AI devices for medicine and will shift practices associated with the collection of large medical datasets.

AB  - Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have become the key technique to revolutionize the healthcare sector. However, conducting online remote inference is often impractical due to privacy constraints and latency requirements. To enable local computation, researchers have attempted network pruning with minimal accuracy loss or DNN distribution without affecting the performance. Yet, distributed inference can be inefficient due to the energy overhead and fluctuation of communication channels between participants. On the other hand, given that realistic healthcare systems use pre-trained models, local pruning and retraining relying only on the available scarce data is not possible. Even pre-pruned DNNs are limited in their ability to customize to the local load of data and device dynamics. The online pruning of DNN inferences without retraining is viable; however, it was not considered in the literature as most well-known techniques do not perform well without adjustment. In this paper, we propose a novel pruning strategy using Explainable AI (XAI) to enhance the performance of pruned DNNs without retraining, a necessity due to the scarcity and bias of local healthcare data. We combine distribution and pruning techniques to perform online distributed inference assisted by dynamic pruning when needed for highest accuracy. We use Non -Linear Integer Programming (NLP) to formulate our approach as a trade-off between resources and accuracy, and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to relax the problem and adapt to dynamic requirements. Our pruning criterion shows high performance compared to other reference techniques and ability to assist distribution by reducing resource usage while keeping high accuracy.

AB  - Automatic classification of colon and lung cancer images is crucial for early detection and accurate diagnostics. However, there is room for improvement to enhance accuracy, ensuring better diagnostic precision. This study introduces two novel dense architectures (D1 and D2) and emphasizes their effectiveness in classifying colon and lung cancer from diverse images. It also highlights their resilience, efficiency, and superior performance across multiple datasets. These architectures were tested on various types of datasets, including NCT-CRC-HE-100K (set of 100,000 non -overlapping image patches from hematoxylin and eosin (H &E) stained histological images of human colorectal cancer (CRC) and normal tissue), CRC-VAL-HE-7K (set of 7180 image patches from N = 50 patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma, no overlap with patients in NCTCRC-HE-100K), LC25000 (Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological Image), and IQ-OTHNCCD (Iraq -Oncology Teaching Hospital/National Center for Cancer Diseases), showcasing their effectiveness in classifying colon and lung cancers from histopathological and Computed Tomography (CT) scan images. This underscores the multi -modal image classification capability of the proposed models. Moreover, the study addresses imbalanced datasets, particularly in CRC-VAL-HE7K and IQ-OTHNCCD, with a specific focus on model resilience and robustness. To assess overall performance, the study conducted experiments in different scenarios. The D1 model achieved an impressive 99.80 % accuracy on the NCT-CRC-HE-100K dataset, with a Jaccard Index (J) of 0.8371, a Matthew ' s Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.9073, a Cohen ' s Kappa (Kp) of 0.9057, and a Critical Success Index (CSI) of 0.8213. When subjected to 10 -fold cross -validation on LC25000, the D1 model averaged (avg) 99.96 % accuracy (avg J, MCC, Kp, and CSI of 0.9993, 0.9987, 0.9853, and 0.9990), surpassing recent reported performances. Furthermore, the ensemble of D1 and D2 reached 93 % accuracy (J, MCC, Kp, and CSI of 0.7556, 0.8839, 0.8796, and 0.7140) on the IQ-OTHNCCD dataset, exceeding recent benchmarks and aligning with other reported results. Efficiency evaluations were conducted in various scenarios. For instance, training on only 10 % of LC25000 resulted in high accuracy rates of 99.19 % (J, MCC, Kp, and CSI of 0.9840, 0.9898, 0.9898, and 0.9837) (D1) and 99.30 % (J, MCC, Kp, and CSI of 0.9863, 0.9913, 0.9913, and 0.9861) (D2). In NCT-CRC-HE-100K, D2 achieved an impressive 99.53 % accuracy (J, MCC, Kp, and CSI of 0.9906, 0.9946, 0.9946, and 0.9906) with training on only 30 % of the dataset and testing on the remaining 70 %. When tested on CRC-VAL-HE-7K, D1 and D2 achieved 95 % accuracy (J, MCC, Kp, and CSI of 0.8845, 0.9455, 0.9452, and 0.8745) and 96 % accuracy (J, MCC, Kp, and CSI of 0.8926, 0.9504, 0.9503, and 0.8798), respectively, outperforming previously reported results and aligning closely with others. Lastly, training D2 on just 10 % of NCT-CRC-HE-100K and testing on CRC-VAL-HE-7K resulted in significant outperformance of InceptionV3, Xception, and DenseNet201 benchmarks, achieving an accuracy rate of 82.98 % (J, MCC, Kp, and CSI of 0.7227, 0.8095, 0.8081, and 0.6671). Finally, using explainable AI algorithms such as Grad -CAM, Grad -CAM ++, Score -CAM, and Faster Score -CAM, along with their emphasized versions, we visualized the features from the last layer of DenseNet201 for histopathological as well as CT -scan image samples.
   The proposed dense models, with their multi -modality, robustness, and efficiency in cancer image classification, hold the promise of significant advancements in medical diagnostics. They have the potential to revolutionize early cancer detection and improve healthcare accessibility worldwide.

AB  - Machine learning is becoming increasingly prominent in healthcare. Although its benefits are clear, growing attention is being given to how these tools may exacerbate existing biases and disparities. In this study, we introduce an adversarial training framework that is capable of mitigating biases that may have been acquired through data collection. We demonstrate this proposed framework on the real-world task of rapidly predicting COVID-19, and focus on mitigating site-specific (hospital) and demographic (ethnicity) biases. Using the statistical definition of equalized odds, we show that adversarial training improves outcome fairness, while still achieving clinically-effective screening performances (negative predictive values >0.98). We compare our method to previous benchmarks, and perform prospective and external validation across four independent hospital cohorts. Our method can be generalized to any outcomes, models, and definitions of fairness.

AB  - The integration of deep learning in healthcare has propelled advancements in diagnostics and decision support. However, the inherent opacity of deep neural networks (DNNs) poses challenges to their acceptance and trust in clinical settings. This survey paper delves into the landscape of explainable deep learning techniques within the healthcare domain, offering a thorough examination of deep learning explainability techniques. Recognizing the pressing need for nuanced interpretability, we extend our focus to include the integration of fuzzy logic as a novel and vital category. The survey begins by categorizing and critically analyzing existing intrinsic, visualization, and distillation techniques, shedding light on their strengths and limitations in healthcare applications. Building upon this foundation, we introduce fuzzy logic as a distinct category, emphasizing its capacity to address uncertainties inherent in medical data, thus contributing to the interpretability of DNNs. Fuzzy logic, traditionally applied in decision-making contexts, offers a unique perspective on unraveling the black box of DNNs, providing a structured framework for capturing and explaining complex decision processes. Through a comprehensive exploration of techniques, we showcase the effectiveness of fuzzy logic as an additional layer of interpretability, complementing intrinsic, visualization, and distillation methods. Our survey contributes to a holistic understanding of explainable deep learning in healthcare, facilitating the seamless integration of DNNs into clinical workflows. By combining traditional methods with the novel inclusion of fuzzy logic, we aim to provide a nuanced and comprehensive view of interpretability techniques, advancing the transparency and trustworthiness of deep learning models in the healthcare landscape.

AB  - Fall detection is an emerging problem in the field of elderly care and health monitoring. Falls can cause severe injuries and even death among the elderly, and prompt detection can significantly reduce the risk of further damage. Deep learning plays a pivotal role in fall detection by enabling the recognition of complex patterns and the analysis of spatial and temporal data, leading to accurate and efficient identification of fall events. However, some recent deep learning models still face challenges and limitations, particularly in terms of interpretability and explainability. In this paper, CABMNet has been proposed, an adaptive twostage deep learning network that optimizes spatial features through convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and convolutional block attention module (CBAM) in the initial stage, followed by bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTMs) enhanced with multi -head attention (MHA) for temporal analysis in the subsequent stage. The incorporation of attention in the proposed work addresses issues including feature discrimination, temporal analysis, and model interpretability, leading to improved overall performance and efficiency of fall detection. Additionally, a Kalman filter is integrated to enhance noise reduction in the preprocessing stage. Evaluation on diverse five datasets indicates that CABMNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, achieving accuracy rates of 99.27% for KFall, 99.85% for MobiAct, 99.55% for SmartFall, 98.36% for URFall, and 98.52% for MobiFall. The proposed CABMNet demonstrates substantial applicability in healthcare, specifically in the domains of elderly care, health monitoring, and fall detection, contributing to enhanced well-being and safety for elderly people.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) could revolutionise health care, potentially improving clinician decision making and patient safety, and reducing the impact of workforce shortages. However, policymakers and regulators have concerns over whether AI and clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) are trusted by stakeholders, and indeed whether they are worthy of trust. Yet, what is meant by trust and trustworthiness is often implicit, and it may not be clear who or what is being trusted. We address these lacunae, focusing largely on the perspective(s) of clinicians on trust and trustworthiness in AI and CDSSs. Empirical studies suggest that clinicians' concerns about their use include the accuracy of advice given and potential legal liability if harm to a patient occurs. Onora O'Neill's conceptualisation of trust and trustworthiness provides the framework for our analysis, generating a productive understanding of clinicians' reported trust issues. Through unpacking these concepts, we gain greater clarity over the meaning ascribed to them by stakeholders; delimit the extent to which stakeholders are talking at cross purposes; and promote the continued utility of trust and trustworthiness as useful concepts in current debates around the use of AI and CDSSs.

AB  - Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds great potential for revolutionizing health care by providing clinicians with data-driven insights that support more accurate and efficient clinical decisions. However, applying AI in clinical settings is often challenging due to the complexity and vastness of medical information. This perspective article explores how AI development methodologies can be adapted to support clinicians in their decision-making processes, emphasizing the importance of a hybrid approach that combines AI capabilities with clinicians' expertise. Patients and Methods: We developed a conceptual framework designed to integrate AI-driven hybrid intelligence into clinical practice to enhance decision-making. This framework focuses on adapting key AI concepts, such as backpropagation, quantization, and avoiding overfitting, to help clinicians better interpret complex medical data and improve diagnosis and treatment planning. Results: Several AI methodologies were adapted to enhance clinical decision-making. First, backpropagation allows clinicians to refine initial assessments by revisiting them as new data emerges, improving diagnostic accuracy over time. Second, quantization helps break down complex medical problems into manageable components, enabling clinicians to prioritize critical elements of care. Finally, avoiding overfitting encourages clinicians to balance rare diagnoses with more common explanations, reducing the risk of diagnostic errors and unnecessary complexity. Conclusion: The integration of AI-driven hybrid intelligence has the potential to enhance clinical decision-making. By adapting AI methodologies, clinicians can enhance their ability to analyze data, prioritize treatments, and make more accurate diagnoses while preserving the essential human aspect of health care. This framework highlights the importance of combining AI's strengths with clinicians' expertise for more effective and balanced decision-making in clinical practice. This perspective highlights the value of hybrid intelligence in achieving more balanced, effective, and patient-centered decision-making in health care.

AB  - In recent years, AI and quantum technologies have received a great deal of interest from a wide range of fields. This research introduces a novel methodology for creating AI systems that are both interpretable and clever, making them ideal for use in safe, trustworthy healthcare environments. In order to handle and analyse large healthcare datasets while maintaining privacy and security, our technology employs quantum optical neural networks (QONN). We place a premium on gathering useful healthcare data while strictly protecting individual privacy. The collected data undergoes meticulous cleaning and preprocessing, including normalization procedures to eliminate noise, outliers, and irrelevant information. The core of our approach involves the construction of a neural network utilizing both optical and quantum computing techniques. Key components of QONNs comprise qubits, optical elements, and conventional neural network layers. The training of the QONN is executed using pre-evaluated healthcare data, optimizing its performance through advanced techniques such as Improved Genetic Algorithms (IGA). Furthermore, we establish an AI system that employs explicit skill-based approaches. To achieve this, interpretability algorithms, saliency maps, and attention mechanisms may be essential tools. A critical aspect of this study involves a comprehensive evaluation of the AI system's performance. This evaluation includes soliciting feedback from qualified medical experts and implementing necessary enhancements and adjustments to augment its functionality and rectify any shortcomings. To assess the effectiveness of the constructed AI system, we conduct an analysis of pertinent metrics. We compare the system's results with those obtained using various healthcare analytics methods to ascertain its efficacy. This rigorous evaluation ensures that the AI system is not only functional but also a valuable asset in the realm of healthcare analytics and decision-making.

AB  - Background . Dyslexia is a neurological disorder that affects an individual's language processing abilities. Early care and intervention can help dyslexic individuals succeed academically and socially. Recent developments in deep learning (DL) approaches motivate researchers to build dyslexia detection models (DDMs). DL approaches facilitate the integration of multi-modality data. However, there are few multimodality-based DDMs. Methods . In this study, the authors built a DL -based DDM using multi-modality data. A squeeze and excitation (SE) integrated MobileNet V3 model, self-attention mechanisms (SA) based EfficientNet B7 model, and early stopping and SA -based Bi-directional long short -term memory (Bi-LSTM) models were developed to extract features from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI, and electroencephalography (EEG) data. In addition, the authors fine-tuned the LightGBM model using the Hyperband optimization technique to detect dyslexia using the extracted features. Three datasets containing FMRI, MRI, and EEG data were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed DDM. Results . The findings supported the significance of the proposed DDM in detecting dyslexia with limited computational resources. The proposed model outperformed the existing DDMs by producing an optimal accuracy of 98.9%, 98.6%, and 98.8% for the FMRI, MRI, and EEG datasets, respectively. Healthcare centers and educational institutions can benefit from the proposed model to identify dyslexia in the initial stages. The interpretability of the proposed model can be improved by integrating vision transformers-based feature extraction.

AB  - Dementia is a condition that affects brain functions and usually occurs with age, resulting in a decrease in cognitive functions (such as thinking, remembering, and decision-making). The most common type of dementia is Alzheimer's disease. Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is essential to ensure benefit from treatment options, help plan the future, and facilitate the management of symptoms. Significant advances have been made in AI-assisted MRI analysis for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. This study proposed a separable convolution-based neural network called DEMxNET to classify four different Alzheimer's stages. The proposed model was compared with nine different state-of-the-art transfer learning models named VGG16, VGG19, InceptionV3, Xception, DenseNet201, MobileNetV2, ResNetRS101, NASNetMobile, and ConvNeXtBase. The Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was used to solve the class imbalance problem in the dataset. The proposed DEMxNET model achieved the highest performance compared to other models and reached an accuracy rate of 99.79%. In addition to artificial intelligence-supported diagnostic methods, the explainability and understandability of how the diagnosis is made are also essential for patients and healthcare professionals. In this respect, the explainability and the performance of the DEMxNET model were considered. The explainability of the model was ensured using the LIME method.

AB  - The IoT refers to the interconnection of things to the physical network that is embedded with software, sensors, and other devices to exchange information from one device to the other. The interconnection of devices means there is the possibility of challenges such as security, trustworthiness, reliability, confidentiality, and so on. To address these issues, we have proposed a novel group theory (GT)-based binary spring search (BSS) algorithm which consists of a hybrid deep neural network approach. The proposed approach effectively detects the intrusion within the IoT network. Initially, the privacy-preserving technology was implemented using a blockchain-based methodology. Security of patient health records (PHR) is the most critical aspect of cryptography over the Internet due to its value and importance, preferably in the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Search keywords access mechanism is one of the typical approaches used to access PHR from a database, but it is susceptible to various security vulnerabilities. Although blockchain-enabled healthcare systems provide security, it may lead to some loopholes in the existing state of the art. In literature, blockchain-enabled frameworks have been presented to resolve those issues. However, these methods have primarily focused on data storage and blockchain is used as a database. In this paper, blockchain as a distributed database is proposed with a homomorphic encryption technique to ensure a secure search and keywords-based access to the database. Additionally, the proposed approach provides a secure key revocation mechanism and updates various policies accordingly. As a result, a secure patient healthcare data access scheme is devised, which integrates blockchain and trust chain to fulfill the efficiency and security issues in the current schemes for sharing both types of digital healthcare data. Hence, our proposed approach provides more security, efficiency, and transparency with cost-effectiveness. We performed our simulations based on the blockchain-based tool Hyperledger Fabric and OrigionLab for analysis and evaluation. We compared our proposed results with the benchmark models, respectively. Our comparative analysis justifies that our proposed framework provides better security and searchable mechanism for the healthcare system.

AB  - Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and is characterized by high heterogeneity. Assessment of its prognosis and genetic subtyping hold significant clinical implications. However, existing DLBCL prognostic models are mainly based on transcriptomic profiles, while genetic variation detection is more commonly used in clinical practice. In addition, current clustering-based subtyping methods mostly focus on genes with high mutation frequencies, providing insufficient explanations for the heterogeneity of DLBCL. Here, we proposed VNNSurv (https://bio-web1.nscc-gz.cn/app/VNNSurv), a survival model for DLBCL patients based on a biologically informed visible neural network (VNN). VNNSurv achieved an average C-index of 0.72 on the cross-validation set (HMRN cohort, n = 928), outperforming the baseline methods. The remarkable interpretability of VNNSurv facilitated the identification of the most impactful genes and the underlying pathways through which they act on patient outcomes. When only the 30 highest- impact genes were used as genetic input, the overall performance of VNNSurv improved, and a C-index of 0.70 was achieved on the external TCGA cohort (n = 48). Leveraging these high-impact genes, including 16 genes with low (<5 %) alteration frequencies, we devised a genetic-based prognostic index (GPI) for risk stratification and a subtype identification method. We stratified the patient group according to the International Prognostic Index (IPI) into three risk grades with significant prognostic differences. Furthermore, the defined subtypes exhibited greater prognostic consistency than clustering-based methods. Broadly, VNNSurv is a valuable DLBCL survival model. Its high interpretability has significant value for precision medicine, and its framework is scalable to other diseases.

AB  - Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are essential in advancing medical diagnosis and treatment by providing non-invasive tools to assess neurological states. Among these, motor imagery (MI), in which patients mentally simulate motor tasks without physical movement, has proven to be an effective paradigm for diagnosing and monitoring neurological conditions. Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely used for MI data collection due to its high temporal resolution, cost-effectiveness, and portability. However, EEG signals can be noisy from a number of sources, including physiological artifacts and electromagnetic interference. They can also vary from person to person, which makes it harder to extract features and understand the signals. Additionally, this variability, influenced by genetic and cognitive factors, presents challenges for developing subject-independent solutions. To address these limitations, this paper presents a Multimodal and Explainable Deep Learning (MEDL) approach for MI-EEG classification and physiological interpretability. Our approach involves the following: (i) evaluating different deep learning (DL) models for subject-dependent MI-EEG discrimination; (ii) employing class activation mapping (CAM) to visualize relevant MI-EEG features; and (iii) utilizing a questionnaire-MI performance canonical correlation analysis (QMIP-CCA) to provide multidomain interpretability. On the GIGAScience MI dataset, experiments show that shallow neural networks are good at classifying MI-EEG data, while the CAM-based method finds spatio-frequency patterns. Moreover, the QMIP-CCA framework successfully correlates physiological data with MI-EEG performance, offering an enhanced, interpretable solution for BCIs.

AB  - Spear Phishing Attacks (SPAs) pose a significant threat to the healthcare sector, resulting in data breaches, financial losses, and compromised patient confidentiality. Traditional defenses, such as firewalls and antivirus software, often fail to counter these sophisticated attacks, which target human vulnerabilities. To strengthen defenses, healthcare organizations are increasingly adopting Machine Learning (ML) techniques. ML-based SPA defenses use advanced algorithms to analyze various features, including email content, sender behavior, and attachments, to detect potential threats. This capability enables proactive security measures that address risks in real-time. The interpretability of ML models fosters trust and allows security teams to continuously refine these algorithms as new attack methods emerge. Implementing ML techniques requires integrating diverse data sources, such as electronic health records, email logs, and incident reports, which enhance the algorithms' learning environment. Feedback from end-users further improves model performance. Among tested models, the hierarchical models, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) achieved the highest accuracy at 99.99%, followed closely by the sequential Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) model at 99.94%. In contrast, the traditional Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model showed an accuracy of 98.46%. This difference underscores the superior performance of advanced sequential and hierarchical models in detecting SPAs compared to traditional approaches.

AB  - Despite major advances in artificial intelligence (AI) research for healthcare, the deployment and adoption of AI technologies remain limited in clinical practice. This paper describes the FUTURE-AI framework, which provides guidance for the development and deployment of trustworthy AI tools in healthcare. The FUTURE-AI Consortium was founded in 2021 and comprises 117 interdisciplinary experts from 50 countries representing all continents, including AI scientists, clinical researchers, biomedical ethicists, and social scientists. Over a two year period, the FUTURE-AI guideline was established through consensus based on six guiding principles-fairness, universality, traceability, usability, robustness, and explainability. To operationalise trustworthy AI in healthcare, a set of 30 best practices were defined, addressing technical, clinical, socioethical, and legal dimensions. The recommendations cover the entire lifecycle of healthcare AI, from design, development, and validation to regulation, deployment, and monitoring.

AB  - Neurological disorders, including cerebral vascular occlusions and strokes, present a major global health challenge due to their high mortality rates and long-term disabilities. Early diagnosis, particularly within the first hours, is crucial for preventing irreversible damage and improving patient outcomes. Although neuroimaging techniques like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have advanced significantly, traditional methods often fail to fully capture the complexity of brain lesions. Deep learning has recently emerged as a powerful tool in medical imaging, offering high accuracy in detecting and segmenting brain anomalies. This review examines 61 MRIbased studies published between 2020 and 2024, focusing on the role of deep learning in diagnosing cerebral vascular occlusion-related conditions. It evaluates the successes and limitations of these studies, including the adequacy and diversity of datasets, and addresses challenges such as data privacy and algorithm explainability. Comparisons between convolutional neural network (CNN)-based and Vision Transformer (ViT)-based approaches reveal distinct advantages and limitations. The findings emphasize the importance of ethically secure frameworks, the inclusion of diverse datasets, and improved model interpretability. Advanced architectures like U-Net variants and transformer-based models are highlighted as promising tools to enhance reliability in clinical applications. By automating complex neuroimaging tasks and improving diagnostic accuracy, deep learning facilitates personalized treatment strategies. This review provides a roadmap for integrating technical advancements into clinical practice, underscoring the transformative potential of deep learning in managing neurological disorders and improving healthcare outcomes globally.

AB  - The decision to accept a deceased donor organ offer for transplant, or wait for something potentially better in the future, can be challenging. Clinical decision support tools predicting transplant outcomes are lacking. This project uses interpretable methods to predict both graft failure and patient death using data from previously accepted kidney transplant offers. Using more than 25 years of transplant outcome data, we train and compare several survival analysis models in single risk settings. In addition, we use post hoc interpretability techniques to clinically validate these models. Neural networks show comparable performance to the Cox proportional hazard model, with concordance of 0.63 and 0.79 for prediction of graft failure and patient death, respectively. Donor and recipient ages, the number of mismatches at DR locus, dialysis type, and primary renal disease appear to be important features for transplant outcome prediction. Owing to their good predictive performance and the clinical relevance of their post hoc interpretation, neural networks represent a promising core component in the construction of future decision support systems for transplant offering.

AB  - Deep learning has demonstrated remarkable performance in the medical domain, with accuracy that rivals or even exceeds that of human experts. However, it has a significant problem that these models are "black-box" structures, which means they are opaque, non-intuitive, and difficult for people to understand. This creates a barrier to the application of deep learning models in clinical practice due to lack of interpretability, trust, and transparency. To overcome this problem, several studies on interpretability have been proposed. Therefore, in this paper, we comprehensively review the interpretability of deep learning in medical diagnosis based on the current literature, including some common interpretability methods used in the medical domain, various applications with interpretability for disease diagnosis, prevalent evaluation metrics, and several disease datasets. In addition, the challenges of interpretability and future research directions are also discussed here. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that various applications of interpretability methods for disease diagnosis have been summarized.

AB  - This paper presents a human activity recognition framework tailored for healthcare applications, emphasizing the essential balance between accuracy and interpretability required for medical monitoring. The model utilizes MediaPipe to capture the complex dynamics of human movements and introduce an interpretable feature reduction function. This method improves traditional dimensionality reduction techniques like principal component analysis. Our feature engineering is based on the importance of feature permutations; it selectively retains salient features, thus enhancing the interpretability essential for the medical domain. We validated our method on the "NTU RGB+D" dataset; it improves the recognition accuracy for a range of human activities that may be relevant for elderly care. However, the recognition of subtler activities like neck pain and headaches requires further investigation. This study underscores the potential to advance patient monitoring and sets the stage for its expanded application in various medical contexts.

AB  - BackgroundHeart failure (HF) impacts nearly 6 million individuals in the U.S., with a projected 46% increase by 2030, is creating significant healthcare burdens. Predictive models, particularly machine learning (ML)-based models, offer promising solutions to identify patients at greater risk of adverse outcomes, such as mortality and hospital readmission. This review aims to assess the effectiveness of ML models in predicting HF-related outcomes, with a focus on their potential to improve patient care and clinical decision-making. We aim to assess how effectively machine learning models predict mortality and readmission in heart failure patients to improve clinical outcomes.MethodThe study followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines and was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42023481167). We conducted a systematic search in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases using specific keywords related to heart failure, machine learning, mortality and readmission. Extracted data focused on study characteristics, machine learning details, and outcomes, with AUC or c-index used as the primary outcomes for pooling analysis. The PROBAST tool was used to assess bias risk, evaluating models based on participants, predictors, outcomes, and statistical analysis. The meta-analysis pooled AUCs for different machine learning models predicting mortality and readmission. Prediction accuracy data was categorized by timeframes, with high heterogeneity determined by an I-2 value above 50%, leading to a random-effects model when applicable. Publication bias was assessed using Egger's and Begg's tests, with a p-value below 0.05 considered significantResultA total of 4,505 studies were identified, and after screening, 64 were included in the final analysis, covering 943,941 patients. Of these, 40 studies focused on mortality, 17 on readmission, and 7 on both outcomes. In total, 346 machine learning models were evaluated, with the most common algorithms being random forest, logistic regression, and gradient boosting. The neural network model achieved the highest overall AUC for mortality prediction (0.808), while the support vector machine performed best for readmission prediction (AUC 0.733). The analysis revealed a significant risk of bias, primarily due to reliance on retrospective data and inadequate sample size justification.ConclusionIn conclusion, this review emphasizes the strong potential of ML models in predicting HF readmission and mortality. ML algorithms show promise in improving prognostic accuracy and enabling personalized patient care. However, challenges like model interpretability, generalizability, and clinical integration persist. Overcoming these requires refined ML techniques and a robust regulatory framework to enhance HF outcomes.

AB  - Accurate and interpretable differential diagnostic technologies are crucial for supporting clinicians in decision-making and treatment-planning for patients with fever of unknown origin (FUO). Existing solutions commonly address the diagnosis of FUO by transforming it into a multi-classification task. However, after the emergence of COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians have recognized the heightened significance of early diagnosis in patients with FUO, particularly for practical needs such as early triage. This has resulted in increased demands for identifying a wider range of etiologies, shorter observation windows, and better model interpretability. In this article, we propose an interpretable hierarchical multimodal neural network framework (iHMNNF) to facilitate early diagnosis of FUO by incorporating medical domain knowledge and leveraging multimodal clinical data. The iHMNNF comprises a top-down hierarchical reasoning framework (Td-HRF) built on the class hierarchy of FUO etiologies, five local attention-based multimodal neural networks (La-MNNs) trained for each parent node of the class hierarchy, and an interpretable module based on layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) and attention mechanism. Experimental datasets were collected from electronic health records (EHRs) at a large-scale tertiary grade-A hospital in China, comprising 34,051 hospital admissions of 30,794 FUO patients from January 2011 to October 2020. Our proposed La-MNNs achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) values ranging from 0.7809 to 0.9035 across all five decomposed tasks, surpassing competing machine learning (ML) and single-modality deep learning (DL) methods while also providing enhanced interpretability. Furthermore, we explored the feasibility of identifying FUO etiologies using only the first N-hour time series data obtained after admission.

AB  - Recent research has shown that a person's heart rate (HR) can be estimated using video data through remote photoplethysmography (rPPG). However, this approach is faced with various challenges, including the inability to prepare training data that encompasses all realistic conditions, the impact of complex inference models on reasoning speed, and the lack of interpretability that hinders medical and healthcare applications. To tackle these issues, a lightweight and interpretable convolutional neural network is proposed for real-time HR monitoring using a low-cost video camera under realistic conditions. The Mediapipe framework is leveraged to construct a facial detection and tracking pipeline that is robust to head movements and illumination changes. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is then combined with a channel-wise attention-based convolutional neural network (CNN) for HR inference. Additionally, a temporal long-term peak merge method is proposed as a post-processing step to further enhance the accuracy of the neural network inference. The results of linear regression and Bland Altman analysis demonstrate consistency between the estimated HR values and the ground truth. Moreover, experimental outcomes show no significant difference in the inference times of the proposed method running with or without a GPU, with a reasoning speed on mobile CPU remaining within 100 ms, ensuring real-time HR monitoring. Furthermore, this study provides pioneering empirical evidence to open the black box of neural networks in HR monitoring using rPPG signals.

AB  - Introduction Glioblastoma (GBM), the most aggressive primary brain tumor, poses a significant challenge in predicting patient survival due to its heterogeneity and resistance to treatment. Accurate survival prediction is essential for optimizing treatment strategies and improving clinical outcomes.Methods This study utilized metadata from 135 GBM patients, including demographic, clinical, and molecular variables such as age, Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), MGMT promoter methylation, and EGFR amplification. Six machine learning models-XGBoost, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, Artificial Neural Networks, Extra Trees Regressor, and K- Nearest Neighbors-were employed to classify patients into predefined survival categories. Data preprocessing included label encoding for categorical variables and MinMax scaling for numerical features. Model performance was assessed using ROC-AUC and accuracy metrics, with hyperparameters optimized through grid search.Results XGBoost demonstrated the highest predictive accuracy, achieving a mean ROC-AUC of 0.90 and an accuracy of 0.78. Ensemble models outperformed simpler classifiers, emphasizing the predictive value of metadata. The models identified key prognostic markers, including MGMT promoter methylation and KPS, as significant contributors to survival prediction.Conclusions The application of machine learning to GBM metadata offers a robust approach to predicting patient survival. The study highlights the potential of ML models to enhance clinical decision-making and contribute to personalized treatment strategies, with a focus on accuracy, reliability, and interpretability.

AB  - The most effective and feasible method for treating cancer is early diagnosis of breast cancer. An appropriate software tool, known as computer-aided diagnosis, helps doctors identify or diagnose cancer in the early stages and more quickly, hence decreasing the mortality rate. Convolution neural networks (CNNs) have lately been utilized in medical image analysis, which can discover cancer cells or classify histopathology images by processing a large amounts of training data. In this study, we carried out transfer learning (TL) accompanied with a new self-learning algorithm for classification of breast cancer by processing the histopathological images. In this study, several pre-trained deep neural networks including, Inception V3 Net, VGG19, Alex net, ResNet-18, Google net, Shefflenet, Mobile net, Resnet 101, Inception ResnetV2 Net, and Squeeze net were examined. Using a self-learning technique for classification of sub-images instead of the whole image can increase the accuracy of cancer classification. In this technique, the main issue is that the true label of sub-images is unknown, and the classifier should be trained using noisy labels. Therefore, a hierarchal self-learning method is utilized to correct the false labels gradually. The main rule for correcting the false labels is designed based on some prior knowledge about the errors exist in the initial labels of sub-images. The proposed self-learning method reached the accuracy of 99.1%, after 4 level of label correction process accompanied with Inception-V3Net pretrained network. Overall, the use of self-learning DNNs for the classification of histopathological breast cancer images can improve the accuracy, efficiency, interpretability of the classification results and contribute to the development of personalized and precision medicine.

AB  - Breast cancer image classification remains a challenging task due to the high-resolution nature of pathological images and their complex feature distributions. Graph neural networks (GNNs) offer promising capabilities to capture local structural information but often suffer from limited generalization and reliance on shortcut features. This study proposes a novel causal discovery attention-based graph neural network (CDA-GNN) model. The model converts high-resolution image data into graph data using superpixel segmentation and employs a causal attention mechanism to identify and utilize key causal features. A backdoor adjustment strategy further disentangles causal features from shortcut features, enhancing model interpretability and robustness. Experimental evaluations on the 2018 BACH breast cancer image dataset demonstrate that CDA-GNN achieves a classification accuracy of 86.36%. Additional metrics, including F1-score and ROC, validate the superior performance and generalization of the proposed approach. The CDA-GNN model, with its powerful automated cancer image analysis capabilities and strong interpretability, provides an effective tool for clinical applications. It significantly reduces the workload of healthcare professionals while facilitating the early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer, thereby improving diagnostic efficiency and accuracy.

AB  - Hemoglobin is a vital protein in red blood cells responsible for transporting oxygen throughout the body. Its accurate measurement is crucial for diagnosing and managing conditions such as anemia and diabetes, where abnormal hemoglobin levels can indicate significant health issues. Traditional methods for hemoglobin measurement are invasive, causing pain, risk of infection, and are less convenient for frequent monitoring. PPG is a transformative technology in wearable healthcare for noninvasive monitoring and widely explored for blood pressure, sleep, blood glucose, and stress analysis. In this work, we propose a hemoglobin estimation method using an adaptive lightweight convolutional neural network (HMALCNN) from PPG. The HMALCNN is designed to capture both fine-grained local waveform characteristics and global contextual patterns, ensuring robust performance across acquisition settings. We validated our approach on two multi-regional datasets containing 152 and 68 subjects, respectively, employing a subjectindependent 5-fold cross-validation strategy. The proposed method achieved root mean square errors (RMSE) of 0.90 and 1.20 g/dL for the two datasets, with strong Pearson correlations of 0.82 and 0.72. We conducted extensive posthoc analyses to assess clinical utility and interpretability. A +/- 1 g/dL clinical error tolerance evaluation revealed that 91.3% and 86.7% of predictions for the two datasets fell within the acceptable clinical range. Hemoglobin range-wise analysis demonstrated consistently high accuracy in the normal and low hemoglobin categories. Statistical significance testing using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test confirmed the stability of performance across validation folds (p > 0.05 for both RMSE and correlation). Furthermore, model interpretability was enhanced using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), supporting the model's clinical trustworthiness. The proposed HMALCNN offers a computationally efficient, clinically interpretable, and generalizable framework for noninvasive hemoglobin monitoring, with strong potential for integration into wearable healthcare systems as a practical alternative to invasive measurement techniques.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain one of the foremost causes of death globally; hence, the need for several must-have, advanced automated diagnostic solutions towards early detection and intervention. Traditional auscultation of cardiovascular sounds is heavily reliant on clinical expertise and subject to high variability. To counter this limitation, this study proposes an AI-driven classification system for cardiovascular sounds whereby deep learning techniques are engaged to automate the detection of an abnormal heartbeat. We employ FastAI vision-learner-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that include ResNet, DenseNet, VGG, ConvNeXt, SqueezeNet, and AlexNet to classify heart sound recordings. Instead of raw waveform analysis, the proposed approach transforms preprocessed cardiovascular audio signals into spectrograms, which are suited for capturing temporal and frequency-wise patterns. The models are trained on the PASCAL Cardiovascular Challenge dataset while taking into consideration the recording variations, noise levels, and acoustic distortions. To demonstrate generalization, external validation using Google's Audio set Heartbeat Sound dataset was performed using a dataset rich in cardiovascular sounds. Comparative analysis revealed that DenseNet-201, ConvNext Large, and ResNet-152 could deliver superior performance to the other architec-tures, achieving an accuracy of 81.50%, a precision of 85.50%, and an F1-score of 84.50%. In the process, we performed statistical significance testing, such as the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, to validate performance improvements over traditional classification methods. Beyond the technical contributions, the research underscores clinical integration, outlining a pathway in which the proposed system can augment conventional electronic stethoscopes and telemedicine platforms in the AI-assisted diagnostic workflows. We also discuss in detail issues of computational efficiency, model interpretability, and ethical considerations, particularly concerning algorithmic bias stemming from imbalanced datasets and the need for real-time processing in clinical settings. The study describes a scalable, automated system combining deep learning, feature extraction using spectrograms, and external validation that can assist healthcare providers in the early and accurate detection of cardiovascular disease. AI-driven solutions can be viable in improving access, reducing delays in diagnosis, and ultimately even the continued global burden of heart disease.

AB  - Background: Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders present significant healthcare challenges, requiring rapid, accurate, and effective diagnostic methods to improve treatment outcomes and prevent complications. Wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) is an effective tool for diagnosing GI abnormalities; however, precisely identifying diverse lesions with similar visual patterns remains difficult. Methods: Many existing computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) systems rely on manually crafted features or single deep learning (DL) models, which often fail to capture the complex and varied characteristics of GI diseases. In this study, we proposed "EndoNet," a multi-stage hybrid DL framework for eight-class GI disease classification using WCE images. Features were extracted from two different layers of three pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) (Inception, Xception, ResNet101), with both inter-layer and inter-model feature fusion performed. Dimensionality reduction was achieved using Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NNMF), followed by selection of the most informative features via the Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) method. Results: Two datasets were used to evaluate the performance of EndoNer, including Kvasir v2 and HyperKvasir. Classification using seven different Machine Learning algorithms achieved a maximum accuracy of 97.8% and 98.4% for Kvasir v2 and HyperKvasir datasets, respectively. Conclusions: By integrating transfer learning with feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, and feature selection, EndoNet provides high accuracy, flexibility, and interpretability. This framework offers a powerful and generalizable artificial intelligence solution suitable for clinical decision support systems.

AB  - Background: Melasma is a prevalent pigmentary disorder characterized by treatment resistance and high recurrence. Existing assessment methods like the Melasma Area and Severity Index (MASI) are subjective and prone to inter-observer variability. Objective: This study aimed to develop an AI-assisted, real-time melasma severity classification framework based on deep learning and clinical facial images. Methods: A total of 1368 anonymized facial images were collected from clinically diagnosed melasma patients. After image preprocessing and MASI-based labeling, six CNN architectures were trained and evaluated using PyTorch. Model performance was assessed through accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC, and interpretability via Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP). Results: GoogLeNet achieved the best performance, with an accuracy of 0.755 and an F1-score of 0.756. AUC values across severity levels reached 0.93 (mild), 0.86 (moderate), and 0.94 (severe). LRP analysis confirmed GoogLeNet's superior feature attribution. Conclusion: This study presents a robust, interpretable deep learning model for melasma severity classification, offering enhanced diagnostic consistency. Future work will integrate multimodal data for more comprehensive assessment.

AB  - Background Neuromuscular diseases (NMDs) pose significant diagnostic challenges due to their heterogeneous clinical manifestations and the limitations of traditional diagnostic tools. While musculoskeletal ultrasound has become a promising non-invasive modality for evaluating muscle pathology, its diagnostic accuracy remains heavily dependent on the operator's expertise. To address this, we propose a lightweight and interpretable deep learning model to enable automated classification of ultrasound images in NMD screening.Method We developed a novel model, termed NMD-AssistNet, which integrates GhostNet as the backbone with CBAM attention modules and depthwise separable convolutions to enhance both efficiency and discriminative capacity. The model was trained and evaluated on a public dataset containing 3,917 annotated ultrasound images of various muscle groups. Mixup augmentation, label smoothing, and SWALR learning rate scheduling were applied to improve generalizability. Performance was benchmarked against CSPNet, EfficientNet, GhostNet, HRNet, and Vision Transformer.Results NMD-AssistNet achieved the highest performance among the evaluated models, reaching a classification accuracy of 0.9502 and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9776. Grad-CAM visualizations revealed that the model effectively focused on clinically relevant muscle regions, highlighting its potential interpretability.Conclusion NMD-AssistNet demonstrates strong diagnostic capability, computational efficiency, and model interpretability and offers a promising solution for real-time, automated NMD screening. This framework has the potential to be deployed in portable ultrasound systems or edge AI devices to assist clinicians in both hospital and community healthcare settings.

AB  - Featured Application A better discrimination in a prediction model does not imply a better interpretability. In healthcare, where transparency is crucial, both discriminability and interpretability should be checked before stating that a new model is better.Abstract Background: In predictive modelling, particularly in fields such as healthcare, the importance of understanding the model's behaviour rivals, if not surpasses, that of discriminability. To this end, attention mechanisms have been included in deep learning models for years. However, when comparing different models, the one with the best discriminability is usually chosen without considering the clinical plausibility of their predictions. Objective: In this work several attention-based deep learning architectures with increasing degrees of complexity were designed and compared aiming to study the balance between discriminability and plausibility with architecture complexity when working with longitudinal data from Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Methods: We developed four deep learning-based architectures with attention mechanisms that were progressively more complex to handle longitudinal data from EHRs. We evaluated their discriminability and resulting attention maps and compared them amongst architectures and different input processing approaches. We trained them on 10 years of data from EHRs from Catalonia (Spain) and evaluated them using a 5-fold cross-validation to predict 1-year all-cause mortality in a subsample of 500,000 people over 65 years of age. Results: Generally, the simplest architectures led to the best overall discriminability, slightly decreasing with complexity by up to 8.7%. However, the attention maps resulting from the simpler architectures were less informative and less clinically plausible compared to those from more complex architectures. Moreover, the latter could give attention weights both in the time and feature domains. Conclusions: Our results suggest that discriminability and more informative and clinically plausible attention maps do not always go together. Given the preferences within the healthcare field for enhanced explainability, establishing a balance with discriminability is imperative.

AB  - Background Access to health care is a key social determinant of health, yet individual experiences of need and barriers-especially in rural and racially diverse regions-are often overlooked. Traditional models may miss complex sociodemographic and household patterns. This study applies machine learning (ML) to examine healthcare needs and access barriers among adults in New Mexico, a diverse state with high service needs.Objectives (1) Identify predictors of self-reported healthcare needs across medical, dental, and mental health domains; (2) determine factors and reasons linked to access barriers; (3) compare performance across seven ML algorithms; and (4) generate interpretable insights to inform interventions.Methods We analyzed survey data from 9,099 adults across 13 New Mexico counties (2019-2024). Predictors included sociodemographic, geographic, and household factors. Models-spanning linear, tree-based, kernel-based, and neural networks-were evaluated using recall, F1-score, and area under the precision-recall curve. Interpretability tools included SHAP, partial dependence plots, and permutation importance.Results (1) Predictors varied by domain. Mental health needs were linked to younger age, low income, limited family support, and being female. Dental needs were highest among higher-income White parents; medical needs were tied to larger households and parenting status. Family support consistently reduced barriers. (2) Common barriers included cost, wait times, and provider shortages. Hispanic respondents reported fewer mental health barriers. (3) Neural networks and tree-based models performed best (recall up to 0.99). (4) Interpretability methods revealed complex, nonlinear predictor patterns.Conclusion ML models revealed complex, domain-specific patterns of need and access, highlighting the limitations of one-size-fits-all approaches. Community-based initiatives like 100% Community can leverage these insights to target structurally excluded populations and strengthen local support systems. Hyperlocal planning, state-level policy reform, and family-centered interventions are essential to addressing healthcare disparities in high-need settings.

KW  - STRIPES
AB  - Machine learning (ML) models are powerful tools for detecting complex patterns, yet their 'black-box' nature limits their interpretability, hindering their use in critical domains like healthcare and finance. Interpretable ML methods aim to explain how features influence model predictions but often focus on univariate feature importance, overlooking complex feature interactions. Although recent efforts extend interpretability to feature interactions, existing approaches struggle with robustness and error control, especially under data perturbations. In this study, we introduce Diamond, a method for trustworthy feature interaction discovery. Diamond uniquely integrates the model-X knockoffs framework to control the false discovery rate, ensuring a low proportion of falsely detected interactions. Diamond includes a non-additivity distillation procedure that refines existing interaction importance measures to isolate non-additive interaction effects and preserve false discovery rate control. This approach addresses the limitations of off-the-shelf interaction measures, which, when used naively, can lead to inaccurate discoveries. Diamond's applicability spans a broad class of ML models, including deep neural networks, transformers, tree-based models and factorization-based models. Empirical evaluations on both simulated and real datasets across various biomedical studies demonstrate its utility in enabling reliable data-driven scientific discoveries. Diamond represents a significant step forward in leveraging ML for scientific innovation and hypothesis generation.

AB  - Classification and prediction tasks are common in health research. With the increasing availability of vast health data repositories (e.g. electronic medical record databases) and advances in computing power, traditional statistical approaches are being augmented or replaced with machine learning (ML) approaches to classify and predict health outcomes. ML describes the automated process of identifying ("learning") patterns in data to perform tasks. Developing an ML model includes selecting between many ML models (e.g. decision trees, support vector machines, neural networks); model specifications such as hyperparameter tuning; and evaluation of model performance. This process is conducted repeatedly to find the model and corresponding specifications that optimize some measure of model performance. ML models can make more accurate classifications and predictions than their statistical counterparts and confer greater flexibility when modelling unstructured data or interactions between covariates; however, many ML models require larger sample sizes to achieve good classification or predictive performance and have been criticized as "black box" for their poor transparency and interpretability. ML holds potential in family medicine for risk profiling of patients' disease risk and clinical decision support to present additional information at times of uncertainty or high demand. In the future, ML approaches are positioned to become commonplace in family medicine. As such, it is important to understand the objectives that can be addressed using ML approaches and the associated techniques and limitations. This article provides a brief introduction into the use of ML approaches for classification and prediction tasks in family medicine.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the landscape of laboratory medicine by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and enabling more personalized care. Given its growing use in clinical settings, evaluating the performance of AI models in diagnostic tasks is essential to inform evidence-based implementation strategies. This meta-analysis systematically assessed the diagnostic effectiveness of AI-based models. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore using predefined keywords related to AI and diagnostic accuracy. From 430 retrieved studies, 17 met the inclusion criteria. Data extracted included study design, AI model type, input modality, and performance metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC). Random-effects meta-analysis and subgroup analyses were performed to investigate heterogeneity and model-specific trends. The pooled analysis yielded a high combined AUC of 0.9025, indicating strong diagnostic capability of AI models. However, substantial heterogeneity was detected (I2 = 91.01%), attributed to differences in model architecture, diagnostic domains, and data quality. Subgroup analyses showed that convolutional neural networks and random forest models achieved higher AUC values, while domains like endocrinology demonstrated greater performance variability. Funnel plot inspection and sensitivity analysis indicated the presence of publication bias. AI shows strong potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy in personalized laboratory medicine. Nonetheless, methodological heterogeneity and publication bias remain significant challenges. Future research should prioritize standardized evaluation frameworks, transparency, and the development of explainable AI systems to ensure responsible clinical integration.

AB  - Cadario et al. identify potential reasons underlying the resistance to use medical artificial intelligence and test interventions to overcome this resistance.
   Medical artificial intelligence is cost-effective and scalable and often outperforms human providers, yet people are reluctant to use it. We show that resistance to the utilization of medical artificial intelligence is driven by both the subjective difficulty of understanding algorithms (the perception that they are a 'black box') and by an illusory subjective understanding of human medical decision-making. In five pre-registered experiments (1-3B: N = 2,699), we find that people exhibit an illusory understanding of human medical decision-making (study 1). This leads people to believe they better understand decisions made by human than algorithmic healthcare providers (studies 2A,B), which makes them more reluctant to utilize algorithmic than human providers (studies 3A,B). Fortunately, brief interventions that increase subjective understanding of algorithmic decision processes increase willingness to utilize algorithmic healthcare providers (studies 3A,B). A sixth study on Google Ads for an algorithmic skin cancer detection app finds that the effectiveness of such interventions generalizes to field settings (study 4: N = 14,013).

AB  - Background: Gastrointestinal (GI) diseases pose significant challenges for healthcare systems, largely due to the complexities involved in their detection and treatment. Despite the advancements in deep neural networks, their high computational demands hinder their practical use in clinical environments. Objective: This study aims to address the computational inefficiencies of deep neural networks by proposing a lightweight model that integrates model compression techniques, ConvLSTM layers, and ConvNext Blocks, all optimized through Knowledge Distillation (KD). Methods: A dataset of 6000 endoscopic images of various GI diseases was utilized. Advanced image preprocessing techniques, including adaptive noise reduction and image detail enhancement, were employed to improve accuracy and interpretability. The model's performance was assessed in terms of accuracy, computational cost, and disk space usage. Results: The proposed lightweight model achieved an exceptional overall accuracy of 99.38 %. It operates efficiently with a computational cost of 0.61 GFLOPs and occupies only 3.09 MB of disk space. Additionally, GradCAM visualizations demonstrated enhanced model saliency and interpretability, offering insights into the decision-making process of the model post-KD.

AB  - Breast cancer detection remains one of the most challenging problems in medical imaging. We propose a novel hybrid model that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks, and EfficientNet-B0, a pre-trained model. By leveraging EfficientNet-B0, which has been trained on the large and diverse ImageNet dataset, our approach benefits from transfer learning, enabling more efficient feature extraction from mammographic images compared to traditional methods that require CNNs to be trained from scratch. The model further enhances performance by incorporating Bi-LSTM, which allows for processing temporal dependencies in the data, which is crucial for accurately detecting complex patterns in breast cancer images. We fine-tuned the model using the Adam optimizer to optimize performance, significantly improving accuracy and processing speed. Extensive evaluation of well-established datasets such as CBIS-DDSM and MIAS resulted in an outstanding 99.2% accuracy in distinguishing between benign and malignant tumors. We also compared our hybrid model to other well-known architectures, including VGG-16, ResNet-50, and DenseNet169, using three optimizers: Adam, RMSProp, and SGD. The Adam optimizer consistently achieved the highest accuracy and lowest loss across the training and validation phases. Additionally, feature visualization techniques were applied to enhance the model's interpretability, providing deeper insight into the decision-making process. The Proposed hybrid model sets a new standard in breast cancer detection, offering exceptional accuracy and improved transparency, making it a valuable tool for clinicians in the fight against breast cancer.

LA  - English
KW  - CLASSIFICATION
AB  - Gastric cancer possesses great histological and molecular diversity, which creates obstacles for rapid and efficient diagnoses. Classic diagnoses either depend on the pathologist's judgment, which relies heavily on subjective experience, or time-consuming molecular assays for subtype diagnosis. Here, we present a deep learning (DL) system to achieve interpretable tumor differentiation grade and microsatellite instability (MSI) recognition in gastric cancer directly using hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining whole-slide images (WSIs). WSIs from 467 patients were divided into three cohorts: the training cohort with 348 annotated WSIs, the testing cohort with 88 annotated WSIs, and the integration testing cohort with 31 original WSIs without tumor contour annotation. First, the DL models comprehensibly achieved tumor differentiation recognition with an F1 values of 0.8615 and 0.8977 for poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (PDA) and well-differentiated adenocarcinoma (WDA) classes. Its ability to extract pathological features about the glandular structure formation, which is the key to distinguishing between PDA and WDA, increased the interpretability of the DL models. Second, the DL models achieved MSI status recognition with a patient-level accuracy of 86.36% directly from HE-stained WSIs in the testing cohort. Finally, the integrated end-to-end system achieved patient-level MSI recognition from original HE staining WSIs with an accuracy of 83.87% in the integration testing cohort with no tumor contour annotation. The proposed system, therefore, demonstrated high accuracy and interpretability, which can potentially promote the implementation of artificial intelligence healthcare.
   Gastric cancer possesses great histological and molecular diversity, which creates obstacles for rapid and efficient diagnoses. To overcome the limitations of the classic diagnostic procedure in gastric cancer, the authors established a deep learning system to achieve intelligent tumor differentiation grading and microsatellite instability status recognition using hematoxylin-eosin stained whole slide images from 467 patients. They used the convolutional neural network visualization to demonstrate the key pathological features learned by the system to increase system interpretability.

AB  - The main purpose of cervical cancer diagnosis is a correct and rapid detection of the disease and the determination of its histological type. This study investigates the effectiveness of combining handcrafted feature-based methods with convolutional neural networks for the determination of cancer histological type, emphasizing the role of feature selection in enhancing classification accuracy. Here, a data set of liquid-based cytology images was analyzed and a set of handcrafted morphological features was introduced. Furthermore, features were optimized through advanced selection techniques, including stepwise and significant feature selection, to reduce feature dimensionality while retaining critical diagnostic information. These reduced feature sets were evaluated using several classifiers including support vector machines and compared with CNN-based approach, highlighting differences in accuracy and precision. The results demonstrate that optimized feature sets, paired with SVM classifiers, achieve classification performance comparable to those of CNNs while significantly reducing computational complexity. This finding underscores the potential of feature reduction techniques in creating efficient diagnostic frameworks. The study concludes that while convolutional neural networks offer robust classification capabilities, optimized handcrafted features remain a viable and cost-effective alternative, particularly when the data count is limited. This work contributes to advancing automated diagnostic systems by balancing accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability.

AB  - Background Machine learning is a broad term encompassing a number of methods that allow the investigator to learn from the data. These methods may permit large real-world databases to be more rapidly translated to applications to inform patient-provider decision making. Methods This systematic literature review was conducted to identify published observational research of employed machine learning to inform decision making at the patient-provider level. The search strategy was implemented and studies meeting eligibility criteria were evaluated by two independent reviewers. Relevant data related to study design, statistical methods and strengths and limitations were identified; study quality was assessed using a modified version of the Luo checklist. Results A total of 34 publications from January 2014 to September 2020 were identified and evaluated for this review. There were diverse methods, statistical packages and approaches used across identified studies. The most common methods included decision tree and random forest approaches. Most studies applied internal validation but only two conducted external validation. Most studies utilized one algorithm, and only eight studies applied multiple machine learning algorithms to the data. Seven items on the Luo checklist failed to be met by more than 50% of published studies. Conclusions A wide variety of approaches, algorithms, statistical software, and validation strategies were employed in the application of machine learning methods to inform patient-provider decision making. There is a need to ensure that multiple machine learning approaches are used, the model selection strategy is clearly defined, and both internal and external validation are necessary to be sure that decisions for patient care are being made with the highest quality evidence. Future work should routinely employ ensemble methods incorporating multiple machine learning algorithms.

AB  - Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a degenerative and progressive neurological condition. Early diagnosis can improve treatment for patients and is performed through dopaminergic imaging techniques like the SPECT DaTSCAN. In this study, we propose a machine learning model that accurately classifies any given DaTSCAN as having Parkinson's disease or not, in addition to providing a plausible reason for the prediction. This kind of reasoning is done through the use of visual indicators generated using Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explainer (LIME) methods. DaTSCANs were drawn from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative database and trained on a CNN (VGG16) using transfer learning, yielding an accuracy of 95.2%, a sensitivity of 97.5%, and a specificity of 90.9%. Keeping model interpretability of paramount importance, especially in the healthcare field, this study utilises LIME explanations to distinguish PD from non-PD, using visual superpixels on the DaTSCANs. It could be concluded that the proposed system, in union with its measured interpretability and accuracy may effectively aid medical workers in the early diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease.

AB  - Digital e-governance has grown tremendously due to the massive information technology revolution. Banking, Healthcare, and Insurance are some sectors that rely on ownership identification during various stages of service provision. Watermarking has been employed as a primary factor in authenticating stakeholders in such circumstances. In this work, a three-layer feature-dependent image watermarking approach in the transform domain has been proposed. In this Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) influenced approach, the first decomposition level holds the Singular Values of a specific encrypted logo. In the second level of decomposition, the specific textual authentication signature is included in an arithmetic coding tag. The third level of decomposition has been utilised to keep the concerned identity of the owner in a compressed form using run-length coding. The proposed uniqueness of the scheme involves embedding a heavy payload watermark in the chosen grayscale cover image by utilising feature extraction and data compression, with a focus on preserving perceptual transparency and robustness. Various geometric variations and noise patterns, including Gaussian, salt and pepper, rotation, and cropping, were applied to the watermarked image to ensure its attack-resistant capability. After extracting the watermarks one by one, the reversibility of the cover image has been recovered through the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a very low Mean Square Error (MSE). The proposed DWT-based scheme has achieved high perceptual transparency, as demonstrated by the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and Normalised Correlation (NC) approach, which approaches unity. The integration of CNN enhances its robustness by recovering images against various attacks, as evidenced by achieving a PSNR of about 44 dB. Additionally, high SSIM (> 0.99) and NC (similar to 1.0) values indicate enhanced perceptual transparency and robustness. The Bit error rate remained minimal post-attack, confirming reliable watermark recovery with CNN-aided restoration.

AB  - Functional connectivity (FC) analysis has emerged as a pivotal tool for identifying neural biomarkers in schizophrenia. However, existing methods often lack interpretability and fail to capture temporally dynamic causal connectivity. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Granger causality (GC)-inspired Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (cLSTM) model for diagnosing schizophrenia. Our framework integrates a dynamically learned sparsity-inducing mask within the cLSTM architecture to prioritize causal connectivity patterns while filtering out non-informative connections, thereby enhancing computational efficiency and model interpretability. We evaluated the model on the COBRE dataset across seven parcellation atlases, achieving superior performance with a mean accuracy exceeding 90% and F1-scores of up to 92%, thereby outperforming state-of-the-art methods. The GC-inspired mask reduces redundant parameters by 40%-60%, facilitating the identification of clinically relevant biomarkers, including dysregulated prefrontal-hippocampal and default mode network (DMN) interactions. By integrating temporal dependency modeling with causal inference, our approach not only enhances diagnostic accuracy but also provides neurobiologically interpretable insights into functional disruptions associated with schizophrenia. This study bridges the gap between complex deep learning (DL) models and clinically actionable tools, demonstrating significant potential for psychological healthcare applications.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of global death, with approximately 80% of such CVD mortalities occurring in low and middle-income regions. Early detection of cardiac abnormalities is essential for timely intervention and minimizing mortalities. Automated CVD detection methods are vital, particularly in areas with limited healthcare resources. However, most existing AI-based techniques lack three critical aspects: model interpretability, longer-duration analysis, and effective use of nonlinear time-frequency approaches, which are necessary for ECG signals due to their nonlinear, nonstationary, and multi-component nature. This study proposes explainable intelligent classifiers incorporated with a novel sequence of time-frequency energy Gini Index (GI) features from the QRS complexes of ECG signals to address these challenges and enable early-stage CVD detection. These features are extracted using the Choi-Williams Time-Frequency method, reporting the first instance application of GI measures to nonlinear time-frequency distribution (TFD) for ECG analysis. Features are computed from one-minute windows, covering 30 minutes of ECG recordings. These interpretable features provide clear insights into normal and abnormal ECG patterns. The proposed method was trained and validated using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia and Fantasia-Normal databases. Eight machine learning classifiers, including SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, Gaussian Na & iuml;ve Bayes, KNN, LinearBoost, CatBoost, and Logistic Regression were tested. The best model achieved 100% sensitivity, 94.4% accuracy, 95.24% F1-score, 90% precision, and 92.59% AUC on the test dataset. High sensitivity ensures reliability for medical screening by reducing False Negatives, making the approach suitable for integration into any type of smart device for accurate online and offline monitoring of CVD abnormalities.

AB  - Neural networks are becoming increasingly popular for applications in various domains, but in practice, further methods are necessary to make sure the models are learning patterns that agree with prior knowledge about the domain. A new approach introduces an explanation method, called 'expected gradients', that enables training with theoretically motivated feature attribution priors, to improve model performance on real-world tasks.
   Recent research has demonstrated that feature attribution methods for deep networks can themselves be incorporated into training; these attribution priors optimize for a model whose attributions have certain desirable properties-most frequently, that particular features are important or unimportant. These attribution priors are often based on attribution methods that are not guaranteed to satisfy desirable interpretability axioms, such as completeness and implementation invariance. Here we introduce attribution priors to optimize for higher-level properties of explanations, such as smoothness and sparsity, enabled by a fast new attribution method formulation called expected gradients that satisfies many important interpretability axioms. This improves model performance on many real-world tasks where previous attribution priors fail. Our experiments show that the gains from combining higher-level attribution priors with expected gradients attributions are consistent across image, gene expression and healthcare datasets. We believe that this work motivates and provides the necessary tools to support the widespread adoption of axiomatic attribution priors in many areas of applied machine learning. The implementations and our results have been made freely available to academic communities.

AB  - Although complex machine learning models (eg, random forest, neural networks) are commonly outperforming the traditional and simple interpretable models (eg, linear regression, decision tree), in the healthcare domain, clinicians find it hard to understand and trust these complex models due to the lack of intuition and explanation of their predictions. With the new general data protection regulation (GDPR), the importance for plausibility and verifiability of the predictions made by machine learning models has become essential. Hence, interpretability techniques for machine learning models are an area focus of research. In general, the main aim of these interpretability techniques is to shed light and provide insights into the prediction process of the machine learning models and to be able to explain how the results from the prediction was generated. A major problem in this context is that both the quality of the interpretability techniques and trust of the machine learning model predictions are challenging to measure. In this article, we propose four fundamental quantitative measures for assessing the quality of interpretability techniques-similarity, bias detection, execution time, and trust. We present a comprehensive experimental evaluation of six recent and popular local model agnostic interpretability techniques, namely, LIME, SHAP, Anchors, LORE, ILIME" and MAPLE on different types of real-world healthcare data. Building on previous work, our experimental evaluation covers different aspects for its comparison including identity, stability, separability, similarity, execution time, bias detection, and trust. The results of our experiments show that MAPLE achieves the highest performance for the identity across all data sets included in this study, while LIME achieves the lowest performance for the identity metric. LIME achieves the highest performance for the separability metric across all data sets. On average, SHAP has the smallest average time to output explanation across all data sets included in this study. For detecting the bias, SHAP and MAPLE enable the participants to better detect the bias. For the trust metric, Anchors achieves the highest performance on all data sets included in this work.

AB  - Abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract are widespread worldwide today. Generally, an effective way to diagnose these life-threatening diseases is based on endoscopy, which comprises a vast number of images. However, the main challenge in this area is that the process is time-consuming and fatiguing for a gastroenterologist to examine every image in the set. Thus, this led to the rise of studies on designing AI-based systems to assist physicians in the diagnosis. In several medical imaging tasks, deep learning methods, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have contributed to the stateof-the-art outcomes, where the complicated nonlinear relation between target classes and data can be learned and not limit to hand-crafted features. On the other hand, hyperparameters are commonly set manually, which may take a long time and leave the risk of non-optimal hyperparameters for classification. An effective tool for tuning optimal hyperparameters of deep CNN is Bayesian optimization. However, due to the complexity of the CNN, the network can be regarded as a black-box model where the information stored within it is hard to interpret. Hence, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques are applied to overcome this issue by interpreting the decisions of the CNNs in such wise the physicians can trust. To play an essential role in real-time medical diagnosis, CNN-based models need to be accurate and interpretable, while the uncertainty must be handled. Therefore, a novel method comprising of three phases is proposed to classify these life-threatening diseases. At first, hyperparameter tuning is performed using Bayesian optimization for two state-of-the-art deep CNNs, and then Darknet53 and InceptionV3 features are extracted from these fine-tunned models. Secondly, XAI techniques are used to interpret which part of the images CNN takes for feature extraction. At last, the features are fused, and uncertainties are handled by selecting entropy based features. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods by achieving an accuracy of 97% based on a Bayesian optimized Support Vector Machine classifier.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to have a tremendous impact on patients and healthcare systems around the world. In the fight against this novel disease, there is a pressing need for rapid and effective screening tools to identify patients infected with COVID-19, and to this end CT imaging has been proposed as one of the key screening methods which may be used as a complement to RT-PCR testing, particularly in situations where patients undergo routine CT scans for non-COVID-19 related reasons, patients have worsening respiratory status or developing complications that require expedited care, or patients are suspected to be COVID-19-positive but have negative RT-PCR test results. Early studies on CT-based screening have reported abnormalities in chest CT images which are characteristic of COVID-19 infection, but these abnormalities may be difficult to distinguish from abnormalities caused by other lung conditions. Motivated by this, in this study we introduce COVIDNet-CT, a deep convolutional neural network architecture that is tailored for detection of COVID-19 cases from chest CT images via a machine-driven design exploration approach. Additionally, we introduce COVIDx-CT, a benchmark CT image dataset derived from CT imaging data collected by the China National Center for Bioinformation comprising 104,009 images across 1,489 patient cases. Furthermore, in the interest of reliability and transparency, we leverage an explainability-driven performance validation strategy to investigate the decision-making behavior of COVIDNet-CT, and in doing so ensure that COVIDNet-CT makes predictions based on relevant indicators in CT images. Both COVIDNet-CT and the COVIDx-CT dataset are available to the general public in an open-source and open access manner as part of the COVID-Net initiative. While COVIDNet-CT is not yet a production-ready screening solution, we hope that releasing the model and dataset will encourage researchers, clinicians, and citizen data scientists alike to leverage and build upon them.

AB  - Purpose Recommending suitable doctors to patients on healthcare consultation platforms is important to both the patients and the platforms. Although doctor recommendation methods have been proposed, they failed to explain recommendations and address the data sparsity problem, i.e. most patients on the platforms are new and provide little information except disease descriptions. This research aims to develop an interpretable doctor recommendation method based on knowledge graph and interpretable deep learning techniques to fill the research gaps. Design/methodology/approach This research proposes an advanced doctor recommendation method that leverages a health knowledge graph to overcome the data sparsity problem and uses deep learning techniques to generate accurate and interpretable recommendations. The proposed method extracts interactive features from the knowledge graph to indicate implicit interactions between patients and doctors and identifies individual features that signal the doctors' service quality. Then, the authors feed the features into a deep neural network with layer-wise relevance propagation to generate readily usable and interpretable recommendation results. Findings The proposed method produces more accurate recommendations than diverse baseline methods and can provide interpretations for the recommendations. Originality/value This study proposes a novel doctor recommendation method. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the method in generating accurate and interpretable recommendations. The research provides a practical solution and some managerial implications to online platforms that confront information overload and transparency issues.

AB  - This study trained long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNNs) incorporating an attention mechanism to predict daily sepsis, myocardial infarction (MI), and vancomycin antibiotic administration over two week patient ICU courses in the MIMIC-III dataset. These models achieved next-day predictive AUC of 0.876 for sepsis, 0.823 for MI, and 0.833 for vancomycin administration. Attention maps built from these models highlighted those times when input variables most influenced predictions and could provide a degree of interpretability to clinicians. These models appeared to attend to variables that were proxies for clinician decision-making, demonstrating a challenge of using flexible deep learning approaches trained with EHR data to build clinical decision support. While continued development and refinement is needed, we believe that such models could one day prove useful in reducing information overload for ICU physicians by providing needed clinical decision support for a variety of clinically important tasks.

AB  - Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) affects about 20-30% of the adult population in developed countries and is an increasingly important cause of hepatocellular carcinoma. Liver ultrasound (US) is widely used as a noninvasive method to diagnose NAFLD. However, the intensive use of US is not cost-effective and increases the burden on the healthcare system. Electronic medical records facilitate large-scale epidemiological studies and, existing NAFLD scores often require clinical and anthropometric parameters that may not be captured in those databases. Our goal was to develop and validate a simple Neural Network (NN)-based web app that could be used to predict NAFLD particularly its absence. The study included 2970 subjects; training and testing of the neural network using a train-test-split approach was done on 2869 of them. From another population consisting of 2301 subjects, a further 100 subjects were randomly extracted to test the web app. A search was made to find the best parameters for the NN and then this NN was exported for incorporation into a local web app. The percentage of accuracy, area under the ROC curve, confusion matrix, Positive (PPV) and Negative Predicted Value (NPV) values, precision, recall and f1-score were verified. After that, Explainability (XAI) was analyzed to understand the diagnostic reasoning of the NN. Finally, in the local web app, the specificity and sensitivity values were checked. The NN achieved a percentage of accuracy during testing of 77.0%, with an area under the ROC curve value of 0.82. Thus, in the web app the NN evidenced to achieve good results, with a specificity of 1.00 and sensitivity of 0.73. The described approach can be used to support NAFLD diagnosis, reducing healthcare costs. The NN-based web app is easy to apply and the required parameters are easily found in healthcare databases.

AB  - To improve the performance of Intensive Care Units (ICUs), the field of bio-statistics has developed scores which try to predict the likelihood of negative outcomes. These help evaluate the effectiveness of treatments and clinical practice, and also help to identify patients with unexpected outcomes. However, they have been shown by several studies to offer sub-optimal performance. Alternatively, Deep Learning offers state of the art capabilities in certain prediction tasks and research suggests deep neural networks are able to outperform traditional techniques. Nevertheless, a main impediment for the adoption of Deep Learning in healthcare is its reduced interpretability, for in this field it is crucial to gain insight into the why of predictions, to assure that models are actually learning relevant features instead of spurious correlations. To address this, we propose a deep multiscale convolutional architecture trained on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) for mortality prediction, and the use of concepts from coalitional game theory to construct visual explanations aimed to show how important these inputs are deemed by the network. Results show our model attains a ROC AUC of 0.8735 (+/- 0.0025) which is competitive with the state of the art of Deep Learning mortality models trained on MIMIC-III data, while remaining interpretable.

AB  - Late-arriving patients have become a prominent concern in several ambulatory care clinics across the globe. Accommodating them could lead to detrimental ramifications such as schedule disruption and increased waiting time for forthcoming patients, which, in turn, could lead to patient dissatisfaction, reduced care quality, and physician burnout. However, rescheduling late arrivals could delay access to care. This paper aims to predict the patient-specific risk of late arrival using machine learning (ML) models. Data from two different ambulatory care facilities are extracted, and a comprehensive list of predictor variables is identified or derived from the electronic medical records. A comparative analysis of four ML algorithms (logistic regression, random forests, gradient boosting machine, and artificial neural networks) that differ in their training mechanism is conducted. The results indicate that ML algorithms can accurately predict patient lateness, but a single model cannot perform best with respect to predictive performance, training time, and interpretability. Prior history of late arrivals, age, and afternoon appointments are identified as critical predictors by all the models. The ML-based approach presented in this research can serve as a decision support tool and could be integrated into the appointment system for effectively managing and mitigating tardy arrivals.

AB  - With the rapid development of AI techniques, Computer-aided Diagnosis has attracted much attention and has been successfully deployed in many applications of health care and medical diagnosis. For some specific tasks, the learning-based system can compare with or even outperform human experts' performance. The impressive performance owes to the excellent expressiveness and scalability of the neural networks, although the models' intuition usually cannot be represented explicitly. Interpretability is, however, very important, even the same as the diagnosis precision, for computer-aided diagnosis. To fill this gap, our approach is intuitive to detect pneumonia interpretably. We first build a large dataset of community-acquired pneumonia consisting of 35389 cases (distinguished from nosocomial pneumonia) based on actual medical records. Second, we train a prediction model with the chest X-ray images in our dataset, capable of precisely detecting pneumonia. Third, we propose an intuitive approach to combine neural networks with an explainable model such as the Bayesian Network. The experiment result shows that our proposal further improves the performance by using multi-source data and provides intuitive explanations for the diagnosis results.

AB  - The emergence of digital technologies such as smartphones in healthcare applications have demonstrated the possibility of developing rich, continuous, and objective measures of multiple sclerosis (MS) disability that can be administered remotely and out-of-clinic. Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) may capture a richer representation of healthy and MS-related ambulatory characteristics from the raw smartphone-based inertial sensor data than standard feature-based methodologies. To overcome the typical limitations associated with remotely generated health data, such as low subject numbers, sparsity, and heterogeneous data, a transfer learning (TL) model from similar large open-source datasets was proposed. Our TL framework leveraged the ambulatory information learned on human activity recognition (HAR) tasks collected from wearable smartphone sensor data. It was demonstrated that fine-tuning TL DCNN HAR models towards MS disease recognition tasks outperformed previous Support Vector Machine (SVM) feature-based methods, as well as DCNN models trained end-to-end, by upwards of 8-15%. A lack of transparency of "black-box" deep networks remains one of the largest stumbling blocks to the wider acceptance of deep learning for clinical applications. Ensuing work therefore aimed to visualise DCNN decisions attributed by relevance heatmaps using Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP). Through the LRP framework, the patterns captured from smartphone-based inertial sensor data that were reflective of those who are healthy versus people with MS (PwMS) could begin to be established and understood. Interpretations suggested that cadence-based measures, gait speed, and ambulation-related signal perturbations were distinct characteristics that distinguished MS disability from healthy participants. Robust and interpretable outcomes, generated from high-frequency out-of-clinic assessments, could greatly augment the current in-clinic assessment picture for PwMS, to inform better disease management techniques, and enable the development of better therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Background Imaging examinations, such as ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography scans, play key roles in healthcare settings. To assess and improve the quality of imaging diagnosis, we need to manually find and compare the pre-existing reports of imaging and pathology examinations which contain overlapping exam body sites from electrical medical records (EMRs). The process of retrieving those reports is time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) based method which can better utilize semantic information contained in report texts to accelerate the retrieving process. Methods We included 16,354 imaging and pathology report-pairs from 1926 patients who admitted to Shanghai Tongren Hospital and had ultrasonic examinations between 1st May 2017 and 31st July 2017. We adapted the CNN model to calculate the similarities among the report-pairs to identify target report-pairs with overlapping body sites, and compared the performance with other six conventional models, including keyword mapping, latent semantic analysis (LSA), latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), Doc2Vec, Siamese long short term memory (LSTM) and a model based on named entity recognition (NER). We also utilized graph embedding method to enhance the word representation by capturing the semantic relations information from medical ontologies. Additionally, we used LIME algorithm to identify which features (or words) are decisive for the prediction results and improved the model interpretability. Results Experiment results showed that our CNN model gained significant improvement compared to all other conventional models on area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC), precision, recall and F1-score in our test dataset. The AUROC of our CNN models gained approximately 3-7% improvement. The AUROC of CNN model with graph-embedding and ontology based medical concept vectors was 0.8% higher than the model with randomly initialized vectors and 1.5% higher than the one with pre-trained word vectors. Conclusion Our study demonstrates that CNN model with pre-trained medical concept vectors could accurately identify target report-pairs with overlapping body sites and potentially accelerate the retrieving process for imaging diagnosis quality measurement.

AB  - The U.S. government procures more than $500 billion annually in goods and services on public contracts, which it classifies using a hierarchical product and service taxonomy. Classification serves several purposes, including transparency in the use of taxpayer funding; reporting, tracing, and segmenting government expenditures; budget-ing; and forecasting. Government acquisition personnel have historically performed these classifications manually, resulting in a process that is time-consuming and error-prone and offers limited visibility into government purchases. The problem faced is not unique to the public sector and is common across retail, manufacturing, and healthcare, among other settings. Using almost 4 million historical data records on governmental purchases, we fit a series of classifiers and demonstrate (a) superior performance when explicitly modeling the hierarchical structure of information domains through the use of top-down strategies and (b) the effectiveness of character-level convolutional neural networks when textual inputs are terse and contain irregularities such as abnormal character combinations and misspellings, which are common in government contracts. Our machine learning models are embedded in multiple software applications, including a web application that we developed, used by federal government personnel and other contracting professionals.

AB  - Background Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare settings has the potential to benefit clinical decision-making. Addressing challenges such as ensuring trustworthiness, mitigating bias, and maintaining safety is paramount. The lack of established methodologies for pre- and post-deployment evaluation of AI tools regarding crucial attributes such as transparency, performance monitoring, and adverse event reporting makes this situation challenging.Objectives This paper aims to make practical suggestions for creating methods, rules, and guidelines to ensure that the development, testing, supervision, and use of AI in clinical decision support (CDS) systems are done well and safely for patients.Materials and Methods In May 2023, the Division of Clinical Informatics at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and the American Medical Informatics Association co-sponsored a working group on AI in healthcare. In August 2023, there were 4 webinars on AI topics and a 2-day workshop in September 2023 for consensus-building. The event included over 200 industry stakeholders, including clinicians, software developers, academics, ethicists, attorneys, government policy experts, scientists, and patients. The goal was to identify challenges associated with the trusted use of AI-enabled CDS in medical practice. Key issues were identified, and solutions were proposed through qualitative analysis and a 4-month iterative consensus process.Results Our work culminated in several key recommendations: (1) building safe and trustworthy systems; (2) developing validation, verification, and certification processes for AI-CDS systems; (3) providing a means of safety monitoring and reporting at the national level; and (4) ensuring that appropriate documentation and end-user training are provided.Discussion AI-enabled Clinical Decision Support (AI-CDS) systems promise to revolutionize healthcare decision-making, necessitating a comprehensive framework for their development, implementation, and regulation that emphasizes trustworthiness, transparency, and safety. This framework encompasses various aspects including model training, explainability, validation, certification, monitoring, and continuous evaluation, while also addressing challenges such as data privacy, fairness, and the need for regulatory oversight to ensure responsible integration of AI into clinical workflow.Conclusions Achieving responsible AI-CDS systems requires a collective effort from many healthcare stakeholders. This involves implementing robust safety, monitoring, and transparency measures while fostering innovation. Future steps include testing and piloting proposed trust mechanisms, such as safety reporting protocols, and establishing best practice guidelines.

AB  - Improving the drug development process can expedite the introduction of more novel drugs that cater to the demands of precision medicine. Accurately predicting molecular properties remains a fundamental challenge in drug discovery and development. Currently, a plethora of computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) methods have been widely employed in the field of molecular prediction. However, most of these methods primarily analyze molecules using low-dimensional representations such as SMILES notations, molecular fingerprints, and molecular graph-based descriptors. Only a few approaches have focused on incorporating and utilizing high-dimensional spatial structural representations of molecules. In light of the advancements in artificial intelligence, we introduce a 3D graph-spatial co-representation model called AEGNN-M, which combines two graph neural networks, GAT and EGNN. AEGNN-M enables learning of information from both molecular graphs representations and 3D spatial structural representations to predict molecular properties accurately. We conducted experiments on seven public datasets, three regression datasets and 14 breast cancer cell line phenotype screening datasets, comparing the performance of AEGNN-M with state-of-the-art deep learning methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the satisfactory performance of the AEGNN-M model. Furthermore, we analyzed the performance impact of different modules within AEGNN-M and the influence of spatial structural representations on the model's performance. The interpretability analysis also revealed the significance of specific atoms in determining particular molecular properties.

AB  - Importance Artificial intelligence (AI) has gained considerable attention in health care, yet concerns have been raised around appropriate methods and fairness. Current AI reporting guidelines do not provide a means of quantifying overall quality of AI research, limiting their ability to compare models addressing the same clinical question.Objective To develop a tool (APPRAISE-AI) to evaluate the methodological and reporting quality of AI prediction models for clinical decision support.Design, Setting, and Participants This quality improvement study evaluated AI studies in the model development, silent, and clinical trial phases using the APPRAISE-AI tool, a quantitative method for evaluating quality of AI studies across 6 domains: clinical relevance, data quality, methodological conduct, robustness of results, reporting quality, and reproducibility. These domains included 24 items with a maximum overall score of 100 points. Points were assigned to each item, with higher points indicating stronger methodological or reporting quality. The tool was applied to a systematic review on machine learning to estimate sepsis that included articles published until September 13, 2019. Data analysis was performed from September to December 2022.Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcomes were interrater and intrarater reliability and the correlation between APPRAISE-AI scores and expert scores, 3-year citation rate, number of Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) low risk-of-bias domains, and overall adherence to the Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) statement.Results A total of 28 studies were included. Overall APPRAISE-AI scores ranged from 33 (low quality) to 67 (high quality). Most studies were moderate quality. The 5 lowest scoring items included source of data, sample size calculation, bias assessment, error analysis, and transparency. Overall APPRAISE-AI scores were associated with expert scores (Spearman rho, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.64-0.91; P < .001), 3-year citation rate (Spearman rho, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.43-0.85; P < .001), number of QUADAS-2 low risk-of-bias domains (Spearman rho, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.24-0.77; P = .002), and adherence to the TRIPOD statement (Spearman rho, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.73-0.94; P < .001). Intraclass correlation coefficient ranges for interrater and intrarater reliability were 0.74 to 1.00 for individual items, 0.81 to 0.99 for individual domains, and 0.91 to 0.98 for overall scores.Conclusions and Relevance In this quality improvement study, APPRAISE-AI demonstrated strong interrater and intrarater reliability and correlated well with several study quality measures. This tool may provide a quantitative approach for investigators, reviewers, editors, and funding organizations to compare the research quality across AI studies for clinical decision support.

AB  - Objective. Breast cancer is the major cause of cancer death among women worldwide. Deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems for classifying lesions in breast ultrasound images can help materialise the early detection of breast cancer and enhance survival chances. Approach. This paper presents a completely automated BUS diagnosis system with modular convolutional neural networks tuned with novel loss functions. The proposed network comprises a dynamic channel input enhancement network, an attention-guided InceptionV3-based feature extraction network, a classification network, and a parallel feature transformation network to map deep features into quantitative ultrasound (QUS) feature space. These networks function together to improve classification accuracy by increasing the separation of benign and malignant class-specific features and enriching them simultaneously. Unlike the categorical crossentropy (CCE) loss-based traditional approaches, our method uses two additional novel losses: class activation mapping (CAM)-based and QUS feature-based losses, to capacitate the overall network learn the extraction of clinically valued lesion shape and texture-related properties focusing primarily the lesion area for explainable AI (XAI). Main results. Experiments on four public, one private, and a combined breast ultrasound dataset are used to validate our strategy. The suggested technique obtains an accuracy of 97.28%, sensitivity of 93.87%, F1-score of 95.42% on dataset 1 (BUSI), and an accuracy of 91.50%, sensitivity of 89.38%, and F1-score of 89.31% on the combined dataset, consisting of 1494 images collected from hospitals in five demographic locations using four ultrasound systems of different manufacturers. These results outperform techniques reported in the literature by a considerable margin. Significance. The proposed CAD system provides diagnosis from the auto-focused lesion area of B-mode BUS images, avoiding the explicit requirement of any segmentation or region of interest extraction, and thus can be a handy tool for making accurate and reliable diagnoses even in unspecialized healthcare centers.

AB  - Deep neural networks (DNNs) have greatly advanced the ability to predict genome function from sequence. However, elucidating underlying biological mechanisms from genomic DNNs remains challenging. Existing interpretability methods, such as attribution maps, have their origins in non-biological machine learning applications and therefore have the potential to be improved by incorporating domain-specific interpretation strategies. Here we introduce SQUID (Surrogate Quantitative Interpretability for Deepnets), a genomic DNN interpretability framework based on domain-specific surrogate modelling. SQUID approximates genomic DNNs in user-specified regions of sequence space using surrogate models-simpler quantitative models that have inherently interpretable mathematical forms. SQUID leverages domain knowledge to model cis-regulatory mechanisms in genomic DNNs, in particular by removing the confounding effects that nonlinearities and heteroscedastic noise in functional genomics data can have on model interpretation. Benchmarking analysis on multiple genomic DNNs shows that SQUID, when compared to established interpretability methods, identifies motifs that are more consistent across genomic loci and yields improved single-nucleotide variant-effect predictions. SQUID also supports surrogate models that quantify epistatic interactions within and between cis-regulatory elements, as well as global explanations of cis-regulatory mechanisms across sequence contexts. SQUID thus advances the ability to mechanistically interpret genomic DNNs. The intersection of genomics and deep learning shows promise for real impact on healthcare and biological research, but the lack of interpretability in terms of biological mechanisms is limiting utility and further development. As a potential solution, Koo et al. present SQUID, an interpretability framework built using domain-specific genomic surrogate models.

AB  - Objective The objective of this research is to enhance pneumonia detection in chest X-rays by leveraging a novel hybrid deep learning model that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with modified Swin Transformer blocks. This study aims to significantly improve diagnostic accuracy, reduce misclassifications, and provide a robust, deployable solution for underdeveloped regions where access to conventional diagnostics and treatment is limited.Methods The study developed a hybrid model architecture integrating CNNs with modified Swin Transformer blocks to work seamlessly within the same model. The CNN layers perform initial feature extraction, capturing local patterns within the images. At the same time, the modified Swin Transformer blocks handle long-range dependencies and global context through window-based self-attention mechanisms. Preprocessing steps included resizing images to 224x224 pixels and applying Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) to enhance image features. Data augmentation techniques, such as horizontal flipping, rotation, and zooming, were utilized to prevent overfitting and ensure model robustness. Hyperparameter optimization was conducted using Optuna, employing Bayesian optimization (Tree-structured Parzen Estimator) to fine-tune key parameters of both the CNN and Swin Transformer components, ensuring optimal model performance.Results The proposed hybrid model was trained and validated on a dataset provided by the Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center. The model achieved an overall accuracy of 98.72% and a loss of 0.064 on an unseen dataset, significantly outperforming a baseline CNN model. Detailed performance metrics indicated a precision of 0.9738 for the normal class and 1.0000 for the pneumonia class, with an overall F1-score of 0.9872. The hybrid model consistently outperformed the CNN model across all performance metrics, demonstrating higher accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Confusion matrices revealed high sensitivity and specificity with minimal misclassifications.Conclusion The proposed hybrid CNN-ViT model, which integrates modified Swin Transformer blocks within the CNN architecture, provides a significant advancement in pneumonia detection by effectively capturing both local and global features within chest X-ray images. The modifications to the Swin Transformer blocks enable them to work seamlessly with the CNN layers, enhancing the model's ability to understand complex visual patterns and dependencies. This results in superior classification performance. The lightweight design of the model eliminates the need for extensive hardware, facilitating easy deployment in resource-constrained settings. This innovative approach not only improves pneumonia diagnosis but also has the potential to enhance patient outcomes and support healthcare providers in underdeveloped regions. Future research will focus on further refining the model architecture, incorporating more advanced image processing techniques, and exploring explainable AI methods to provide deeper insights into the model's decision-making process.

AB  - Disease diagnosis is the identification of an health issue, disease, disorder, or other condition that a person may have. Disease diagnoses could be sometimes very easy tasks, while others may be a bit trickier. There are large data sets available; however, there is a limitation of tools that can accurately determine the patterns and make predictions. The traditional methods which are used to diagnose a disease are manual and error-prone. Usage of Artificial Intelligence (AI) predictive techniques enables auto diagnosis and reduces detection errors compared to exclusive human expertise. In this paper, we have reviewed the current literature for the last 10 years, from January 2009 to December 2019. The study considered eight most frequently used databases, in which a total of 105 articles were found. A detailed analysis of those articles was conducted in order to classify most used AI techniques for medical diagnostic systems. We further discuss various diseases along with corresponding techniques of AI, including Fuzzy Logic, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. This research paper aims to reveal some important insights into current and previous different AI techniques in the medical field used in today's medical research, particularly in heart disease prediction, brain disease, prostate, liver disease, and kidney disease. Finally, the paper also provides some avenues for future research on AI-based diagnostics systems based on a set of open problems and challenges.

AB  - Background and Objective: In recent years, machine learning-based clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have played a key role in the analysis of several medical conditions. Despite their promising capabilities, the lack of transparency in AI models poses significant challenges, particularly in medical contexts where reliability is a mandatory aspect. However, it appears that explainability is inversely proportional to accuracy. For this reason, achieving transparency without compromising predictive accuracy remains a key challenge. Methods: This paper presents a novel method, namely Rad4XCNN, to enhance the predictive power of CNN- derived features with the inherent interpretability of radiomic features. Rad4XCNN diverges from conventional methods based on saliency maps, by associating intelligible meaning to CNN-derived features by means of Radiomics, offering new perspectives on explanation methods beyond visualization maps. Results: Using abreast cancer classification task as a case study, we evaluated Rad4XCNN on ultrasound imaging datasets, including an online dataset and two in-house datasets for internal and external validation. Some key results are: (i) CNN-derived features guarantee more robust accuracy when compared against ViTderived and radiomic features; (ii) conventional visualization map methods for explanation present several pitfalls; (iii) Rad4XCNN does not sacrifice model accuracy for their explainability; (iv) Rad4XCNN provides a global explanation enabling the physician to extract global insights and findings. Conclusions: Our method can mitigate some concerns related to the explainability-accuracy trade-off. This study highlighted the importance of proposing new methods for model explanation without affecting their accuracy.

AB  - The accurate prediction of heart disease is crucial in the field of medicine. While convolutional neural networks have shown remarkable precision in heart disease prediction, they are often perceived as opaque models due to their complex internal workings. This paper introduces a novel method, named Extraction of Classification Rules from Convolutional Neural Network (ECRCNN), aimed at extracting rules from convolutional neural networks to enhance interpretability in heart disease prediction. The ECRCNN algorithm analyses updated kernels to derive understandable rules from convolutional neural networks, providing valuable insights into the contributing factors of heart disease. The algorithm's performance is assessed using the Statlog (Heart) dataset from the University of California, Irvine's repository. Experimental results underscore the effectiveness of the ECRCNN algorithm in predicting heart disease and extracting meaningful rules. The extracted rules can assist healthcare professionals in making precise diagnoses and formulating targeted treatment plans. In summary, the proposed method bridges the gap between the high accuracy of convolutional neural networks and the interpretability necessary for informed decision-making in heart disease prediction.

AB  - Cervical cancer (CCa) is the fourth most prevalent and common cancer affecting women worldwide, with increasing incidence and mortality rates. Hence, early detection of CCa plays a crucial role in improving outcomes. Non-invasive imaging procedures with good diagnostic performance are desirable and have the potential to lessen the degree of intervention associated with the gold standard, biopsy. Recently, artificial intelligence-based diagnostic models such as Vision Transformers (ViT) have shown promising performance in image classification tasks, rivaling or surpassing traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This paper studies the effect of applying a ViT to predict CCa using different image benchmark datasets. A newly developed approach (ViT-PSO-SVM) was presented for boosting the results of the ViT based on integrating the ViT with particle swarm optimization (PSO), and support vector machine (SVM). First, the proposed framework extracts features from the Vision Transformer. Then, PSO is used to reduce the complexity of extracted features and optimize feature representation. Finally, a softmax classification layer is replaced with an SVM classification model to precisely predict CCa. The models are evaluated using two benchmark cervical cell image datasets, namely SipakMed and Herlev, with different classification scenarios: two, three, and five classes. The proposed approach achieved 99.112% accuracy and 99.113% F1-score for SipakMed with two classes and achieved 97.778% accuracy and 97.805% F1-score for Herlev with two classes outperforming other Vision Transformers, CNN models, and pre-trained models. Finally, GradCAM is used as an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) tool to visualize and understand the regions of a given image that are important for a model's prediction. The obtained experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of the developed ViT-PSO-SVM approach and hold the promise of providing a robust, reliable, accurate, and non-invasive diagnostic tool that will lead to improved healthcare outcomes worldwide.

AB  - Background: Early identification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential for optimal treatment and management. Deep learning (DL) technologies, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) can provide promising outcomes in AD diagnosis. However, these technologies lack model interpretability and demand substantial computational resources, causing challenges in the resource-constrained environment. Hybrid ViTs can outperform individual ViTs by visualizing key features with limited computational power. This synergy enhances feature extraction and promotes model interpretability. Objectives: Thus, the authors present an innovative model for classifying AD using MRI images with limited computational resources. Methods: The authors improved the AD feature-extraction process by modifying the existing ViTs. A CatBoost-based classifier was used to classify the extracted features into multiple classes. Results: The proposed model was generalized using the OASIS dataset. The model obtained an exceptional classification accuracy of 98.8% with a minimal loss of 0.12. Conclusions: The findings highlight the potential of the proposed AD classification model in providing an interpretable and resource-efficient solution for healthcare centers. To improve model robustness and applicability, subsequent research can include genetic and clinical data.

AB  - We have recently seen many successful applications of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on electronic medical records (EMRs), which contain histories of patients' diagnoses, medications, and other various events, in order to predict the current and future states of patients. Despite the strong performance of RNNs, it is often challenging for users to understand why the model makes a particular prediction. Such black-box nature of RNNs can impede its wide adoption in clinical practice. Furthermore, we have no established methods to interactively leverage users' domain expertise and prior knowledge as inputs for steering the model. Therefore, our design study aims to provide a visual analytics solution to increase interpretability and interactivity of RNNs via a joint effort of medical experts, artificial intelligence scientists, and visual analytics researchers. Following the iterative design process between the experts, we design, implement, and evaluate a visual analytics tool called RetainVis, which couples a newly improved, interpretable, and interactive RNN-based model called RetainEX and visualizations for users' exploration of EMR data in the context of prediction tasks. Our study shows the effective use of RetainVis for gaining insights into how individual medical codes contribute to making risk predictions, using EMRs of patients with heart failure and cataract symptoms. Our study also demonstrates how we made substantial changes to the state-of-the-art RNN model called RETAIN in order to make use of temporal information and increase interactivity. This study will provide a useful guideline for researchers that aim to design an interpretable and interactive visual analytics tool for RNNs.

AB  - The increasing prevalence of cyber threats in healthcare necessitates robust security measures to protect sensitive medical data. This research presents a hybrid security framework integrating blockchain for decentralized, immutable data storage and an intrusion detection system (IDS) leveraging a multi-attention deep convolutional recurrent neural network (MA-DeepCRNN) model for advanced threat detection. The proposed IDS combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for spatial feature extraction, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for temporal pattern recognition, and an attention mechanism to enhance critical data representation. The model is evaluated using the CICIoMT 2024 benchmark dataset. The blockchain architecture achieves a block creation time of 10 s, improving significantly over Bitcoin (similar to 600 s) and Ethereum (similar to 15 s), while increasing throughput to similar to 182 transactions per second. Security analysis indicates a low transaction reversal probability of < 0.1%. The IDS demonstrates high classification performance, achieving 99.49% accuracy in binary classification, 99.12% in multiclass (6-class) classification, and 98.56% in large-scale (19-class) classification. Comparative analysis with state-of-the-art approaches highlights improvements in accuracy and F1-score by 3.44 and 3.71%, respectively, for intrusion detection in Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) systems. These results underscore the effectiveness of the proposed framework in enhancing security, scalability, and real-time threat detection in healthcare environments.

AB  - Stroke is a disease of the central nervous system that occurs very quickly. The onset of the disease can lead to severe neurological deficits and, in the acute phase, death. The National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Barthel Index (BI), and Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) are the best tools for evaluating whether or not a stroke patient will improve at the time of onset and in the future. This study investigated the collection of patient demographics, CT imaging findings, MRI imaging findings, and NIHSS, Barthel, and mRS to determine whether a stroke patient is likely to get better at the time of onset and at the time of prognosis, and since previous studies have used artificial intelligence models to predict only one indicator, this will result in more time spent on prediction. This study investigates the collection of patient demographics, CT imaging findings, MRI imaging findings, and NIHSS, BI, and mRS indices on admission, and compares whether the four models can have good predictive effect in predicting the predicted values of the three indices at one time. Finally, the explainable models were used to explore which of the parameters were more important for us to predict the predicted values of the indicators. The results of the study showed that deep convolutional neural networks yielded better predictive results in both the training sample set and the validation dataset: post-discharge NIHSS: 86.18, 9.28, 7.38; post-discharge BI: 664.69, 25.78, 17.84; and post-discharge BmRS: 3.83, 1.96, 1.63, respectively. The present study showed that the top five important characteristics were Contralateral (Contra) Common Carotid Artery (CCA) Pulsatility Index (PI), Ipsilateral (Ipsi) External Carotid A (ECA) Resistance Index (RI), Hypoperfusion Intensity Ratio (HIR), inpatient CT Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS), and Ipsi ECA PI. Therefore, this study found a new model that can validate the values of these three indicators after discharge and inform healthcare professionals about the importance of each value for the implementation of follow-up programs.

AB  - The rapid growth of data-driven applications is ubiquitous across virtually all scientific domains, led to an increasing demand for effective methods to handle data deficiencies and mitigate the imperfect data. This paper presents a guide for researchers encountering real-world data-driven applications, and the respective challenges associated with this. This article proposes the concept of the Data Paradigm, combining the principles of machine learning, data science and data assimilation to tackle challenges in data-driven applications. Models area product of the data upon which they are trained, data collected from real world scenarios is perfect due to natural limitations of sensing and collection. computational modelling of real world systems is intrinsically limited by the various deficiencies encountered in real data. The Data Learning Paradigm aims to leverage the strengths of data improvement to the accuracy, reliability, and interpretability of data-driven models. We outline a range of methods are currently being implemented in the field of Data Learning involving machine learning and data methods, and discuss how these mitigate the various problems associated with data-driven models, illustrating improved results in a multitude of real world applications. We highlight examples where these methods led to significant advancements infields such as environmental monitoring, planetary exploration, healthcare analytics, linguistic analysis, social networks, and smart manufacturing. We offer a guide to how these may be implemented to deal with general types of limitations in data, alongside their current and applications.

AB  - Healthcare practices include collecting all kinds of patient data which would help the doctor correctly diagnose the health condition of the patient. These data could be simple symptoms observed by the subject, initial diagnosis by a physician or a detailed test result from a laboratory. Thus, these data are only utilized for analysis by a doctor who then ascertains the disease using his/her personal medical expertise. The artificial intelligence has been used with Naive Bayes classification and random forest classification algorithm to classify many disease datasets like diabetes, heart disease, and cancer to check whether the patient is affected by that disease or not. A performance analysis of the disease data for both algorithms is calculated and compared. The results of the simulations show the effectiveness of the classification techniques on a dataset, as well as the nature and complexity of the dataset used.

AB  - COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease that can quickly spread and overwhelm healthcare systems if not controlled in time. Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) is commonly used to diagnose COVID-19 but has low sensitivity and can be time-consuming. Computed Tomography (CT) scans can identify specific lung patterns or abnormalities associated with COVID-19 infection, which can help diagnose the disease. This paper presents an efficient forecasting framework for COVID-19 based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to aid medical professionals in diagnosing COVID-19. The proposed framework was trained on the online COVID-19 dataset from Kaggle, which was split into train, validation, and test sets. The CNN achieved an accuracy of 99.11% on the test set. K-fold cross-validation was applied to the CNN, resulting in an average accuracy of 97.2%. The research explores alternative Machine Learning (ML) models, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbour, and Random Forest, alongside Deep CNNs like ResNet50, VGG16, and InceptionV3 for COVID-19 prediction. The CNN model underwent analysis using the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) method and bootstrap resampling for Confidence Interval (CI) estimation to enhance interpretability. This can help to understand the model's predictions and assess their uncertainty. The developed CNN model, optimized for reduced memory usage, was seamlessly deployed on the Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) cloud. Post-deployment, an accessible Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) link facilitates mobile phone accessibility, offering a user-friendly interface for widespread utilization. The proposed CNN-based forecasting framework is a promising tool for improving the accuracy and accessibility of COVID-19 diagnosis.

AB  - The advent of smart healthcare has significantly heightened the importance of computer technologies in supporting medical diagnosis and treatment. Nevertheless, the challenges of mining latent knowledge within diagnostic data and explaining results to healthcare professionals have limited the application of many algorithms like neural network in clinical practice. To address these issues, our study introduces an Interpretable Predictor with Deep Convolutional Fuzzy Neural Network (IP-DCFNN). The proposed model is capable of assessing disease risks based on individual data and providing interpretable justifications aiding medical diagnosis and treatment decisions. By deconstructing the fuzzy inference process and incorporating convolutional neural network, our approach enhances the ability to discover underlying information while maintaining transparency and interpretability. Furthermore, we introduce a grid partition-based method for initializing the antecedent parameters and a hybrid approach that combines gradient descent with least squares estimation for training. Compared with Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Our model has an average improvement of 7.4% on prediction accuracy. More importantly, it can extract interpretable insights from membership functions, rule bases, and fuzzy contributions, offering valuable knowledge for medical research on type 2 diabetes, supporting intelligent diagnostic processes and providing personalized healthcare recommendations. The model can also be applied on the diagnosis and treatment of various other diseases.

AB  - Due to the high classification accuracy and fast computational speed offered by Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), they have been widely used for the design and development of automated Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools for the detection of various diseases. These tools, which are intensive computational learning models, hold tremendous significance in healthcare for identifying various diseases. The primary goal of this review is to understand the applicability and methodology for implementing DNNs, including computational costs, for the classification of distinct diseases from disparate medical imaging datasets. This study presents an extensive survey of DNNs along with their various hybridization forms. To achieve this, the research papers surveyed have been grouped into five categories: pretrained DNNs, hyperparameter-tuned optimized DNNs, hybrid DNNs and ML classifiers, hybrid models with optimization techniques, and meta-heuristics based feature selection DNNs. The major part of this review highlights the significant role of nature-inspired meta-heuristic techniques used for hyperparameter optimization or feature selection algorithms of DNNs. Besides the frameworks and computational costs, descriptions of disparate medical image datasets and image preprocessing techniques have also been discussed under each category. Furthermore, a comparative analysis for each category has been performed on the basis of different parameters, including the type and size of datasets used, image preprocessing, methodology (as per the mentioned category), and performance (in terms of classification accuracy). This study also presents a bibliometric analysis based on the publication count of various articles related to hyperparameter-tuned optimized DNNs and meta-heuristic based feature selection DNNs. This review aims to assist potential AI researchers in choosing the most sound and appropriate DNN-based techniques for disease detection and prediction, all consolidated into a one single research paper.

AB  - Prostate cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality worldwide, with diagnostic challenges magnified in underrepresented regions like sub-Saharan Africa. This study introduces a novel application of ConvNeXt, an advanced convolutional neural network architecture, for multi-class classification of prostate histopathological images into normal, benign, and malignant categories. The dataset, sourced from a tertiary healthcare institution in Nigeria, represents a typically underserved African population, addressing critical disparities in global diagnostic research. We also used the ProstateX dataset (2017) from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) to validate our result. A comprehensive pipeline was developed, leveraging advanced data augmentation, Grad-CAM for interpretability, and an ablation study to enhance model optimization and robustness. The ConvNeXt model achieved an accuracy of 98%, surpassing the performance of traditional CNNs (ResNet50, 93%; EfficientNet, 94%; DenseNet, 92%) and transformer-based models (ViT, 88%; CaiT, 86%; Swin Transformer, 95%; RegNet, 94%). Also, using the ProstateX dataset, the ConvNeXt model recorded 87.2%, 85.7%, 86.4%, and 0.92 as accuracy, recall, F1 score, and AUC, respectively, as validation results. Its hybrid architecture combines the strengths of CNNs and transformers, enabling superior feature extraction. Grad-CAM visualizations further enhance explainability, bridging the gap between computational predictions and clinical trust. Ablation studies demonstrated the contributions of data augmentation, optimizer selection, and learning rate tuning to model performance, highlighting its robustness and adaptability for deployment in low-resource settings. This study advances equitable health care by addressing the lack of regional representation in diagnostic datasets and employing a clinically aligned three-class classification approach. Combining high performance, interpretability, and scalability, this work establishes a foundation for future research on diverse and underrepresented populations, fostering global inclusivity in cancer diagnostics.

AB  - Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is a prevalent cardiac arrhythmia that carries an increased risk of stroke and heart failure. The manual interpretation of Electrocardiograms (ECGs) for diagnosing AF is time-consuming and subject to observer variability. Deep Learning (DL) techniques offer a promising solution for robust AF detection. This paper introduces a novel DL model that leverages ConvMixer and Transformer architecture, combining convolutional neural networks and attention mechanism to extract both local and global features from ECG data. It excels in accurately classifying ECG rhythms into two categories: normal and atrial fibrillation. Additionally, the model utilizes GradCAM++ visualization to provide interpretability. The model was evaluated using the PhysioNet/CinC 2017 Database, achieving accuracies of 91.66% on original data and 96.59% on preprocessed data. When applied to the the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database, it achieved accuracies of 95.86% on original data and 98.78% on preprocessed data, employing a ten-fold cross-validation strategy. This innovative approach has the potential to assist clinicians in the real-time detection of common atrial fibrillation during routine ECG screening, significantly enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of diagnosis. With a strong focus on improving patient outcomes and reducing the burden on healthcare professionals, this research represents a crucial step forward in cardiac arrhythmia detection.

AB  - Personalized federated learning (PFL) is a popular distributed learning framework that allows clients to have different models and has many applications where clients' data are in different domains, including autonomous driving, traffic surveillance, and medical diagnosis. The typical model of a client in PFL features a global encoder trained by all clients to extract universal features from the raw data and personalized layers (e.g., a classifier) trained using the client's local data. Nonetheless, due to the differences between the data distributions of different clients (also known as, domain gaps), the universal features produced by the global encoder largely encompass numerous components irrelevant to a certain client's local task. Some recent PFL methods address the above problem by personalizing specific parameters within the encoder. However, these methods encounter substantial challenges attributed to the high dimensionality and nonlinearity of neural network parameter space. In contrast, the feature space exhibits a lower dimensionality, providing greater intuitiveness and interpretability as compared to the parameter space. To this end, we propose a novel PFL framework named FedPick. FedPick achieves PFL within the low-dimensional feature space by adaptively selecting task-relevant features for each client from the features generated by the global encoder based on its local data distribution. It presents a more accessible and interpretable implementation of PFL compared to those methods working in the parameter space. Extensive experimental results on multiple cross-domain datasets show that FedPick can effectively select task-relevant features for each client and improve model performance in cross-domain FL.

AB  - Background/Objective: This study aims to utilize advanced artificial intelligence (AI) image recog-nition technologies to establish a robust system for identifying features in lung computed tomog-raphy (CT) scans, thereby detecting respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Spe-cifically, the research focuses on developing a new model called Residual-Dense-Attention Gates U-Net (RDAG U-Net) to improve accuracy and efficiency in identification. Methods: This study employed Attention U-Net, Attention Res U-Net, and the newly developed RDAG U-Net model. RDAG U-Net extends the U-Net architecture by incorporating ResBlock and DenseBlock modules in the encoder to retain training parameters and reduce computation time. The training dataset in-cludes 3,520 CT scans from an open database, augmented to 10,560 samples through data en-hancement techniques. The research also focused on optimizing convolutional architectures, image preprocessing, interpolation methods, data management, and extensive fine-tuning of training parameters and neural network modules. Result: The RDAG U-Net model achieved an outstanding accuracy of 93.29% in identifying pulmonary lesions, with a 45% reduction in computation time compared to other models. The study demonstrated that RDAG U-Net performed stably during training and exhibited good generalization capability by evaluating loss values, model-predicted lesion annotations, and validation-epoch curves. Furthermore, using ITK-Snap to convert 2D pre-dictions into 3D lung and lesion segmentation models, the results delineated lesion contours, en-hancing interpretability. Conclusion: The RDAG U-Net model showed significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency in the analysis of CT images for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, achieving a 93.29% recognition accuracy and reducing computation time by 45% compared to other models. These results indicate the potential of the RDAG U-Net model in clinical applications, as it can accelerate the detection of pulmonary lesions and effectively enhance diagnostic accuracy. Additionally, the 2D and 3D visualization results allow physicians to understand lesions' morphology and distribution better, strengthening decision support capabilities and providing valuable medical diagnosis and treatment planning tools.

AB  - Radar sensors, leveraging the Doppler effect, enable the nonintrusive capture of kinetic and physiological motions while preserving privacy. Deep learning (DL) facilitates radar sensing for healthcare applications such as gait recognition and vital-sign measurement. However, band-dependent patterns, indicating variations in patterns and power scales associated with frequencies in time-frequency representation (TFR), challenge radar sensing applications using DL. Frequency-dependent characteristics and features with lower power scales may be overlooked during representation learning. This paper proposes an Enhanced Band-Dependent Learning framework (E-BDL) comprising an adaptive sub-band filtering module, a representation learning module, and a sub-view contrastive module to fully detect band-dependent features in sub-frequency bands and leverage them for classification. Experimental validation is conducted on two radar datasets, including gait abnormality recognition for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related dementia (ADRD) risk evaluation and vital-sign monitoring for hemodynamics scenario classification. For hemodynamics scenario classification, E-BDL-ResNet achieves competitive performance in overall accuracy and class-wise evaluations compared to recent methods.

AB  - Recently, there has been considerable growth in the internet of things (IoT)-based healthcare applications; however, they suffer from a lack of intrusion detection systems (IDS). Leveraging recent technologies, such as machine learning (ML), edge computing, and blockchain, can provide suitable and strong security solutions for preserving the privacy of medical data. In this paper, FIDChain IDS is proposed using lightweight artificial neural networks (ANN) in a federated learning (FL) way to ensure healthcare data privacy preservation with the advances of blockchain technology that provides a distributed ledger for aggregating the local weights and then broadcasting the updated global weights after averaging, which prevents poisoning attacks and provides full transparency and immutability over the distributed system with negligible overhead. Applying the detection model at the edge protects the cloud if an attack happens, as it blocks the data from its gateway with smaller detection time and lesser computing and processing capacity as FL deals with smaller sets of data. The ANN and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) models were evaluated using the BoT-IoT dataset. The results show that ANN models have higher accuracy and better performance with the heterogeneity of data in IoT devices, such as intensive care unit (ICU) in healthcare systems. Testing the FIDChain with different datasets (CSE-CIC-IDS2018, Bot Net IoT, and KDD Cup 99) reveals that the BoT-IoT dataset has the most stable and accurate results for testing IoT applications, such as those used in healthcare systems.

AB  - This study introduces a system for predicting disease progression events in multiple myeloma patients from the CoMMpass study (N = 1186). Utilizing a hybrid neural network architecture, our model predicts future blood work from historical lab results with high accuracy, significantly outperforming baseline estimators for key disease parameters. Disease progression events are annotated in the forecasted data, predicting these events with significant reliability. We externally validated our model using the GMMG-MM5 study dataset (N = 504), and could reproduce the main results of our study. Our approach enables early detection and personalized monitoring of patients at risk of impeding progression. Designed modularly, our system enhances interpretability, facilitates integration of additional modules, and uses routine blood work measurements to ensure accessibility in clinical settings. With this, we contribute to the development of a scalable, cost-effective virtual human twin system for optimized healthcare resource utilization and improved outcomes in multiple myeloma patient care.

AB  - Background Medivision is a modern diagnostic system that has been developed to improve colorectal cancer detection. Methodology By applying deep learning acquisitions, including convolutional neural networks, Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix feature extraction, and visualization with Grad-CAM. After developing the Medivision system, several colonoscopy image datasets were used for evaluating a number of state-of-the-art deep CNN architectures, such as ResNet50, VGG16, VGG19, and DenseNet201-namely, CVC Clinic DB, Kvasir2, and Hyper Kvasir, however, through exhaustive model comparisons with integrated CNNs DEV-22 and RV-22. By the incorporation of GLCM feature extraction, textual analysis has become enhanced in the capturing of some critical features within an image that enhances model sensitivity in the detection of subtle variation within colorectal polyps. Grad-CAM visualizations enhance interpretability by enabling clinicians to attribute diagnostically important regions and insight into the model's process of decision-making, incorporated with cloud storage. Results This work confirmed the stability and reliability of VGG16 in different conditions of image shooting. Among these, the best performances for all datasets were obtained by the model VGG16, confirming its consistency and robustness in varying conditions of image acquisition. On the CVC Clinic DB, VGG16 assured a training accuracy of 99.22% and a testing accuracy of 96.12%. The model, when trained on the Kvasir2 dataset, achieved an accuracy of 96.56% during training and 94.25% when testing, while on the Hyper Kvasir dataset, the model supported training accuracy of 95.19% and a testing accuracy of 98.87%. Apart from that, VGG16 also showed a good localization capability for the average IoU of 0.78 on CVC Clinic DB, 0.79 on Kvasir2, and 0.77 on Hyper Kvasir, indicating its precision in identifying polyp regions. It also tested the performance of integrated CNN models DEV-22 and RV-22 in complex multi-dataset scenarios. DEV-22 gave the best-performing integrated model against test accuracies of 97.86% against CVC Clinic DB, 89.37% against Kvasir2, and 76.08% against Hyper Kvasir, while RV-22 resulted in relatively poor performance across these datasets.This indicates that DEV-22 might be much better suited for colorectal cancer detection tasks whenever multiple datasets are concerned. The high testing accuracy and precise localization capabilities of VGG16 and DEV-22 show their robustness within the Medivision system for delivering appropriate clinically relevant returns on colorectal cancer screening across all three datasets. Clinical relevance Medivision enables real-time analysis in an accessible and efficient way for healthcare providers. This paper presents the clinical relevance of this system in enhancing diagnostic accuracy and interpretation for colorectal cancer screening workflows. Conclusion It represents a state-of-the-art integration of high-performance deep CNN models, GLCM, and Grad-CAM for accurate, interpretable, and actionable outcomes in the diagnosis of colorectal cancer, by representing one great bound in AI-mediated medical diagnosis.

AB  - Predicting drug response in cancer cell lines is a vital field in precision medicine, supporting personalized treatment planning, optimizing drug selection, and enhancing the accuracy and effectiveness of cancer therapies. Although graph neural network-based models for drug response prediction have made significant progress in performance, they often focus solely on learning node embeddings while overlooking adjacency relationships between cell lines, limiting the model's ability to capture inter-cell line adjacency information. To address this limitation, we propose a novel model that constructs edge features by measuring similarity between cell lines and their k-nearest neighbors, integrating these edge features with a node-edge complementary attention mechanism. This approach enables the model to dynamically incorporate node and edge information, achieving complementary and collaborative feature learning. Such a design substantially improves the accuracy and biological interpretability of drug response prediction. Furthermore, to enhance the independence and complementarity of node and edge features, we introduce a complementary loss mechanism in the model and design a topology updating module that performs dynamic feature updates via neighborhood aggregation, effectively capturing and utilizing multi-omics data. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, which contains various diseases such as esophageal carcinoma, stomach adenocarcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma and rectal adenocarcinoma, the results demonstrate that our model outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in cancer drug response prediction.

AB  - Objective: Survival analysis is widely utilized in healthcare to predict the timing of disease onset. Traditional methods of survival analysis are usually based on Cox Proportional Hazards model and assume proportional risk for all subjects. However, this assumption is rarely true for most diseases, as the underlying factors have complex, non-linear, and time-varying relationships. This concern is especially relevant for pregnancy, where the risk for pregnancy-related complications, such as preeclampsia, varies across gestation. Recently, deep learning survival models have shown promise in addressing the limitations of classical models, as the novel models allow for nonproportional risk handling, capturing nonlinear relationships, and navigating complex temporal dynamics. Methods: We present a methodology to model the temporal risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy and investigate the associated clinical risk factors. We utilized a retrospective dataset including 66,425 pregnant individuals who delivered in two tertiary care centers from 2015 to 2023. We modeled the preeclampsia risk by modifying DeepHit, a deep survival model, which leverages neural network architecture to capture time-varying relationships between covariates in pregnancy. We applied time series k-means clustering to DeepHit's normalized output and investigated interpretability using Shapley values. Results: We demonstrate that DeepHit can effectively handle high-dimensional data and evolving risk hazards over time with performance similar to the Cox Proportional Hazards model, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.78 for both models. The deep survival model outperformed traditional methodology by identifying time-varied risk trajectories for preeclampsia, providing insights for early and individualized intervention. Kmeans clustering resulted in patients delineating into low-risk, early-onset, and late-onset preeclampsia groups-notably, each of those has distinct risk factors. Conclusion: This work demonstrates a novel application of deep survival analysis in time-varying prediction of preeclampsia risk. Our results highlight the advantage of deep survival models compared to Cox Proportional Hazards models in providing personalized risk trajectory and demonstrating the potential of deep survival models to generate interpretable and meaningful clinical applications in medicine.

AB  - Explainability is crucial in domains where system decisions have significant implications for human trust in black -box models. Lack of understanding regarding how these decisions are made hinders the adoption of so-called clinical decision support systems. While neural networks and deep learning methods exhibit impressive performance, they remain less explainable than whitebox approaches. Artificial Hydrocarbon Networks (AHN) is an effective black -box model that can be used to support critical clinical decisions if accompanied by explainability mechanisms to instill confidence among clinicians. In this paper, we present a use case involving global and local explanations for AHN models, provided with an automatic procedure so-called eXplainable Artificial Hydrocarbon Networks (XAHN). We apply XAHN to preeclampsia prognosis, enabling interpretability within an accurate black -box model. Our approach involves training a suitable AHN model using the cross -validation with ten repetitions, followed by a comparative analysis against four well-known machine learning techniques. Notably, the AHN model outperformed the others, achieving an F1 -score of 74.91%. Additionally, we assess the efficacy of our XAHN explainer through a survey applied to clinicians, evaluating the goodness and satisfaction of the provided explanations. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents one of the earliest attempts to address the explainability challenge in preeclampsia prediction.

AB  - In the intelligent medical diagnosis area, Artificial Intelligence (AI)'s trustworthiness, reliability, and interpretability are critical, especially in cancer diagnosis. Traditional neural networks, while excellent at processing natural images, often lack interpretability and adaptability when processing high-resolution digital pathological images. This limitation is particularly evident in pathological diagnosis, which is the gold standard of cancer diagnosis and relies on a pathologist's careful examination and analysis of digital pathological slides to identify the features and progression of the disease. Therefore, the integration of interpretable AI into smart medical diagnosis is not only an inevitable technological trend but also a key to improving diagnostic accuracy and reliability. In this paper, we introduce an innovative Multi-Scale Multi-Branch Feature Encoder (MSBE) and present the design of the CrossLinkNet Framework. The MSBE enhances the network's capability for feature extraction by allowing the adjustment of hyperparameters to configure the number of branches and modules. The CrossLinkNet Framework, serving as a versatile image segmentation network architecture, employs cross-layer encoder-decoder connections for multi-level feature fusion, thereby enhancing feature integration and segmentation accuracy. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on two datasets demonstrate that CrossLinkNet, equipped with the MSBE encoder, not only achieves accurate segmentation results but is also adaptable to various tumor segmentation tasks and scenarios by replacing different feature encoders. Crucially, CrossLinkNet emphasizes the interpretability of the AI model, a crucial aspect for medical professionals, providing an in-depth understanding of the model's decisions and thereby enhancing trust and reliability in AI-assisted diagnostics.

AB  - Deep neural networks have made remarkable contributions in many fields such as computer vision and natural language processing. However, due to their complex internal structures, for a long time, there is a lack of trust in deep neural networks, particularly in the domains like healthcare, finance, traffic safety, etc. To explain the internal mechanism of deep neural networks, a series of interpretable models, which mainly focus on enhancing the interpretability of deep learning models, has been proposed. This study pursues to data interpretability by analyzing the significance of image features with the goal of mining essential information contained in various visual features. Super-pixel segmentation is firstly applied to divide the image into several coherent visual feature regions, and these regions are subsequently overwritten by certain marks. Next, image occlusion is realized by modifying the pixel values of these feature regions according to the marks. Finally, we conduct comparative analytics of the classification results between the original data and occluded data to scrutinize the importance of key visual features. A collection of experimental studies is conducted and the results consistently demonstrate that the proposed method enables to observe the classifier's dependence on different features, offering a new perspective on interpretability rooted in data analytics.

AB  - The rising popularity of tabular data in data science applications has led to a surge of interest in utilizing deep neural networks (DNNs) to address tabular problems. Existing deep neural network methods are not effective in handling two fundamental challenges that are inherent in tabular data: permutation invariance (where the labels remain unchanged regardless of element order) and local dependency (where predictive labels are solely determined by local features). Furthermore, given the inherent heterogeneity among elements in tabular data, effectively capturing heterogeneous feature interactions remains unresolved. In this paper, we propose a novel Multiplex Cross-Feature Interaction Network (MPCFIN) by explicitly and systematically modeling feature relations with interactive graph neural networks. Specifically, MPCFIN first learns the most relevant features associated with individual features, and merges them to form cross-feature embedding. Subsequently, we design a multiplex graph neural network to learn enhanced representation for each sample. Comprehensive experiments on seven datasets demonstrate that MPCFIN exhibits superior performance over deep neural network methods in modeling the tabular data, showcasing consistent interpretability in its cross-feature embedding module for medical diagnosis applications.

AB  - Learning individualized treatment rules (ITRs) for a target patient population with mental disorders is confronted with many challenges. First, the target population may be different from the training population that provided data for learning ITRs. Ignoring differences between the training patient data and the target population can result in sub-optimal treatment strategies for the target population. Second, for mental disorders, a patient's underlying mental state is not observed but can be inferred from measures of high-dimensional combinations of symptomatology. Treatment mechanisms are unknown and can be complex, and thus treatment effect moderation can take complicated forms. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method that connects measurement models, efficient weighting schemes, and flexible neural network architecture through latent variables to tailor treatments for a target population. Patients' underlying mental states are represented by a compact set of latent state variables while preserving interpretability. Weighting schemes are designed based on lower-dimensional latent variables to efficiently balance population differences so that biases in learning the latent structure and treatment effects are mitigated. Extensive simulation studies demonstrated consistent superiority of the proposed method and the weighting approach. Applications to two real-world studies of patients with major depressive disorder have shown a broad utility of the proposed method in improving treatment outcomes in the target population.

AB  - One of the goals of precision psychiatry is to characterize mental disorders in an individualized manner, taking into account the underlying dynamic processes. Recent advances in mobile technologies have enabled the collection of ecological momentary assessments that capture multiple responses in real-time at high frequency. However, ecological momentary assessment data are often multi-dimensional, correlated, and hierarchical. Mixed-effect models are commonly used but may require restrictive assumptions about the fixed and random effects and the correlation structure. The recurrent temporal restricted Boltzmann machine (RTRBM) is a generative neural network that can be used to model temporal data, but most existing RTRBM approaches do not account for the potential heterogeneity of group dynamics within a population based on available covariates. In this paper, we propose a new temporal generative model, the HDRBM, to learn the heterogeneous group dynamics and demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on simulated and real-world ecological momentary assessment datasets. We show that by incorporating covariates, HDRBM can improve accuracy and interpretability, explore the underlying drivers of the group dynamics of participants, and serve as a generative model for ecological momentary assessment studies.

AB  - Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable sensor data is increasingly important in healthcare, rehabilitation, and smart monitoring. This study systematically compared three dynamic neural network architectures-Finite Impulse Response Neural Network (FIRNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-to examine their suitability and specificity for HAR tasks. A controlled experimental setup was applied, training 16,500 models across different delay lengths and hidden neuron counts. The investigation focused on classification accuracy, computational cost, and model interpretability. LSTM achieved the highest classification accuracy (98.76%), followed by GRU (97.33%) and FIRNN (95.74%), with FIRNN offering the lowest computational complexity. To improve model transparency, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) was applied to both input and hidden layers. The results showed that gyroscope Y-axis data was consistently the most informative, while accelerometer Y-axis data was the least informative. LRP analysis also revealed that GRU distributed relevance more broadly across hidden units, while FIRNN relied more on a small subset. These findings highlight trade-offs between performance, complexity, and interpretability and provide practical guidance for applying explainable neural wearable sensor-based HAR.

AB  - Many mathematical models suffer from model discrepancy, posing a significant challenge to their use in clinical decision-making. In this article, we consider methods for addressing this issue. In the first approach, a mathematical model is treated as a black box system, and model discrepancy is defined as an independent and additive term that accounts for the difference between the physical phenomena and the model representation. A Gaussian Process (GP) is commonly used to capture the model discrepancy. An alternative approach is to construct a hybrid grey box model by filling in the incomplete parts of the mathematical model with a neural network. The neural network is used to learn the missing processes by comparing the observations with the model output. To enhance interpretability, the outputs of this non-parametric model can then be regressed into a symbolic form to obtain the learned model. We compare and discuss the effectiveness of these approaches in handling model discrepancy using clinical data from the ICU and the Siggaard-Andersen oxygen status algorithm.This article is part of the theme issue 'Uncertainty quantification for healthcare and biological systems (Part 2)'.

AB  - BackgroundThe recent development of high-throughput sequencing techniques provide massive data that can be used in genome-wide prediction (GWP). Although GWP is effective on its own, the incorporation of traditional polygenic pedigree information into GWP has been shown to further improve prediction accuracy. However, most of the methods developed in this field require that individuals with genomic information can be connected to the polygenic pedigree within a standard linear mixed model framework that involves calculation of computationally demanding matrix inverses of the combined pedigrees. The extension of this integrated approach to more flexible machine learning methods has been slow.MethodsThis study aims to enhance genomic prediction by implementing gated residual variable selection neural networks (GRVSNN) for multi-task genomic prediction. By integrating low-rank information from pedigree-based relationship matrices with genomic markers, we seek to improve predictive accuracy and interpretability compared to conventional regression and deep learning (DL) models. The prediction properties of the GRVSNN model are evaluated on several real-world datasets, including loblolly pine, mouse and pig.ResultsThe experimental results demonstrate that the GRVSNN model outperforms traditional tabular genomic prediction models, including Bayesian regression methods and LassoNet. Using genomic and pedigree information, GRVSNN achieves a lower mean squared error (MSE), and higher Pearson (r) and distance (dCor) correlation between predicted and true phenotypic values in the test data. Moreover, GRVSNN selects fewer genetic markers and pedigree loadings which improves interpretability.ConclusionThe suggested GRVSNN framework provides a novel and computationally effective approach to improve genomic prediction accuracy by integrating information from traditional pedigrees with genomic data. The model's ability to conduct multi-task predictions underscores its potential to enhance selection processes in agricultural species and predict multiple diseases in precision medicine.

AB  - The "opaque system" phenomenon inherent in deep neural networks poses significant challenges to the reliability and trustworthiness of their decision-making processes, particularly in high-stakes applications such as medical diagnosis and financial security. Current deep neural network models primarily use gradients or intermediate features to improve decision reliability, but most of the explanatory methods rooted in these features are post-hoc, with little direct influence on the classifiers' decision outcomes. In contrast to human object recognition, where decisions and the underlying visual logic are clarified by both positive and negative causal evidence, deep neural networks often fail to achieve this level of nuanced understanding. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce a novel deep model based on Causal Interaction Attention (CIA), which aims to improve the reliability and interpretability of visual classification. Specifically, we first propose an interactive attention-driven decision mechanism that dynamically integrates visual features into the decision process, ensuring that each classifier output is accompanied by corresponding positive or negative visual interpretations. This mechanism not only explains "why this image belongs to a certain category", but also rationalizes "why this image does not belong to other categories", providing a comprehensive view of the model's decision. In addition, to dynamically adapt to changes in the learning scenarios, we designed a loss function to adaptively control the strength of attention. It enhances the model to dynamically identify the most relevant visual cues, tailored to the granularity of the visual cues. The final experimental results show that the CIA can provide better visual interpretation while maintaining accuracy and reliability on small and medium-sized datasets.

AB  - Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures. Accurate diagnosis and effective monitoring require the precise classification of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. In this study, we introduce a novel approach that combines Adaptive Local Iterative Filtering (ALIF) for signal decomposition with an attention-enhanced cascaded deep neural network (CDNN) architecture. The ALIF algorithm decomposes EEG signals into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) that capture inherent oscillatory components. These IMFs are processed by the CDNN, which operates in two stages: a feature extraction module and a classification module. In the feature extraction stage, a SEblock channel attention mechanism dynamically prioritizes significant features within the IMFs. The classification stage employs a hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture that effectively captures both spatial and temporal dependencies. To enhance interpretability, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) framework is incorporated to provide insights into the model's decision-making process, while Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) visualizes the most discriminative regions in the input data. Rigorously validated using 10-fold cross-validation on the Bonn and EEG Epilepsy databases, the proposed methodology achieved an exceptional classification accuracy of 100%, with sensitivity, specificity, and F1-scores exceeding 99% across various scenarios. The integration of SHAP and Grad-CAM not only elucidates the model's decision processes but also contributes to a more interpretable and reliable system for epileptic EEG signal classification. This synergistic combination of advanced signal processing, deep learning, and interpretability techniques holds significant potential to enhance epilepsy diagnosis and strengthen trust in clinical decision support systems.

AB  - Glioblastoma is among the most aggressive brain tumors in adults, characterized by patient-specific invasion patterns driven by the underlying brain microstructure. In this work, we present a proof-of-concept for a mathematical model of GBL growth, enabling real-time prediction and patient-specific parameter identification from longitudinal neuroimaging data. The framework exploits a diffuse-interface mathematical model to describe the tumor evolution and a reduced-order modeling strategy, relying on proper orthogonal decomposition, trained on synthetic data derived from patient-specific brain anatomies reconstructed from magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging. A neural network surrogate learns the inverse mapping from tumor evolution to model parameters, achieving significant computational speed-up while preserving high accuracy. To ensure robustness and interpretability, we perform both global and local sensitivity analyses, identifying the key biophysical parameters governing tumor dynamics and assessing the stability of the inverse problem solution. These results establish a methodological foundation for future clinical deployment of patient-specific digital twins in neuro-oncology.

AB  - Electroencephalogram-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) hold promise for healthcare applications but are hindered by cross-subject variability and limited data. This article proposes a multi-task (MT) classification model, AM-MTEEG, which integrates deep learning-based convolutional and impulsive networks with bidirectional associative memory (AM) for cross-subject EEG classification. AM-MTEEG deals with the EEG classification of each subject as an independent task and utilizes common features across subjects. The model is built with a convolutional encoder-decoder and a population of impulsive neurons to extract shared features across subjects, as well as a Hebbian-learned bidirectional associative memory matrix to classify EEG within one subject. Experimental results on two BCI competition datasets demonstrate that AM-MTEEG improves average accuracy over state-of-the-art methods and reduces performance variance across subjects. Visualization of neuronal impulses in the bidirectional associative memory network reveal a precise mapping between hidden-layer neuron activities and specific movements. Given four motor imagery categories, the reconstructed waveforms resemble the real event-related potentials, highlighting the biological interpretability of the model beyond classification.

AB  - In medical diagnostics, the use of interpretable artificial neural networks (ANN) is crucial to enabling healthcare professionals to make informed decisions that consider risks, especially when faced with uncertainties in patient data and expert opinions. Despite advances, conventional ANNs often produce complex, not transparent models that limit interpretability, particularly in medical contexts where transparency is essential. Existing methods, such as decision trees and random forests, provide some interpretability but struggle with inconsistent medical data and fail to adequately quantify decision uncertainty. This paper introduces a novel Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH)-type neural network approach that addresses these gaps by generating concise, interpretable decision models based on the self-organizing concept. The proposed method builds multilayer networks using two-argument logical functions, ensuring explainability and minimizing the negative impact of human intervention. The method employs a selection criterion to incrementally grow networks, optimizing complexity while reducing validation errors. The algorithm's convergence is proven through a bounded, monotonically decreasing error sequence, ensuring reliable solutions. Having been tested in complex diagnostic cases, including infectious endocarditis, systemic red lupus, and postoperative outcomes in acute appendicitis, the method achieved high expert agreement scores (Fleiss's kappa of 0.98 (95% CI 0.97-0.99) and 0.86 (95% CI 0.83-0.89), respectively) compared to random forests (0.84 and 0.71). These results demonstrate statistically significant improvements (p < 0.05), highlighting the method's ability to produce interpretable rules that reflect uncertainties and improve the reliability of decisions. Having demonstrated a transparent and robust framework for medical decision-making, the proposed approach bridges the gap between model accuracy and interpretability, providing practitioners with reliable insights and confidence estimates required for making risk-aware decisions.

AB  - Decalcification is crucial in enhancing the diagnostic accuracy and interpretability of cardiac CT images, particularly in cardiovascular imaging. Calcification in the coronary arteries and cardiac structures can significantly impact the quality of the images and hinder precise diagnostics. This study introduces a novel approach, Hybrid Models for Decalcify Cardiac CT (HMDC), aimed at enhancing the clarity of cardiac CT images through effective decalcification. Decalcification is critical in medical imaging, especially in cardiac CT scans, where calcification can hinder accurate diagnostics. The proposed HMDC leverages advanced deep-learning techniques and traditional image-processing methods for efficient and robust decalcification. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of HMDC, achieving an outstanding accuracy of 97.22%, surpassing existing decalcification methods. The hybrid nature of the model harnesses the strengths of both deep learning and traditional approaches, leading to more transparent and more diagnostically valuable cardiac CT images. The study underscores the potential impact of HMDC in improving the precision and reliability of cardiac CT diagnostics, contributing to advancements in cardiovascular healthcare. This research introduces a cutting-edge solution for decalcifying cardiac CT images and sets the stage for further exploration and refinement of hybrid models in medical imaging applications. The implications of HMDC extend beyond decalcification, opening avenues for innovation and improvement in cardiac imaging modalities, ultimately benefiting patient care and diagnostic accuracy.

AB  - Background: Image segmentation is crucial in medical diagnosis, helping to identify diseased areas in images for more accurate diagnoses. The U-Net model, a convolutional neural network (CNN) widely used for medical image segmentation, has limitations in extracting global features and handling multi-scale pathological information. This study aims to address these challenges by proposing a novel model that enhances segmentation performance while reducing computational demands. Methods: We introduce the LUNeXt model, which integrates Vision Transformers (ViT) with a redesigned convolution block structure. This model employs depthwise separable convolutions to capture global features with fewer parameters. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on four diverse medical image datasets to evaluate the model's performance. Results: The LUNeXt model demonstrated competitive segmentation performance with a significant reduction in parameters and floating-point operations (FLOPs) compared to traditional U-Net models. The application of explainable AI techniques provided clear visualization of segmentation results, highlighting the model's efficacy in efficient medical image segmentation. Conclusions: LUNeXt facilitates efficient medical image segmentation on standard hardware, reducing the learning curve and making advanced techniques more accessible to practitioners. This model balances the complexity and parameter count, offering a promising solution for enhancing the accuracy of pathological feature extraction in medical images.

AB  - Chronic pain leads to not only physical discomfort but also psychological challenges, such as depression and anxiety, which contribute to a substantial healthcare burden. Pain detection and assessment remains a challenge due to its subjective nature. Current clinical methods may be inaccurate or unfeasible for non-verbal patients. Consequently, Electroencephalography (EEG) has emerged as a promising non-invasive tool for pain detection. However, EEG-based pain detection faces challenges such as noise, volume conduction effects, and high inter-subject variability. Deep learning (DL) models have shown potential in overcoming these challenges by extracting nonlinear and discriminative patterns. Despite advancements, these models often require a subject-dependent approach and lack of interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a threefold DL-based framework for coding EEG-based pain detection patterns. (i) We employ the Kernel Cross-Spectral Gaussian Functional Connectivity Network (KCS-FCnet) to code pairwise channel dependencies for pain detection. (ii) Furthermore, we introduce a frequency-based strategy for class activation mapping to visualize pertinent pain EEG features, thereby enhancing visual interpretability through spatio-frequency patterns. (iii) Further, to account for subject variability, we conduct cross-subject analysis and grouping, clustering individuals based on similar pain detection performance, functional connectivity patterns, sex, and age. We evaluate our model using the Brain Mediators of Pain dataset and demonstrate its robustness through subject-dependent and cross-subject generalization tasks for pain detection on non-verbal patients.

AB  - Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurological condition that deteriorates memory, cognition, and behavior, especially in older adults. Timely identification is essential to enhance patient outcomes and inform therapy choices. This research introduces an extensive deep learning model for multiclass Alzheimer's disease stage classification using structural MRI images from the publicly accessible OASIS dataset. The procedure begins with thorough preprocessing, including skull stripping, axial slice extraction, and intensity normalization to guarantee uniform input quality. Deep Convolution Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) is used to produce authentic synthetic MRI slices, therefore addressing data imbalance and enhancing class representation and training stability. The EffSwin-XNet model introduces a novel hybrid deep learning framework that strategically fuses EfficientNet-B0 and the Swin Transformer, enabling both local and global feature extraction from MRI brain images. This represents a significant advancement over conventional convolutional neural networks and a feature fusion attention mechanism that adaptively emphasizes discriminative features. Grad-CAM is used for explainability to view the brain areas influencing each categorization judgment, hence increasing therapeutic confidence. The model attains a classification accuracy of 95.3%, surpassing traditional CNN and hybrid benchmarks. This study presents an enhanced, interpretable, and efficient method for stage-wise categorization of Alzheimer's Disease, demonstrating significant potential for use in clinical decision-support systems for early classification and intervention.

AB  - This paper introduces a medical recommendation system that utilizes vertical Federated Learning (FL) to securely access real-time patient and healthcare data to provide personalized treatment recommendations. It utilizes insights from federated servers through sentiment and emotion analysis. The incorporation of blockchain technology into FL addresses concerns related to ownership and privacy by utilizing neural synchronization and hyperledger fabric to safeguard data. Data providers encrypt instances to improve dependability and store them on the blockchain using structured transactions. This solution combines these technologies with professional medical knowledge to cooperatively train Machine Learning (ML) models on dispersed healthcare data. Implementing a knowledge-based recommendation system improves the accuracy and interpretability of disease prediction models. Healthcare professionals can use various patient data while protecting privacy and using collective medical expertise. It builds a blockchain key using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) that are aligned neurally in opposite directions. This assures the confidentiality, transparency, and traceability of medical information. The system uses Bagging, Gradient Boost, Light-GBM, N-Gram, Random Forest, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Federated Deep Learning to improve disease prediction while maintaining raw data privacy through collaborative learning. Evaluation metrics show increased privacy, security, and personalized medical advice, with a focus on safe storage, tailored treatment plans, individualized therapy recommendations, blockchain-based Electronic Health Record (EHR) storage, and performance monitoring. Hyperledger fabric tracks EHR changes on a cloud platform. A comprehensive assessment reveals that this technique has the potential for success in real-world healthcare.

AB  - Anomaly detection in multivariate time series (MTS) is crucial in domains such as industrial monitoring, cybersecurity, healthcare, and autonomous driving. Deep learning approaches have improved anomaly detection but lack interpretability. We propose an explainable anomaly detection (XAD) framework using a sparse non-linear vector autoregressive network (SNL-VAR-Net). This framework combines neural networks with vector autoregression for non-linear representation learning and interpretable models. We employ regularization to enforce sparsity, enabling efficient handling of long-range dependencies. Additionally, augmented Lagrange multiplier-based techniques for low-rank and sparse decomposition reduce the impact of noise. Evaluation on publicly available datasets shows that SNL-VAR-Net offers comparable performance to deep learning methods with better interpretability.

AB  - This study aimed to develop and evaluate deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) models with Grad-CAM visualization for the automated classification with interpretability of tongue conditions-specifically glossitis and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC)-using clinical tongue photographs, with a focus on their potential for early detection and telemedicine-based diagnostics. A total of 652 tongue images were categorized into normal control (n = 294), glossitis (n = 340), and OSCC (n = 17). Four pretrained DCNN architectures (VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, ResNet152) were fine-tuned using transfer learning. Model interpretability was enhanced via Grad-CAM and sparsity analysis. Diagnostic performance was assessed using AUROC, with subgroup analysis by age, sex, and image segmentation strategy. For glossitis classification, VGG16 (AUROC = 0.8428, 95% CI 0.7757-0.9100) and VGG19 (AUROC = 0.8639, 95% CI 0.7988-0.9170) performed strongly, while the ensemble of VGG16 and VGG19 achieved the best result (AUROC = 0.8731, 95% CI 0.8072-0.9298). OSCC detection showed near-perfect performance across all models, with VGG19 and ResNet152 achieving AUROC = 1.0000 and VGG16 reaching AUROC = 0.9902 (95% CI 0.9707-1.0000). Diagnostic performance did not differ significantly by age (P = 0.3052) or sex (P = 0.4531), and whole-image classification outperformed patch-wise segmentation (P = 0.7440). DCNN models with Grad-CAM demonstrated robust performance in classifying glossitis and OSCC from tongue photographs with interpretability. The results highlight the potential of AI-driven tongue diagnosis as a valuable tool for remote healthcare, promoting early detection and expanding access to oral health services.

AB  - PurposeAccurate differentiation of Parkinsonism subtypes-including Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple system atrophy (MSA), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)-is essential for clinical prognosis and treatment planning. However, this remains a major challenge due to overlapping symptomatology and high inter-individual variability in cerebral glucose metabolism patterns observed on fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET).MethodsTo address these challenges, we propose PETFormer-SCL, a clinically informed deep learning framework that integrates convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a channel-wise Transformer module, guided by supervised contrastive learning (SCL). This architecture is designed to enhance disease-specific feature learning while mitigating individual variability.ResultsTrained on 945 patients and evaluated on an independent test cohort of 330 patients (1275 in total), PETFormer-SCL achieved AUCs of 0.9830, 0.9702, and 0.9565 for MSA, PD, and PSP, respectively. In addition, class activation maps (CAMs) highlighted key disease-related brain regions-including the cerebellum, midbrain, and basal ganglia-demonstrating strong alignment with known pathophysiological findings.ConclusionsPETFormer-SCL not only achieves high diagnostic accuracy, particularly for subtypes with overlapping phenotypes, but also enhances interpretability. These results support its potential as a reliable clinical decision-support tool for the early and differential diagnosis of Parkinsonism.

AB  - An ontology-driven system for the diagnosis of heart disease combines data-driven methods with semantic reasoning. The dataset consists of major healthcare attributes like patient information, clinical findings, and diagnostic indicators. This information is processed in a methodical way into a clinical ontology, which facilitates structured, semantically enhanced representation of medical entities and their relationships. The system uses a hybrid strategy based on decision trees and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to enhance predictive performance. Decision trees offer interpretability through the identification of key decision paths, whereas GNNs utilize connected clinical ontology for richer relational analysis. Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules also enrich reasoning by deducing new knowledge from implicit relationships and patterns. The rules combine risk factors such as hypertension, cholesterol, and lifestyle to predict heart disease with high accuracy. The integration of rule-based reasoning and machine learning provides a complete and context-sensitive system. Performance is measured using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC) to provide solid diagnostic evaluation. The hybrid model of decision trees, GNNs, and ontology-based reasoning with boosting via Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules shows great predictive accuracy and decision support improvements. The clinical ontology provides interpretability, flexibility, and scalability for future data sets and changing medical knowledge. This work emphasizes the opportunity of combining ontology engineering, machine learning, and semantic reasoning in enhancing heart disease prediction and diagnosis. The system assists healthcare workers in making well-informed decisions, improving diagnosis accuracy, and maximizing patient management.

AB  - Skin cancer is among the most prevalent types of malignancy all over the global and is strongly associated with the patient's prognosis and the accuracy of the initial diagnosis. Clinical examination of skin lesions is a key aspect that is important in the assessment of skin disease but comes with some drawbacks mainly with interpretational aspects, time-consuming and healthare expenditure. Skin cancer if detected early and treated in time can be controlled and its deadly impacts arrested completely. Algorithms applied in convolutional neural network (CNN) could lead to an enhanced speed of identifying and distinguishing a disease, which in turn leads to early detection and treatment. So as to eliminate these challenges, optimized CNN prediction models for cancer skin classification is studied in this researche. The objectives of this study were to develop reliable optimized CNN prediction models for skin cancer classification, to handle the severe class imbalance problem where skin cancer class was found to be much smaller than the healthy class. To evaluate model interpretability and to develop an end-to-end smart healthcare system using explainable AI (XAI) such as Grad-CAM and Grad-CAM++. In this researche new activation function namely NGNDG-AF was offered specifically to enhance the capabilities of network fitting and generalization ability, convergence rate and reduction in mathematical computational cost. A research used an optimized CNN and ResNet152V2 with the HAM10000 dataset to differentiate between the seven forms of skin cancer. Model training involved the use of two optimization functions (RMSprop and Adam) and NGNDG-AF activation functions. Cross validation technique the holdout validation is used to estimate of the model's generalization performance for unseed data. Optimized CNN is performing well as compare to ResNet152V2 for unseen data. The efficacy of the optimized CNN method with NGNDG-AF was examined by a comparative study wirh popular CNN with various activation functions shows that better performance of NGNDG-AF, achieving the classification accuracy rates that are as high as 99% in training and 98% in the validation. The recommended system also involves the integration of the smart healthcare application as a central component to give the doctors as well as the healthcare providers diagnosing and tools that would assist in the early detection of skin cancer hence leading to better outcomes of the treatment.

AB  - Background Nosocomial infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the ICU. Earlier identification of these complications may facilitate better clinical management and improve outcomes. We developed a dynamic prediction model that leveraged high-frequency longitudinal data to estimate infection risk 48 h ahead of clinically overt deterioration. Methods We used electronic health record data from consecutive adults who had been treated for > 48 h in a mixed tertiary ICU in the Netherlands enrolled in the Molecular Diagnosis and Risk Stratification of Sepsis (MARS) cohort from 2011 to 2018. All infectious episodes were prospectively adjudicated. ICU-acquired infection (ICU-AI) risk was estimated using a Cox landmark model with high-resolution vital sign data processed via a convolutional neural network (CNN). Results We studied 32,178 observation days in 4444 patients and observed 1197 infections, yielding an overall infection risk of 3.5% per ICU day. Discrimination of the composite model was moderate with c-index values varying between 0.64 (95%CI: 0.58-0.69) and 0.72 (95%CI: 0.66-0.78) across timepoints, with some overestimation of ICU-AI risk overall (mean calibration slope 0.58). Compared to 38 common features of infection, a CNN risk score derived from five vital sign signals consistently ranked as a strong predictor of ICU-AI across all time points but did not substantially change risk prediction of ICU-AI. Conclusion A dynamic modelling approach that incorporates machine learning of high-frequency vital sign data shows promise as a continuous bedside index of infection risk. Further validation is needed to weigh added complexity and interpretability of the deep learning model against potential benefits for clinical decision support in the ICU.

AB  - Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) presents a significant challenge, necessitating ongoing research and preventive measures. The intricate landscape of lipid metabolism plays a crucial role in SIDS, with disruptions in key lipid components like Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFA), alongside other lipids such as triglycerides (TG) and phospholipids (PL), being significant. In this context, SCFA are essential products of the fermentation process by gut microbiota, hold particular interest. SCFA are integral to energy regulation and metabolism, influencing overall well-being. Their unique characteristics, such as chain length and saturation level, provide insights into their potential effects. Alterations in SCFA metabolism can disrupt energy balance, adding to the complexity of SIDS. Leveraging machine learning (ML) presents a promising avenue for unraveling the intricate profiles of SCFA and decoding patterns indicative of heightened SIDS risk. Ensuring interpretability in healthcare is essential for building trust and developing effective prevention strategies. This research delves into understanding SIDS, with a specific focus on SCFA and their role in metabolic health. The application of ML, particularly the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Stacking model, demonstrated exceptional accuracy of 94% and 96.15% with a recall of 100% and 92.31%, respectively. The models also demonstrated strong classification capabilities, as indicated by a high True Positive Rate (TPR) in the AUC, a low Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.20, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.04 and Standard deviation (SD) of 0.10, emphasizing the robustness and precision of the approach.

AB  - Severe fetal arrhythmias may lead to fetal heart failure and even death, with fetal electrocardiogram (FECG) signals being the pivotal means for monitoring fetal cardiac health and identifying potential arrhythmias. Existing fetal arrhythmia detection methods are notably less developed compared to those for adults, and are further hindered by the scarcity of datasets and the limited variety of arrhythmia types represented, posing challenges for model generalization. Addressing these issues, this study proposes a novel QCNN-BiLSTM based fetal arrhythmia detection method to precisely categorize non-invasively acquired FECG signals into arrhythmia (ARR) and normal rhythm (NR) groups. The Quadratic Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN), with its Quadratic neurons, outperforms traditional neurons in feature extraction, effectively discerning both shared and unique features. However, the temporal limitations of QCNN due to its fixed sliding window size are overcome by integrating Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks, which excel at capturing long-term dependencies in sequential data, thereby enhancing feature extraction accuracy. Experiments conducted on the PhysioNet NIFEADB dataset validate the proposed model, achieving high performance metrics: accuracy (97.25%), recall (97.50%), F1 score (97.50%), and specificity (97.72%). To enhance the interpretability and clinical trustworthiness of the model, we incorporate SHAP values to identify the most influential features and signal segments contributing to the model's predictions. This explainability analysis not only improves the transparency of the model but also enhances its practical utility in clinical settings. Overall, this work not only provides a robust solution for early fetal arrhythmia detection, but also highlights the need for more diverse datasets in this critical area of healthcare to expand the scope and improve the generalizability of future models.

AB  - Decision-making in complex systems often relies on machine learning models, yet highly accurate models such as XGBoost and neural networks can obscure the reasoning behind their predictions. In operations research applications, understanding how a decision is made is often as crucial as the decision itself. Traditional interpretable models, such as decision trees and logistic regression, provide transparency but may struggle with datasets containing intricate feature interactions. However, complexity in decision-making stems from interactions that are only relevant within certain subsets of data. Within these subsets, feature interactions may be simplified, forming simple structures where simple interpretable models can perform effectively. We propose a bottom-up simple structure-identifying algorithm that partitions data into interpretable subgroups known as simple structures, where feature interactions are minimized, allowing simple models to be trained within each subgroup. We demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm on synthetic data and show that the decision boundaries derived from simple structures are more interpretable and aligned with the intuition of the domain than those learned from a global model. By improving both explainability and predictive accuracy, our approach provides a principled framework for decision support in applications where model transparency is essential.

AB  - Introduction Modern society's increasing stress and irregular lifestyles have led to rising insomnia prevalence, making sleep quality assessment crucial for health management. This study investigates the relationship between heart rate variability (HRV) collected from wearable devices and sleep quality, specifically focusing on wake-after-sleep-onset (WASO) as a critical marker of sleep fragmentation. We aimed to develop predictive models for next-day sleep quality using continuous digital biomarkers.Methods We conducted two experiments (winter and summer 2023) with 82 participants who wore Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 devices during wakefulness. Biometric data including HRV signals, daily step counts, and physiological indicators were collected alongside subjective questionnaire responses (PHQ-9, GAD-7, ISI, KNHANES, WHOQOL-BREF) and daily sleep logs. We analyzed seven days of preceding data to predict next-day WASO using various machine learning approaches including ARIMA, Random Forest, XGBoost, GRU, TCN, Transformers, and LSTM models.Results Among HRV features, the low-frequency to high-frequency (LF/HF) ratio emerged as the strongest correlate with WASO, showing statistically significant differences between groups (Lower LF/HF: 7.5 +/- 2.0 min vs. Higher LF/HF: 14.9 +/- 3.0 min, p=0.012). LSTM demonstrated superior predictive performance with 90.4% accuracy, 91.3% precision, and 89.9% recall for binary WASO classification. LIME analysis confirmed that LF/HF ratio, along with ISI and WHOQOL-BREF scores, were the most influential features for model predictions.Discussion This work introduces a novel approach for managing sleep health through continuous HRV monitoring and predictive modeling using wearable devices. The findings highlight the potential of the LF/HF ratio as a digital biomarker for sleep quality prediction, offering promise for personalized, data-driven healthcare interventions. The superior performance of deep learning methods underscores the value of temporal pattern recognition in sleep quality assessment, paving the way for proactive sleep health management in everyday life.

AB  - Lung diseases, such as asthma, pneumonia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pose considerable global health issues, making early diagnosis essential for effective treatment. Traditional diagnostic techniques for these ailments, especially auscultation using a stethoscope, are subjective and susceptible to inaccuracies. This study introduces CALMNet, a deep learning model that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and a TimeDistributed layer to accurately analyze lung sounds by considering both their spatial and time-related features. The model is trained and assessed utilizing the ICBHI dataset, which encompasses a varied collection of lung sounds from patients with various respiratory ailments. Preprocessing techniques, including double denoising (FFT and high-pass filtering), were utilized to enhance the audio data quality, while feature extraction methods such as Mel Spectrograms, Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), and Chroma Short-Time Fourier Transform (ChromaSTFT) were employed to capture the fundamental characteristics of lung sounds. The results show that CALMNet achieves an impressive accuracy of 97.65%, with an F1-score of 0.909, precision of 0.911, and recall of 0.90, outperforming other models like CNNs and LSTMs. CALMNet exhibits enhanced efficacy in differentiating various lung illnesses, as evidenced by the confusion matrix and ROC curve analysis. The model's exceptional accuracy and strong performance indicate its promise as an effective instrument for the automated classification of lung illnesses, providing a dependable, objective, and scalable option for clinical use. Future endeavors will concentrate on augmenting the dataset, enhancing model interpretability, and executing real-time diagnostic applications to further elevate its applicability in healthcare environments.

AB  - BackgroundUnderstanding the metabolic activities of the gut microbiome is vital for deciphering its impact on human health. While direct measurement of these metabolites through metabolomics is effective, it is often expensive and time-consuming. In contrast, microbial composition data obtained through sequencing is more accessible, making it a promising resource for predicting metabolite profiles. However, current computational models frequently face challenges related to limited prediction accuracy, generalizability, and interpretability.MethodHere, we present the Deep Mixture of Variational Gaussian Process Experts (DMoVGPE) model, designed to overcome these issues. DMoVGPE utilizes a dynamic gating mechanism, implemented through a neural network with fully connected layers and dropout for regularization, to select the most relevant Gaussian Process experts. During training, the gating network refines expert selection, dynamically adjusting their contribution based on the input features. The model also incorporates an Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD) mechanism, which assigns relevance scores to microbial features by evaluating their predictive power. Features linked to metabolite profiles are given smaller length scales to increase their influence, while irrelevant features are down-weighted through larger length scales, improving both prediction accuracy and interpretability.ConclusionsThrough extensive evaluations on various datasets, DMoVGPE consistently achieves higher prediction performance than existing models. Furthermore, our model reveals significant associations between specific microbial taxa and metabolites, aligning well with findings from existing studies. These results highlight DMoVGPE's potential to provide accurate predictions and to uncover biologically meaningful relationships, paving the way for its application in disease research and personalized healthcare strategies.

AB  - The widespread use of artificial intelligence deep neural networks (DNNs) in fields such as medicine and engineering necessitates understanding their decision-making processes. Current explainability methods often produce inconsistent results and struggle to highlight essential signals influencing model inferences. This paper introduces the Evolutionary Independent Deterministic Explanation (EVIDENCE) theory, a novel approach offering a deterministic, model-independent method for extracting significant signals from black-box models. EVIDENCE theory, grounded in robust mathematical formalization, is validated through empirical tests on diverse datasets, including COVID-19 audio diagnostics, Parkinson's disease voice recordings, and the George Tzanetakis music classification dataset (GTZAN). Practical applications of EVIDENCE include improving diagnostic accuracy in healthcare and enhancing audio signal analysis. For instance, in the COVID-19 use case, EVIDENCE-filtered spectrograms fed into a frozen Residual Network with 50 layers (ResNet50) improved precision by 32 % for positive cases and increased the Area Under the Curve (AUC) by 16 % compared to baseline models. For Parkinson's disease classification, EVIDENCE achieved near-perfect precision and sensitivity, with a macro average F1-Score of 0.997. In the GTZAN, EVIDENCE maintained a high AUC of 0.996, demonstrating its efficacy in filtering relevant features for accurate genre classification. EVIDENCE outperformed other Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods such as Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and Gradient-weighted ClassActivation Mapping (GradCAM) in almost all metrics. These findings indicate that EVIDENCE not only improves classification accuracy but also provides a transparent and reproducible explanation mechanism, crucial for advancing the trustworthiness and applicability of AI systems in real-world settings.

AB  - BackgroundAllocation of scarce organs for transplantation is ethically challenging. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been proposed to assist in liver allocation, however the ethics of this remains unexplored and the view of the public unknown. The aim of this paper was to assess public attitudes on whether AI should be used in liver allocation and how it should be implemented.MethodsWe first introduce some potential ethical issues concerning AI in liver allocation, before analysing a pilot survey including online responses from 172 UK laypeople, recruited through Prolific Academic.FindingsMost participants found AI in liver allocation acceptable (69.2%) and would not be less likely to donate their organs if AI was used in allocation (72.7%). Respondents thought AI was more likely to be consistent and less biased compared to humans, although were concerned about the "dehumanisation of healthcare" and whether AI could consider important nuances in allocation decisions. Participants valued accuracy, impartiality, and consistency in a decision-maker, more than interpretability and empathy. Respondents were split on whether AI should be trained on previous decisions or programmed with specific objectives. Whether allocation decisions were made by transplant committee or AI, participants valued consideration of urgency, survival likelihood, life years gained, age, future medication compliance, quality of life, future alcohol use and past alcohol use. On the other hand, the majority thought the following factors were not relevant to prioritisation: past crime, future crime, future societal contribution, social disadvantage, and gender.ConclusionsThere are good reasons to use AI in liver allocation, and our sample of participants appeared to support its use. If confirmed, this support would give democratic legitimacy to the use of AI in this context and reduce the risk that donation rates could be affected negatively. Our findings on specific ethical concerns also identify potential expectations and reservations laypeople have regarding AI in this area, which can inform how AI in liver allocation could be best implemented.

AB  - Healthcare using body sensor data has been getting huge research attentions by a wide range of researchers because of its good practical applications such as smart health care systems. For instance, smart wearable sensor-based behavior recognition system can observe elderly people in a smart eldercare environment to improve their lifestyle and can also help them by warning about forthcoming unprecedented events such as falls or other health risk, to prolong their independent life. Although there are many ways of using distinguished sensors to observe behavior of people, wearable sensors mostly provide reliable data in this regard to monitor the individual's functionality and lifestyle. In this paper, we propose a body sensor-based activity modeling and recognition system using time-sequential information-based deep Neural Structured Learning (NSL), a promising deep learning algorithm. First, we obtain data from multiple wearable sensors while the subjects conduct several daily activities. Once the data is collected, the time-sequential information then go through some statistical feature processing. Furthermore, kernel-based discriminant analysis (KDA) is applied to see the better clustering of the features from different activity classes by minimizing inner-class scatterings while maximizing inter-class scatterings of the samples. The robust time-sequential features are then applied with Neural Structured Learning (NSL) based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), for activity modeling. The proposed approach achieved around 99% recall rate on a public dataset. It is also compared to existing different conventional machine learning methods such as typical Deep Belief Network (DBN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) where they yielded the maximum recall rate of 94%. Furthermore, a fast and efficient explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) algorithm, Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) is used to explain and check the machine learning decisions. The robust activity recognition system can be adopted for understanding peoples' behavior in their daily life in different environments such as homes, clinics, and offices.

KW  - REGRESSION
AB  - During 2020, the infection rate of COVID-19 has been investigated by many scholars from different research fields. In this context, reliable and interpretable forecasts of disease incidents are a vital tool for policymakers to manage healthcare resources. In this context, several experts have called for the necessity to account for human mobility to explain the spread of COVID-19. Existing approaches often apply standard models of the respective research field, frequently restricting modeling possibilities. For instance, most statistical or epidemiological models cannot directly incorporate unstructured data sources, including relational data that may encode human mobility. In contrast, machine learning approaches may yield better predictions by exploiting these data structures yet lack intuitive interpretability as they are often categorized as black-box models. We propose a combination of both research directions and present a multimodal learning framework that amalgamates statistical regression and machine learning models for predicting local COVID-19 cases in Germany. Results and implications: the novel approach introduced enables the use of a richer collection of data types, including mobility flows and colocation probabilities, and yields the lowest mean squared error scores throughout the observational period in the reported benchmark study. The results corroborate that during most of the observational period more dispersed meeting patterns and a lower percentage of people staying put are associated with higher infection rates. Moreover, the analysis underpins the necessity of including mobility data and showcases the flexibility and interpretability of the proposed approach.

AB  - Though deep learning has shown successful performance in classifying the label and severity stage of certain diseases, most of them give few explanations on how to make predictions. Inspired by Koch's Postulates, the foundation in evidence-based medicine (EBM) to identify the pathogen, we propose to exploit the interpretability of deep learning application in medical diagnosis. By isolating neuron activation patterns from a diabetic retinopathy (DR) detector and visualizing them, we can determine the symptoms that the DR detector identifies as evidence to make prediction. To be specific, we first define novel pathological descriptors using activated neurons of the DR detector to encode both spatial and appearance information of lesions. Then, to visualize the symptom encoded in the descriptor, we propose Patho-GAN, a new network to synthesize medically plausible retinal images. By manipulating these descriptors, we could even arbitrarily control the position, quantity, and categories of generated lesions. We also show that our synthesized images carry the symptoms directly related to diabetic retinopathy diagnosis. Our generated images are both qualitatively and quantitatively superior to the ones by previous methods. Besides, compared to existing methods that take hours to generate an image, our second level speed endows the potential to be an effective solution for data augmentation.

AB  - Deep neural networks (DNN) have remarkably progressed in applications involving large and complex datasets but have been criticized as a black-box. This downside has recently become a motivation for the research community to pursue the ideas of hybrid approaches, resulting in novel hybrid systems classified as deep neuro-fuzzy systems (DNFS). Studies regarding the implementation of DNFS have rapidly increased in the domains of computing, healthcare, transportation, and finance with high interpretability and reasonable accuracy. However, relatively few survey studies have been found in the literature to provide a comprehensive insight into this domain. Therefore, this study aims to perform a systematic review to evaluate the current progress, trends, arising issues, research gaps, challenges, and future scope related to DNFS studies. A study mapping process was prepared to guide a systematic search for publications related to DNFS published between 2015 and 2020 using five established scientific directories. As a result, a total of 105 studies were identified and critically analyzed to address research questions with the objectives: (i) to understand the concept of DNFS; (ii) to find out DNFS optimization methods; (iii) to visualize the intensity of work carried out in DNFS domain; and (iv) to highlight DNFS application subjects and domains. We believe that this study provides up-to-date guidance for future research in the DNFS domain, allowing for more effective advancement in techniques and processes. The analysis made in this review proves that DNFS-based research is actively growing with a substantial implementation and application scope in the future.

AB  - BackgroundIn the field of computational personalized medicine, drug response prediction (DRP) is a critical issue. However, existing studies often characterize drugs as strings, a representation that does not align with the natural description of molecules. Additionally, they ignore gene pathway-specific combinatorial implication.ResultsIn this study, we propose drug Graph and gene Pathway based Drug response prediction method (GPDRP), a new multimodal deep learning model for predicting drug responses based on drug molecular graphs and gene pathway activity. In GPDRP, drugs are represented by molecular graphs, while cell lines are described by gene pathway activity scores. The model separately learns these two types of data using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) with Graph Transformers and deep neural networks. Predictions are subsequently made through fully connected layers.ConclusionsOur results indicate that Graph Transformer-based model delivers superior performance. We apply GPDRP on hundreds of cancer cell lines' bulk RNA-sequencing data, and it outperforms some recently published models. Furthermore, the generalizability and applicability of GPDRP are demonstrated through its predictions on unknown drug-cell line pairs and xenografts. This underscores the interpretability achieved by incorporating gene pathways.

AB  - The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a significant impact on patients and healthcare systems across the world. Distinguishing non-COVID-19 patients from COVID-19 patients at the lowest possible cost and in the earliest stages of the disease is a major issue. Additionally, the implementation of explainable deep learning decisions is another issue, especially in critical fields such as medicine. The study presents a method to train deep learning models and apply an uncertainty-based ensemble voting policy to achieve 99% accuracy in classifying COVID-19 chest X-rays from normal and pneumonia-related infections. We further present a training scheme that integrates the cyclic cosine annealing approach with cross-validation and uncertainty quantification that is measured using prediction interval coverage probability (PICP) as final ensemble voting weights. We also propose the Uncertain-CAM technique, which improves deep learning explainability and provides a more reliable COVID-19 classification system. We introduce a new image processing technique to measure the explainability based on ground-truth, and we compared it with the widely adopted Grad-CAM method.

AB  - Electronic health records provide rich, heterogeneous data about the evolution of the patients' health status. However, such data need to be processed carefully, with the aim of extracting meaningful information for clinical decision support. In this paper, we leverage interpretable (deep) learning and signal processing tools to deal with multivariate time-series data collected from the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the University Hospital of Fuenlabrada (Madrid, Spain). The presence of antimicrobial multidrug-resistant (AMR) bacteria is one of the greatest threats to the health system in general and to the ICUs in particular due to the critical health status of the patients therein. Thus, early identification of bacteria at the ICU and early prediction of their antibiotic resistance are key for the patients' prognosis. While intelligent data-based processing and learning schemes can contribute to this early prediction, their acceptance and deployment in the ICUs require the automatic schemes to be not only accurate but also understandable by clinicians. Accordingly, we have designed trustworthy intelligent models for the early prediction of AMR based on the combination of meaningful feature selection with interpretable recurrent neural networks. These models were created using irregularly sampled clinical measurements, both considering the health status of the patient and the global ICU environment. We explored several strategies to cope with strongly imbalance data, since only a few ICU patients are infected by AMR bacteria. It is worth noting that our approach exhibits a good balance between performance and interpretability, especially when considering the difficulty of the classification task at hand. A multitude of factors are involved in the emergence of AMR (several of them not fully understood), and the records only contain a subset of them. In addition, the limited number of patients, the imbalance between classes, and the irregularity of the data render the problem harder to solve. Our models are also enriched with SHAP post-hoc interpretability and validated by clinicians who considered model understandability and trustworthiness of paramount concern for pragmatic purposes. Moreover, we use linguistic fuzzy systems to provide clinicians with explanations in natural language. Such explanations are automatically generated from a pool of interpretable rules that describe the interaction among the most relevant features identified by SHAP. Notice that clinicians were especially satisfied with new insights provided by our models. Such insights helped them to trust the automatic schemes and use them to make (better) decisions to mitigate AMR spreading in the ICU. All in all, this work paves the way towards more comprehensible time-series analysis in the context of early AMR prediction in ICUs and reduces the time of detection of infectious diseases, opening the door to better hospital care.

AB  - The accurate automatic segmentation of gliomas and its intra-tumoral structures is important not only for treatment planning but also for follow-up evaluations. Several methods based on 2D and 3D Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have been developed to segment brain tumors and to classify different categories of tumors from different MRI modalities. However, these networks are often black-box models and do not provide any evidence regarding the process they take to perform this task. Increasing transparency and interpretability of such deep learning techniques is necessary for the complete integration of such methods into medical practice. In this paper, we explore various techniques to explain the functional organization of brain tumor segmentation models and to extract visualizations of internal concepts to understand how these networks achieve highly accurate tumor segmentations. We use the BraTS 2018 dataset to train three different networks with standard architectures and outline similarities and differences in the process that these networks take to segment brain tumors. We show that brain tumor segmentation networks learn certain human-understandable disentangled concepts on a filter level. We also show that they take a top-down or hierarchical approach to localizing the different parts of the tumor. We then extract visualizations of some internal feature maps and also provide a measure of uncertainty with regards to the outputs of the models to give additional qualitative evidence about the predictions of these networks. We believe that the emergence of such human-understandable organization and concepts might aid in the acceptance and integration of such methods in medical diagnosis.

AB  - Graphs are a powerful tool for representing and analyzing unstructured, non-Euclidean data ubiquitous in the healthcare domain. Two prominent examples are molecule property prediction and brain connectome analysis. Importantly, recent works have shown that considering relationships between input data samples has a positive regularizing effect on the downstream task in healthcare applications. These relationships are naturally modeled by a (possibly unknown) graph structure between input samples. In this work, we propose Graph-in-Graph (GiG), a neural network architecture for protein classification and brain imaging applications that exploits the graph representation of the input data samples and their latent relation. We assume an initially unknown latent-graph structure between graph-valued input data and propose to learn a parametric model for message passing within and across input graph samples, end-to-end along with the latent structure connecting the input graphs. Further, we introduce a Node Degree Distribution Loss (NDDL) that regularizes the predicted latent relationships structure. This regularization can significantly improve the downstream task. Moreover, the obtained latent graph can represent patient population models or networks of molecule clusters, providing a level of interpretability and knowledge discovery in the input domain, which is of particular value in healthcare.

AB  - Thanks to the huge accumulation of Electronic Health Records (EHRs), numerous deep learning based predictive models were proposed for this task. Among them, most of the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models were built with recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Regardless of their success, RNN-based models mainly suffer from three limitations. (i) Accuracy: the prediction accuracy of RNN-based models drops quickly as the length of EHR sequences increases. (ii) Efficiency: the recurrence property of RNN-based models makes the computation parallelization impossible, and accordingly hurts the efficiency of such models in practice. (iii) Interpretability: the outputs of RNN-based models are difficult to explain due to the unexplainable nature of deep models. In this paper, we resort to the recently advanced attention mechanism to model the dependencies between inputs and outputs, which overcomes shortages of RNN-based models in accuracy and efficiency. As for interpretability, we model the relationships with two linear mappings from the input to the output, which account for two important factors-one is for context-aware information and the other is for time-aware representation-of capturing discriminative features in learning patient's representations. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in both accuracy and computational efficiency, meanwhile, analyze and discuss the reasonability of each explanation approach.

AB  - Rule extraction from artificial neural networks (ANNs) refers to the process of identifying the underlying decision-making logic used by the network in its predictions. This involves converting the complex, non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs in the network into a set of interpretable rules. The main objective of rule extraction is to enhance the interpretability of decision-making in artificial neural networks (ANNs) and make it more understandable for human experts, especially in critical domains like healthcare, where clear decision-making is essential. Despite the ability of machine learning methods to interpret ANNs, interpreting complex neural networks remains limited, as most studies tend to sacrifice one criterion, related to rule quality, in favor of another. Rule extraction methods applied directly to complex neural networks may produce overly specific rules that are tailored to the training data. Such rules can suffer from overfitting and may not generalize well to unseen data. Also, The use of multiobjective genetic algorithms for rule extraction can result in a large number of rules, making it challenging for decision-makers to interpret them. This study proposes an innovative approach to address challenges in rule extraction from complex artificial neural networks (ANNs) by integrating a multiobjective genetic algorithm with the PROMETHEE method. By integrating these techniques, the study aims to identify meaningful relationships between inputs and outputs of ANNs, generating concise and reliable rules that are ranked based on support, confidence, and lift values. The use of PROMETHEE's rule ranking mechanism enabled the consideration of rule priority during candidate selection, guiding the genetic algorithm towards discovering high-quality rule sets and efficiently exploring the search space. This approach not only enhances the quality of extracted rules but also facilitates efficient decision-making by striking a balance between rule accuracy, fidelity, and comprehensibility, thus contributing to advancing the understanding of complex neural networks. By equally weighting the criteria (support, confidence, and lift) during the rule ranking mechanism, our approach achieved high coverage rates ranging from 94.88 % to 100 % and generated a manageable number of rules that could be easily interpreted by human experts, ranging from 5 to 10.5. These findings demonstrate the potential of our approach to significantly improve decision-making accuracy and interpretability across various real-world applications, making it a promising tool for applications in healthcare, finance, and other fields.

AB  - We present ScrutinAI, a Visual Analytics tool to leverage semantic understanding for deep neural network (DNN) prediction analysis, focusing on models for object detection and semantic segmentation. Typical fields of application for such models, e.g., autonomous driving or healthcare, have a high demand for uncovering and mitigating data-and model-inherent shortcomings. Our approach helps analysts and/or auditors use their semantic understanding to identify and investigate potential weaknesses in DNN models. ScrutinAI includes interactive visualizations of the model's inputs and outputs, interactive plots with linked brushing, data filtering with textual queries on descriptive meta data and an interactive similarity based image retrieval feature. The different views and data filtering options enable global and local inspection of DNN predictions. Overall, the tool fosters hypothesis driven knowledge generation which aids in understanding the model's inner reasoning. Insights gained during the analysis process mitigate the "black-box character"of the DNN and thus support model improvement and the generation of a safety argumentation for AI applications. We present two case studies on the investigation of DNN models for pedestrian detection from the automotive domain.& COPY; 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Personalized time-to-event or survival prediction with right-censored outcomes is a pervasive challenge in healthcare research. Although various supervised machine learning methods, such as random survival forests or neural networks, have been adapted to handle such outcomes effectively, they do not provide explanations for their predictions, lacking interpretability. In this paper, an alternative method for survival prediction by weighted nearest neighbors is proposed. Fitting this model to data entails optimizing the weights by learning a metric. An individual prediction of this method can be explained by providing the user with the most influential data points for this prediction, i.e., the closest data points and their weights. The strengths and weaknesses in terms of predictive performance are highlighted on simulated data and an application of the method on two different real-world datasets of breast cancer patients shows its competitiveness with established methods.

AB  - Nowadays, many sequences of events are generated in areas as diverse as healthcare, finance, and social network. People have been studying these data for a long time. They hope to predict the type and occurrence time of the next event by using relationships among events in the data. recently, with the successful application of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) in natural language processing, it has been introduced into point process. However, RNN cannot capture the long-term dependence among events well, and self-attention can partially mitigate this problem precisely. Transformer Hawkes Process (THP) using self-attention greatly improves the performance of the Hawkes Process, but THP cannot ignore the effect of irrelevant events, which will affect the computational complexity and prediction accuracy of the model. In this paper, we propose an Adaptively Sparse Transformers Hawkes Process (ASTHP). ASTHP considers the periodicity and nonlinearity of event time in the time encoding process. The sparsity of the ASTHP is achieved by substituting Softmax with & alpha;-entmax: & alpha;-entmax is a differentiable generalization of Softmax that allows unrelated events to gain exact zero weight. By optimizing the neural network parameters, different attention heads can adaptively select sparse modes (from Softmax to Sparsemax). Compared with the existing models, ASTHP model not only ensures the prediction performance but also improves the interpretability of the model. For example, the accuracy of ASTHP model on MIMIC-II dataset is improved by nearly 3 percentage points, and the model fitting degree and stability are also improved significantly.

AB  - Electronic health records (EHRs) have been heavily used in modern healthcare systems for recording patients' admission information to health facilities. Many data-driven approaches employ temporal features in EHR for predicting specific diseases, readmission times, and diagnoses of patients. However, most existing predictive models cannot fully utilize EHR data, due to an inherent lack of labels in supervised training for some temporal events. Moreover, it is hard for the existing methods to simultaneously provide generic and personalized interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose Sherbet, a self-supervised graph learning framework with hyperbolic embeddings for temporal health event prediction. We first propose a hyperbolic embedding method with information flow to pretrain medical code representations in a hierarchical structure. We incorporate these pretrained representations into a graph neural network (GNN) to detect disease complications and design a multilevel attention method to compute the contributions of particular diseases and admissions, thus enhancing personalized interpretability. We present a new hierarchy-enhanced historical prediction proxy task in our self-supervised learning framework to fully utilize EHR data and exploit medical domain knowledge. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments on widely used publicly available EHR datasets to verify the effectiveness of our model. Our results demonstrate the proposed model's strengths in both predictive tasks and interpretable abilities.

AB  - Background Mortality prediction is an important task to achieve smart healthcare, especially for the management of intensive care unit. It can provide a reference for doctors to quickly predict the course of disease and customize early intervention programs for the patients in need. With the development of the electronic medical records, deep learning methods are introduced to deal with the prediction task. In the electronic medical records, clinical notes always contain rich and diverse medical information, including the clinical histories and reports during admission. Mortality prediction methods mostly rely on the temporal events such as medical examinations and ignore the related reports and history information in the clinical notes. We hope that we can utilize both temporal events and clinical notes information to get better mortality prediction results. Results We propose a multimodal temporal-clinical note network to model both temporal and clinical notes. Specifically, the clinical text are further processed for differentiating the chronic illness patients in the historical information of clinical notes from non-chronic illness patients. In order to further mine the information related to the mortality in the text, we learn the time series embedding with Long Short Term Memory networks and the clinical notes embedding with a label aware convolutional neural network. We also propose a scoring function to measure the importance of clinical note sections. Our approach achieved a better AUCPR and AUCROC than competing methods and visual explanations for word importance showed the interpretability improvement of the model. Conclusions We have tested our methodology on the MIMIC-III dataset. Contributions of different clinical note sections were uncovered by visualization methods. Our work demonstrates that the introduction of the medical history related information can improve the performance of the mortality prediction. Using label aware convolutional neural networks can further improve the results.

AB  - As a non-invasive medical imaging scanning device, ultrasound has greatly increased the efficiency and accuracy of medical diagnosis. In recent years, portable ultrasound is being more widely used for its convenience and lower cost. Patients and physicians can receive the scanned images on their mobile phones at any time via a wireless network with low latency. However, it is difficult for portable ultrasound devices to capture images with the same quality as standard hospital ultrasound image acquisition systems. Usually, the images captured by portable ultrasound equipment have considerable noise. This noise undoubtedly affects the diagnosis of the physician. It is imperative to develop methods to remove the noise while preserving important information in the image. For this reason, we propose a novel denoising neural network model, called Feature-guided Denoising Convolutional Neural Network (FDCNN), to remove noise while retaining important feature information. In order to achieve high-quality denoising results, we employ a hierarchical denoising framework driven by a feature masking layer for medical images. Furthermore, we propose a feature extraction algorithm based on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) for medical images. Experimental results show that our medical image feature extraction method outperforms previous methods. Combined with the new denoising neural network architecture, portable ultrasound devices can now achieve better diagnostic performance.

AB  - Research of visual neural networks (VNNs) is one of the most important topics in deep learning and has received wide attention from industry and academia for their promising performance. The applications of VNNs range from image classification and target detection to scene segmentation in various fields such as transportation, healthcare and finance. In general, VNNs can be divided into two types: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer networks. In the last decade, CNNs have dominated the research of vision tasks. Recently, Transformer networks are successfully used in the fields of natural language processing and computer vision, and have achieved remarkable performance in many vision tasks. In this paper, the basic architectures and current trends of these two types of VNNs are first introduced. Then, three major challenges of VNNs are pointed out: scalability, robustness and interpretability. Next, the lightweight, robust and interpretable solutions are summarized and analyzed. Finally, the future opportunities of VNNs are presented.

AB  - Sepsis is associated with high mortality-particularly in low-middle income countries (LMICs). Critical care management of sepsis is challenging in LMICs due to the lack of care providers and the high cost of bedside monitors. Recent advances in wearable sensor technology and machine learning (ML) models in healthcare promise to deliver new ways of digital monitoring integrated with automated decision systems to reduce the mortality risk in sepsis. In this study, firstly, we aim to assess the feasibility of using wearable sensors instead of traditional bedside monitors in the sepsis care management of hospital admitted patients, and secondly, to introduce automated prediction models for the mortality prediction of sepsis patients. To this end, we continuously monitored 50 sepsis patients for nearly 24 h after their admission to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Vietnam. We then compared the performance and interpretability of state-of-the-art ML models for the task of mortality prediction of sepsis using the heart rate variability (HRV) signal from wearable sensors and vital signs from bedside monitors. Our results show that all ML models trained on wearable data outperformed ML models trained on data gathered from the bedside monitors for the task of mortality prediction with the highest performance (area under the precision recall curve = 0.83) achieved using time-varying features of HRV and recurrent neural networks. Our results demonstrate that the integration of automated ML prediction models with wearable technology is well suited for helping clinicians who manage sepsis patients in LMICs to reduce the mortality risk of sepsis.

AB  - Background: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a condition that is often considered to have broad and subjective diagnostic criteria and is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. Early and accurate prediction of ARDS and related conditions such as hypoxemia and sepsis could allow timely administration of therapies, leading to improved patient outcomes.
   Objective: The aim of this study is to perform an exploration of how multilabel classification in the clinical setting can take advantage of the underlying dependencies between ARDS and related conditions to improve early prediction of ARDS in patients.
   Methods: The electronic health record data set included 40,703 patient encounters from 7 hospitals from April 20, 2018, to March 17, 2021. A recurrent neural network (RNN) was trained using data from 5 hospitals, and external validation was conducted on data from 2 hospitals. In addition to ARDS, 12 target labels for related conditions such as sepsis, hypoxemia, and COVID-19 were used to train the model to classify a total of 13 outputs. As a comparator, XGBoost models were developed for each of the 13 target labels. Model performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Heat maps to visualize attention scores were generated to provide interpretability to the neural networks. Finally, cluster analysis was performed to identify potential phenotypic subgroups of patients with ARDS.
   Results: The single RNN model trained to classify 13 outputs outperformed the individual XGBoost models for ARDS prediction, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.842 on the external test sets. Models trained on an increasing number of tasks resulted in improved performance. Earlier prediction of ARDS nearly doubled the rate of in-hospital survival. Cluster analysis revealed distinct ARDS subgroups, some of which had similar mortality rates but different clinical presentations.
   Conclusions: The RNN model presented in this paper can be used as an early warning system to stratify patients who are at risk of developing one of the multiple risk outcomes, hence providing practitioners with the means to take early action.

AB  - Chest X-ray (CXR) is commonly performed as an initial investigation in COVID-19, whose fast and accurate diagnosis is critical. Recently, deep learning has a great potential in detecting people who are suspected to be infected with COVID-19. However, deep learning resulting with black-box models, which often breaks down when forced to make predictions about data for which limited supervised information is available and lack inter-pretability, still is a major barrier for clinical integration. In this work, we hereby propose a semantic-powered explainable model-free few-shot learning scheme to quickly and precisely diagnose COVID-19 with higher reliability and transparency. Specifically, we design a Report Image Explanation Cell (RIEC) to exploit clinically indicators derived from radiology reports as interpretable driver to introduce prior knowledge at training. Meanwhile, multi-task collaborative diagnosis strategy (MCDS) is developed to construct N-way k-shot tasks, which adopts a cyclic and collaborative training approach for producing better generalization performance on new tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves competitive results (accuracy of 98.91%, precision of 98.95%, recall of 97.94% and F1-score of 98.57%) to diagnose COVID-19 and other pneumonia infected categories, even with only 200 paired CXR images and radiology reports for training. Furthermore, statistical results of comparative experiments show that our scheme provides an interpretable window into the COVID-19 diagnosis to improve the performance of the small sample size, the reliability and transparency of black-box deep learning models. Our source codes will be released on https://github.com/AI-medical-diagnosis-team-of-JNU/SPEMFSL-Diagnosis-COVID-19.

AB  - Background Presently, there is a wide variety of classification methods and deep neural network approaches in bioinformatics. Deep neural networks have proven their effectiveness for classification tasks, and have outperformed classical methods, but they suffer from a lack of interpretability. Therefore, these innovative methods are not appropriate for decision support systems in healthcare. Indeed, to allow clinicians to make informed and well thought out decisions, the algorithm should provide the main pieces of information used to compute the predicted diagnosis and/or prognosis, as well as a confidence score for this prediction. Methods Herein, we used a new supervised autoencoder (SAE) approach for classification of clinical metabolomic data. This new method has the advantage of providing a confidence score for each prediction thanks to a softmax classifier and a meaningful latent space visualization and to include a new efficient feature selection method, with a structured constraint, which allows for biologically interpretable results. Results Experimental results on three metabolomics datasets of clinical samples illustrate the effectiveness of our SAE and its confidence score. The supervised autoencoder provides an accurate localization of the patients in the latent space, and an efficient confidence score. Experiments show that the SAE outperforms classical methods (PLS-DA, Random Forests, SVM, and neural networks (NN)). Furthermore, the metabolites selected by the SAE were found to be biologically relevant. Conclusion In this paper, we describe a new efficient SAE method to support diagnostic or prognostic evaluation based on metabolomics analyses.

AB  - Hospital readmission shortly after discharge threatens the quality of patient care and leads to increased medical care costs. In the United States, hospitals with high readmission rates are subject to federal financial penalties. This concern calls for incentives for healthcare facilities to reduce their readmission rates by predicting patients who are at high risk of readmission. Conventional practices involve the use of rule-based assessment scores and traditional statistical methods, such as logistic regression, in developing risk prediction models. The recent advancements in machine learning driven by improved computing power and sophisticated algorithms have the potential to produce highly accurate predictions. However, the value of such models could be overrated. Meanwhile, the use of other flexible models that leverage simple algorithms offer great transparency in terms of feature interpretation, which is beneficial in clinical settings. This work presents an overview of the current trends in risk prediction models developed in the field of readmission. The various techniques adopted by researchers in recent years are described, and the topic of whether complex models outperform simple ones in readmission risk stratification is investigated.

KW  - DISEASE
AB  - Automatic representation learning of key entities in electronic health record (EHR) data is a critical step for healthcare data mining that turns heterogeneous medical records into structured and actionable information. Here we propose ME2Vec, an algorithmic framework for learning continuous low-dimensional embedding vectors of the most common entities in EHR: medical services, doctors, and patients. ME2Vec features a hierarchical structure that encapsulates different node embedding schemes to cater for the unique characteristic of each medical entity. To embed medical services, we employ a biased-random-walk-based node embedding that leverages the irregular time intervals of medical services in EHR to embody their relative importance. To embed doctors and patients, we adhere to the principle "it's what you do that defines you" and derive their embeddings based on their interactions with other types of entities through graph neural network and proximity-preserving network embedding, respectively. Using real-world clinical data, we demonstrate the efficacy of ME2Vec over competitive baselines on diagnosis prediction, readmission prediction, as well as recommending doctors to patients based on their medical conditions. In addition, medical service embeddings pretrained using ME2Vec can substantially improve the performance of sequential models in predicting patients clinical outcomes. Overall, ME2Vec can serve as a general-purpose representation learning algorithm for EHR data and benefit various downstream tasks in terms of both performance and interpretability.

AB  - Deep neural network (DNN) models have achieved phenomenal success for applications in many domains, ranging from academic research in science and engineering to industry and business. The modeling power of DNN is believed to have come from the complexity and over-parameterization of the model, which on the other hand has been criticized for the lack of interpretation. Although certainly not true for every application, in some applications, especially in economics, social science, healthcare industry, and administrative decision making, scientists or practitioners are resistant to use predictions made by a black-box system for multiple reasons. One reason is that a major purpose of a study can be to make discoveries based upon the prediction function, e.g., to reveal the relationships between measurements. Another reason can be that the training dataset is not large enough to make researchers feel completely sure about a purely data-driven result. Being able to examine and interpret the prediction function will enable researchers to connect the result with existing knowledge or gain insights about new directions to explore. Although classic statistical models are much more explainable, their accuracy often falls considerably below DNN. In this paper, we propose an approach to fill the gap between relatively simple explainable models and DNN such that we can more flexibly tune the trade-off between interpretability and accuracy. Our main idea is a mixture of discriminative models that is trained with the guidance from a DNN. Although mixtures of discriminative models have been studied before, our way of generating the mixture is quite different.

AB  - Medical text classification assigns medical related text into different categories such as topics or disease types. Machine learning based techniques have been widely used to perform such tasks despite the obvious drawback in such black box approach, leaving no easy way to fine-tune the resultant model for better performance. We propose a novel constructive heuristic approach to generate a set of regular expressions that can be used as effective text classifiers. The main innovation of our approach is that we develop a novel regular expression based text classifier with both satisfactory classification performance and excellent interpretability. We evaluate our framework on real-world medical data provided by our collaborator, one of the largest online healthcare providers in the market, and observe the high performance and consistency of this approach. Experimental results show that the machine-generated regular expressions can be effectively used in conjunction with machine learning techniques to perform medical text classification tasks. The proposed methodology improves the performance of baseline methods (Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines) by 9 in precision and 4.5 in recall. We also evaluate the performance of modified regular expressions by human experts and demonstrate the potential of practical applications using the proposed method.

AB  - Reinforcement learning based on the deep neural network has attracted much attention and has been widely used in real-world applications. However, the black-box property limits its usage from applying in high-stake areas, such as manufacture and healthcare. To deal with this problem, some researchers resort to the interpretable control policy generation algorithm. The basic idea is to use an interpretable model, such as tree-based genetic programming, to extract policy from other black box modes, such as neural networks. Following this idea, in this paper, we try yet another form of the genetic programming technique, evolutionary feature synthesis, to extract control policy from the neural network. We also propose an evolutionary method to optimize the operator set of the control policy for each specific problem automatically. Moreover, a policy simplification strategy is also introduced. We conduct experiments on four reinforcement learning environments. The experiment results reveal that evolutionary feature synthesis can achieve better performance than tree-based genetic programming to extract policy from the neural network with comparable interpretability.

AB  - The explanation of the decisions provided by a model are crucial in a domain such as medical diagnosis. With the advent of deep learning, it is very important to explain why a classification is reached by a model. This work tackles the transparency problem of convolutional neural networks(CNNs). We propose to generate propositional rules from CNNs, because they are intuitive to the way humans reason. Our method considers that a CNN is the union of two subnetworks: a multi-layer erceptron (MLP) in the fully connected layers; and a subnetwork including several 2D convolutional layers and max-pooling layers. Rule extraction exhibits two main steps, with each step generating rules from each subnetwork of the CNN. In practice, we approximate the two subnetworks by two particular MLP models that makes it possible to generate propositional rules. We performed the experiments with two datasets involving images: MNISTdigit recognition; and skin-cancer diagnosis. With high fidelity, the extracted rules designated the location of discriminant pixels, as well as the conditions that had to be met to achieve the classification. We illustrated several examples of rules by their centroids and their discriminant pixels.

AB  - Medical diagnosis and monitoring benefit from exploiting the advantages of motor imagery (MI) training, which highly depends on the proper interpretation of elicited brain activity responses. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are increasingly used to improve MI classification performance by employing multi-view extracted features (time, frequency, and spatial). However, deep learning gains knowledge from abundant, complex neural models, resulting in poor interpretability assessments. Here, to enhance the understanding of imagined actions, we develop the relevance analysis of topographic time-frequency representation, preserving an adequate classification performance. Namely, to deal better with the subject variability, a 2D feature combination of continuous wavelet transform and common spatial patterns is extracted to feed a Deep&Wide learning model, assessing the relevance of input multi-view representation that contribute the best to the classifier accuracy. We estimate the feature contribution through the information back-propagated across the hidden layers' weights before predicting the output label. Evaluation, presented in two databases with bi- and four-label MI tasks, proves that the developed Deep&Wide-based relevance analysis reveals insights about the electrodes, time segments, and frequency bands with relevant MI neural responses, favoring explanation of inter and intra-subject variability because of coordination skills.

AB  - Although many authors have highlighted the importance of predicting people's health costs to improve healthcare budget management, most of them do not address the frequent need to know the reasons behind this prediction, i.e., knowing the factors that influence this prediction. This knowledge allows avoiding arbitrariness or people's discrimination. However, many times the black box methods (that is, those that do not allow this analysis, e.g., methods based on deep learning techniques) are more accurate than those that allow an interpretation of the results. For this reason, in this work, we intend to develop a method that can achieve similar returns as those obtained with black box methods for the problem of predicting health costs, but at the same time it allows the interpretation of the results. This interpretable regression method is based on the Dempster-Shafer theory using Evidential Regression (EVREG) and a discount function based on the contribution of each dimension. The method "learns" the optimal weights for each feature using a gradient descent technique. The method also uses the nearest k-neighbor algorithm to accelerate calculations. It is possible to select the most relevant features for predicting a patient's health care costs using this approach and the transparency of the Evidential Regression model. We can obtain a reason for a prediction with a k-NN approach. We used the Japanese health records at Tsuyama Chuo Hospital to test our method, which included medical examinations, test results, and billing information from 2013 to 2018. We compared our model to methods based on an Artificial Neural Network, Gradient Boosting, Regression Tree and Weighted k-Nearest Neighbors. Our results showed that our transparent model performed like the Artificial Neural Network and Gradient Boosting with an R-2 of 0.44.

AB  - Recent advances in prototypical learning have shown remarkable potential to provide useful decision interpretations associating activation maps and predictions with class-specific training prototypes. Such prototypical learning has been well-studied for various single-label diseases, but for quite relevant and more challenging multi-label diagnosis, where multiple diseases are often concurrent within an image, existing prototypical learning models struggle to obtain meaningful activation maps and effective class prototypes due to the entanglement of the multiple diseases. In this paper, we present a novel Cross- and Intra-image Prototypical Learning (CIPL) framework, for accurate multi-label disease diagnosis and interpretation from medical images. CIPL takes advantage of common cross-image semantics to disentangle the multiple diseases when learning the prototypes, allowing a comprehensive understanding of complicated pathological lesions. Furthermore, we propose a new two-level alignment-based regularisation strategy that effectively leverages consistent intra-image information to enhance interpretation robustness and predictive performance. Extensive experiments show that our CIPL attains the state-of-the-art (SOTA) classification accuracy in two public multi-label benchmarks of disease diagnosis: thoracic radiography and fundus images. Quantitative interpretability results show that CIPL also has superiority in weakly-supervised thoracic disease localisation over other leading saliency- and prototype-based explanation methods.

AB  - Attributed networks are prevalent in the current information infrastructure, where node attributes enhance knowledge discovery. Anomaly detection in attributed networks is gaining attention for its potential uses in cybersecurity, finance, and healthcare. Recognizing the complicated relationship between node attributes and network topology is crucial for attributed network embedding and anomaly detection. Nevertheless, there are few approaches available to directly represent the relationship between these two perspectives of the node property and the network topology. Approaches utilizing the reconstruction error rely on straightforward, simple mappings, which introduce a substantial risk of overfitting in high-dimensional data, wherein the model acquires patterns that are exclusive to the training data and fails to generalize to new data. To do this, we suggest a new way to find graph anomalies on attributed networks using random masking and padding along with sparse canonical correlation analysis. Motivated by the limitations of existing methodologies in effectively addressing these challenges, our research introduces a novel methodology for anomaly detection in attributed networks by leveraging Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis (SCCA) in conjunction with Random Masking and Padding (RMP). This dual approach uniquely addresses the challenges of high-dimensional data and the sparsity of attributes, which are prevalent issues in anomaly detection. Unlike previous works that primarily focus on either dimensionality reduction or attribute sparsity independently, our method synergizes these aspects to enhance detection performance. Initially, we randomly mask and pad nodes in the attributed network and use the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to map them to latent space. Next, we optimize the distribution alignment of node attributes and graph structure latent space representations by using Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence regularization, which increases their comparability. Finally, we use sparse canonical correlation analysis (SCCA) to quantify the correlation between node attributes and network structure views in latent space. SCCA incorporates sparsity by making the model choose fewer variables, which adds another level of complexity. It improves interpretability and reduces overfitting in high-dimensional data analysis by highlighting only the key variables. To optimize our model, we maximize the correlation between attribute and structural aspects of normal nodes, and anomalies are detected by measuring the correlation between these two views. Our approach is the first of its kind to provide a novel remedy to the fundamental problems preventing efficient and accurate anomaly identification, thereby establishing a new standard in this field. The proposed model has been extensively tested on four real-world datasets, and its effectiveness has been demonstrated in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches. The empirical evaluation across multiple benchmark datasets validates the potential of the proposed approach as a pivotal tool in advancing anomaly detection research and applications.

AB  - Simultaneously accurate and reliable tracking control for quadrotors in complex dynamic environments is challenging. The chaotic nature of aerodynamics, derived from drag forces and moment variations, makes precise identification difficult. Consequently, many existing quadrotor tracking systems treat these aerodynamic effects as simple 'disturbances' in conventional control approaches. We propose a novel and interpretable trajectory tracker integrating a distributional Reinforcement Learning (RL) disturbance estimator for unknown aerodynamic effects with a Stochastic Model Predictive Controller (SMPC). Specifically, the proposed estimator 'Constrained Distributional REinforced-Disturbance-estimator' (ConsDRED) effectively identifies uncertainties between the true and estimated values of aerodynamic effects. Control parameterization employs simplified affine disturbance feedback to ensure convexity, which is seamlessly integrated with the SMPC. We theoretically guarantee that ConsDRED achieves an optimal global convergence rate, and sublinear rates if constraints are violated with certain error decreases as neural network dimensions increase. To demonstrate practicality, we show convergent training, in simulation and real-world experiments, and empirically verify that ConsDRED is less sensitive to hyperparameter settings compared with canonical constrained RL. Our system substantially improves accumulative tracking errors by at least 70%, compared with the recent art. Importantly, the proposed ConsDRED-SMPC framework balances the trade-off between pursuing high performance and obeying conservative constraints for practical implementations. Note to Practitioners-This work is motivated by challenges in training Reinforcement Learning (RL) for autonomous navigation in unmanned aerial vehicles, but its implications extend to other high-criticality applications in, for example, healthcare and financial services. The implementation of RL algorithm policies may exhibit various deficiencies, including (i) opaque or unstable training due to the blackbox nature of deep neural networks, (ii) difficulty in reproducing RL outcomes, and (iii) heightened costs associated with robustness investigation, e.g., hyperparameter tuning and generalization. We present a novel 'Constrained Distributional REinforced-Disturbance-estimator' (ConsDRED) to identify uncertainties arising from aerodynamic disturbances in agile flight. The proposed algorithm demonstrates at least an optimal convergence rate for both global optimization and constraint violations. Theoretical guarantees offered by this approach can make training convergence processes more transparent and provide a degree of confidence in the expected convergence outcomes in real-world applications, thereby addressing, to a considerable extent, the deficiencies related to (i) and (ii). Our robustness investigation, related to (iii), empirically demonstrates that ConsDRED is significantly less sensitive to hyperparameter settings compared to traditional constrained RL approaches. The experiments further showcase the generalization capability of ConsDRED by introducing new and previously unseen external forces in real-world scenarios. While ConsDRED strikes a reasonable balance between performance and interpretability, there remains a trade-off with conservative decision-making. Hence, we must strike a balance between the desired degree of interpretability and the acceptable level of scalability in RL algorithms.
   Our proposed flight control framework evidences such a balance between high performance and safety constraints. A fundamental limitation is the computational complexity, where we sample at 16 Hz for disturbance estimation owing to limited onboard computational resources. This may be improved in the future by implementing dedicated hardware.

TI  - The clinician-AI interface: intended use and explainability in FDA-cleared AI devices for medical image interpretation
T2  - NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE
LA  - English
AB  - As applications of AI in medicine continue to expand, there is an increasing focus on integration into clinical practice. An underappreciated aspect of this clinical translation is where the AI fits into the clinical workflow, and in turn, the outputs generated by the AI to facilitate clinician interaction in this workflow. For instance, in the canonical use case of AI for medical image interpretation, the AI could prioritize cases before clinician review or even autonomously interpret the images without clinician review. A related aspect is explainability - does the AI generate outputs to help explain its predictions to clinicians? While many clinical AI workflows and explainability techniques have been proposed, a summative assessment of the current scope in clinical practice is lacking. Here, we evaluate the current state of FDA-cleared AI devices for medical image interpretation assistance in terms of intended clinical use, outputs generated, and types of explainability offered. We create a curated database focused on these aspects of the clinician-AI interface, where we find a high frequency of "triage" devices, notable variability in output characteristics across products, and often limited explainability of AI predictions. Altogether, we aim to increase transparency of the current landscape of the clinician-AI interface and highlight the need to rigorously assess which strategies ultimately lead to the best clinical outcomes.

AB  - Background: In the field of medical imaging, the rapid rise of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has presented significant opportunities for conserving healthcare resources. However, with the wide spread application of CNNs, several challenges have emerged, such as enormous data annotation costs, difficulties in ensuring user privacy and security, weak model interpretability, and the consumption of substantial computational resources. The fundamental challenge lies in optimizing and seamlessly integrating CNN technology to enhance the precision and efficiency of medical diagnosis. Methods: This study sought to provide a comprehensive bibliometric overview of current research on the application of CNNs in medical imaging. Initially, bibliometric methods were used to calculate the frequency statistics, and perform the cluster analysis and the co -citation analysis of countries, institutions, authors, keywords, and references. Subsequently, the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) method was employed for the topic modeling of the literature. Next, an in-depth analysis of the topics was conducted, and the topics in the medical field, technical aspects, and trends in topic evolution were summarized. Finally, by integrating the bibliometrics and LDA results, the developmental trajectory, milestones, and future directions in this field were outlined. Results: A data set containing 6,310 articles in this field published from January 2013 to December 2023 was complied. With a total of 55,538 articles, the United States led in terms of the citation count, while in terms of the publication volume, China led with 2,385 articles. Harvard University emerged as the most influential institution, boasting an average of 69.92 citations per article. Within the realm of CNNs, residual neural network (ResNet) and U -Net stood out, receiving 1,602 and 1,419 citations, respectively, which highlights the significant attention these models have received. The impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was unmistakable, as reflected by the publication of 597 articles, making it a focal point of research. Additionally, among various disease topics, with 290 articles, brain -related research was the most prevalent. Computed tomography (CT) imaging dominated the research landscape, representing 73% of the 30 different topics. Conclusions: Over the past 11 years, CNN -related research in medical imaging has grown exponentially. The findings of the present study provide insights into the field's status and research hotspots.

AB  - Weighted Fuzzy Production Rules (WFPRs) are vital for Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSSs), significantly impacting diagnostic accuracy and bridging the gap between data-driven insights and actionable clinical decisions through knowledge engineering. This paper proposes an integrated approach combining the Dynamic Dimension Adjustment Harmony Search (DDA-HS) Algorithm and Back Propagation Neural Networks (BPNNs) to enhance WFPR extraction accuracy. DDA-HS dynamically adjusts search space dimensions through fitness evaluations, optimizing initial weights in BPNNs and leveraging an absorbing Markov chain to enhance transition probabilities, supporting exploration and avoiding local optima in high-dimensional spaces. Evaluated against existing optimization methods including Harmony Search (HS), Cuckoo Search (CS), Adaptive Global Optimal Harmony Search (AGOHS), and Harmony Search with Cuckoo Search (HSCS) Algorithms, DDA-HS achieves 74.48% accuracy for BPNN classification and 77.08% for WFPR classification on the PIMA dataset, representing improvements of 3.6% and 6.5%, respectively. WFPR extraction enhances BPNN interpretability by revealing feature influences on decision-making, improving both accuracy and transparency. The proposed method offers a robust framework for reliable and interpretable CDSSs in healthcare.

AB  - Integrating multi-omics data into predictive models has the potential to enhance accuracy, which is essential for precision medicine. In this study, we developed interpretable predictive models for multi-omics data by employing neural networks informed by prior biological knowledge, referred to as visible networks. These neural networks offer insights into the decision-making process and can unveil novel perspectives on the underlying biological mechanisms associated with traits and complex diseases. We tested the performance, interpretability and generalizability for inferring smoking status, subject age and LDL levels using genome-wide RNA expression and CpG methylation data from the blood of the BIOS consortium (four population cohorts, Ntotal = 2940). In a cohort-wise cross-validation setting, the consistency of the diagnostic performance and interpretation was assessed. Performance was consistently high for predicting smoking status with an overall mean AUC of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.90-1.00) and interpretation revealed the involvement of well-replicated genes such as AHRR, GPR15 and LRRN3. LDL-level predictions were only generalized in a single cohort with an R2 of 0.07 (95% CI: 0.05-0.08). Age was inferred with a mean error of 5.16 (95% CI: 3.97-6.35) years with the genes COL11A2, AFAP1, OTUD7A, PTPRN2, ADARB2 and CD34 consistently predictive. For both regression tasks, we found that using multi-omics networks improved performance, stability and generalizability compared to interpretable single omic networks. We believe that visible neural networks have great potential for multi-omics analysis; they combine multi-omic data elegantly, are interpretable, and generalize well to data from different cohorts.

AB  - Medical image analysis plays a crucial role in modern healthcare for accurate diagnosis and treatment. However, the inherent challenges and limitations posed by the complexity and variability of medical images, coupled with the shortcomings of existing methods, necessitate the development of novel approaches. In this study, we propose LiteFusionNet (Lightweight Fusion Network), a lightweight model that effectively addresses these challenges, offering the advantage of accurate and efficient medical image classification while mitigating the computational demands. The LitefusionNet leverages the power of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and feature fusion techniques to achieve improved performance in medical image classification. LitefusionNet combines the strengths of MobileNet and MobileNetV2 architectures to extract robust features from medical images. These features capture discriminative information from different levels of abstraction, enhancing the model 's ability to capture fine-grained patterns. The fusion process employs a concatenation method to combine the extracted features, resulting in a more comprehensive representation that improves the model 's classification accuracy. To evaluate the effectiveness of LitefusionNet, extensive experiments are conducted on a diverse set of publicly available medical image datasets, including brain MRI, skin, CT, X-ray, and histology. The results demonstrate that LitefusionNet outperforms several existing models in terms of classification accuracy, showcasing its efficacy in different medical imaging modalities. Furthermore, we provide interpretability to the model 's predictions by performing Grad -CAM analysis, enabling insights into the important regions in the medical images that contribute to the classification decision. In addition, we compare LitefusionNet with five pre -trained models. LiteFusionNet excels in medical image classification, boasting impressive accuracies across diverse datasets: 97.33% for brain MRI, 91.11% for skin, 99.00% for CT, 98.15% for X-ray, and 92.11% for histology. These results underscore LiteFusionNet 's robust and versatile performance, making it a compelling solution for accurate and efficient medical image analysis. Overall, LitefusionNet strikes a balance between accuracy, efficiency, and real-time performance. Our findings demonstrate its potential as a promising solution for accurate and efficient medical image analysis, with applications in diagnostic support systems and clinical decision -making.

AB  - Accidental falls pose a significant public health challenge, especially among vulnerable populations. To address this issue, comprehensive research on fall detection and rescue systems is essential. Vision-based technologies, with their promising potential, offer an effective means to detect falls. This research paper presents a cuttingedge fall detection methodology aimed at enhancing individual safety and well-being. The proposed methodology utilizes deep neural networks, leveraging their capabilities to drive advancements in fall detection. To overcome data limitations and computational efficiency concerns, this study employ transfer learning by finetuning pre-trained models on large-scale image datasets for fall detection. This approach significantly enhances model performance, enabling better generalization and accuracy, especially in real-time applications with constrained resources. Notably, the methodology achieved an impressive test accuracy of 98.15%. Additionally, the incorporation of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques is used to ensure transparent and trustworthy decision-making in fall detection using deep learning models, especially in critical healthcare contexts for vulnerable individuals. XAI provides valuable insights into complex model architectures and parameters, enabling a deeper understanding of fall identification patterns. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, a rigorous experimentation was conducted using a diverse dataset containing real-world fall and nonfall scenarios. The results demonstrate substantial improvements in both accuracy and interpretability, confirming the superiority of this method over conventional fall detection approaches.

AB  - Data mining is the most widely used method for discovering knowledge. There are numerous data mining tasks, with classification being the most frequently encountered task in various application domains such as fraud detection, disease diagnosis, text classification, and so on. Many classification techniques, such as Bayesian classifiers, decision trees, genetic algorithms, neural networks (NNs), and so on, are available to help researchers solve problems in a variety of domains. However, NNs are the most frequently used classification approach because they are effective at solving classification problems that cannot be divided into linear and non-linear categories, have high classification accuracy on large datasets, and require minimal processing effort. Despite having good classification performances, NNs have a pitfall associated with them which hinders their applicability in some real-world applications. NNs are black boxes in nature, which means they cannot make transparent decisions that humans can interpret. Because of this limitation, NNs are unsuitable for many applications that require transparency in decision-making as well as high accuracy, such as audit mining or medical diagnosis. The well-known solution to this inherent disadvantage of NNs is to extract explainable decision rules from them. The extracted rules provide a detailed understanding of how NNs work in a human-readable format. Rule extraction is a well-established technique with a plethora of literature on the subject. However, there are very few papers whose primary goal is to survey the existing literature. As a result, the goal of this work is to provide a detailed analysis of the existing literature and to create a framework for existing and new researchers to conduct research in this field. The paper examines the state-of art from the perspective of designing framework of the algorithms, evaluation criteria, and applications.

AB  - Deep neural networks must address the dual challenge of delivering high-accuracy predictions and providing user-friendly explanations. While deep models are widely used in the field of time series modeling, deciphering the core principles that govern the models' outputs remains a significant challenge. This is crucial for fostering the development of trusted models and facilitating domain expert validation, thereby empowering users and domain experts to utilize them confidently in high-risk decision-making contexts (e.g., decision-support systems in healthcare). In this work, we put forward a deep prototype learning model that supports interpretable and manipulable modeling and classification of medical time series (i.e., ECG signal). Specifically, we first optimize the representation of single heartbeat data by employing a bidirectional long short-term memory and attention mechanism, and then construct prototypes during the training phase. The final classification outcomes (i.e., normal sinus rhythm, atrial fibrillation, and other rhythm) are determined by comparing the input with the obtained prototypes. Moreover, the proposed model presents a human-machine collaboration mechanism, allowing domain experts to refine the prototypes by integrating their expertise to further enhance the model's performance (contrary to the human-in-the-loop paradigm, where humans primarily act as supervisors or correctors, intervening when required, our approach focuses on a human-machine collaboration, wherein both parties engage as partners, enabling more fluid and integrated interactions). The experimental outcomes presented herein delineate that, within the realm of binary classification tasks-specifically distinguishing between normal sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation-our proposed model, albeit registering marginally lower performance in comparison to certain established baseline models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and bidirectional long short-term memory with attention mechanisms (Bi-LSTMAttns), evidently surpasses other contemporary state-of-the-art prototype baseline models. Moreover, it demonstrates significantly enhanced performance relative to these prototype baseline models in the context of triple classification tasks, which encompass normal sinus rhythm, atrial fibrillation, and other rhythm classifications. The proposed model manifests a commendable prediction accuracy of 0.8414, coupled with macro precision, recall, and F1-score metrics of 0.8449, 0.8224, and 0.8235, respectively, achieving both high classification accuracy as well as good interpretability.

AB  - 6G is envisioned as the next generation of wireless communication technology, promising unprecedented data speeds, ultra -low Latency, and ubiquitous Connectivity. In tandem with these advancements, blockchain technology is leveraged to enhance computer vision applications' security, trustworthiness, and transparency. With the widespread use of mobile devices equipped with cameras, the ability to capture and recognize Chinese characters in natural scenes has become increasingly important. Blockchain can facilitate privacy -preserving mechanisms in applications where privacy is paramount, such as facial recognition or personal healthcare monitoring. Users can control their visual data and grant or revoke access as needed. Recognizing Chinese characters from images can provide convenience in various aspects of people's lives. However, traditional Chinese character text recognition methods often need higher accuracy, leading to recognition failures or incorrect character identification. In contrast, computer vision technologies have significantly improved image recognition accuracy. This paper proposed a Secure end -to -end recognition system (SE2ERS) for Chinese characters in natural scenes based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) using 6G technology. The proposed SE2ERS model uses the Weighted Hyperbolic Curve Cryptograph (WHCC) of the secure data transmission in the 6G network with the blockchain model. The data transmission within the computer vision system, with a 6G gradient directional histogram (GDH), is employed for character estimation. With the deployment of WHCC and GDH in the constructed SE2ERS model, secure communication is achieved for the data transmission with the 6G network. The proposed SE2ERS compares the performance of traditional Chinese text recognition methods and data transmission environment with 6G communication. Experimental results demonstrate that SE2ERS achieves an average recognition accuracy of 88% for simple Chinese characters, compared to 81.2% with traditional methods. For complex Chinese characters, the average recognition accuracy improves to 84.4% with our system, compared to 72.8% with traditional methods. Additionally, deploying the WHCC model improves data security with the increased data encryption rate complexity of similar to 12 & higher than the traditional techniques.

AB  - Eye diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic retinopathy are common worldwide and affect millions of people. These conditions can cause severe vision problems and even lead to blindness if not treated promptly. Therefore, accurate and timely diagnosis is crucial to manage these diseases effectively and prevent irreversible vision loss. This study introduces a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) framework for automatically detecting various eye diseases via advanced methodologies and datasets. The main focus is on classifying fundus images, which is essential for precise diagnosis and prognosis. By incorporating cutting-edge techniques such as Vision Transformers (ViTs), this study aims to improve the performance and interpretability of traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). ViTs can capture complex patterns and long-range dependencies in fundus images, helping distinguish between different eye diseases and healthy conditions. Furthermore, the study integrates SHapley additive exPlanations (SHAP) explainability techniques to provide insights into the model's decision-making process, enhancing trust and understanding of its predictions. The results demonstrate significant performance enhancements compared with the baseline models, with an overall accuracy of 95%. This method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by a considerable margin. Additionally, metrics such as precision, recall, intersection over union (IoU), and the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) show superior performance across various eye diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration. These findings underscore the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed approach in automated eye disease detection, indicating its potential for clinical integration and widespread adoption in healthcare settings.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the critical necessity for robust and accurate predictive frameworks to bolster global healthcare infrastructures. This study presents a comprehensive examination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) applied to the prediction of COVID-19-related health outcomes, with an emphasis on core challenges, methodological constraints, and potential remediation strategies. Our investigation targets two principal aims: the identification of COVID-19 infections through chest radiographic imaging, specifically X-rays, and the prognostication of disease severity by integrating clinical parameters and electronic health records. Utilizing a multidimensional dataset encompassing demographic, clinical, and radiological information, we evaluated the efficacy of CNN architectures in forecasting patient prognoses. The CNN model attained an accuracy of 97.2%, reflecting its capability while simultaneously revealing significant challenges, including limited and imbalanced data, as well as difficulties in model interpretability. Principal limitations identified comprise overfitting, data heterogeneity, and the imperative for model adaptability amid evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants. To mitigate these issues, we propose strategies such as data augmentation, transfer learning, ensemble modeling, and enhancements in explainability, which collectively demonstrated improvements in predictive performance and theoretical robustness. This work highlights the imperative for continuous model refinement and the integration of domain-specific expertise to elevate the reliability and applicability of CNN-based prognostic tools for COVID-19 healthcare analytics. Our empirical results indicate that the CNN achieved a precision of 96.8%, an F1-score of 97.2%, and an AUC-ROC of 0.987, underscoring its effectiveness in detecting and classifying COVID-19 cases. These insights provide valuable directions for researchers and clinicians, fostering data-driven approaches in the management and prediction of COVID-19 health outcomes.

AB  - Electronic Health Records (EHRs) serve as a comprehensive repository of multimodal patient health data, combining static demographic attributes with dynamic, irregular Multivariate Time Series (MTS), characterized by varying lengths. While MTS provide critical insights for clinical predictions, their integration with static features enables a more nuanced understanding of patient health trajectories and enhances predictive accuracy. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have proven highly effective in capturing complex patterns in healthcare data, offering a framework for multimodal data fusion. However, their adoption in clinical practice is limited by a lack of interpretability, as transparency and explainability are essential for supporting informed medical decisions. This study presents interpretable multimodal DNN architectures for predicting and understanding the emergence of Multidrug Resistance (MDR) in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). The proposed models integrate static demographic data with temporal variables, providing a holistic view of baseline patient characteristics and health progression. To address predictive performance and interpretability challenges, we introduce a novel methodology combining feature selection techniques with attention mechanisms and post-hoc explainability tools. This approach not only reduces feature redundancy but also highlights key risk factors, thereby improving model accuracy and robustness. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, achieving a Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve of 76.90 +/- 3.10, a significant improvement over baseline models. Beyond MDR prediction, this methodology offers a scalable and interpretable framework for addressing various clinical challenges involving EHR data. By integrating predictive accuracy with explanatory insights-such as the identification of key risk factors-this work supports timely, evidence-based interventions to improve patient outcomes in ICU settings.

AB  - Glaucoma is defined as progressive optic neuropathy that damages the structural appearance of the optic nerve head and is characterized by permanent blindness. For mass fundus image-based glaucoma classification, an improved automated computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) model performing binary classification (glaucoma or healthy), allowing ophthalmologists to detect glaucoma disease correctly in less computational time. We proposed learning technique called fast discrete curvelet transform with wrapping (FDCT-WRP) to create feature set. This method is entitled extracting curve-like features and creating a feature set. The combined feature reduction techniques named as principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis, have been applied to generate prominent features and decrease the feature vector dimension. Lastly, a newly improved learning algorithm encompasses a modified pelican optimization algorithm (MOD-POA) and an extreme learning machine (ELM) for classification tasks. In this MOD-POA+ELM algorithm, the modified pelican optimization algorithm (MOD-POA) has been utilized to optimize the parameters of ELM's hidden neurons. The effectiveness has been evaluated using two standard datasets called G1020 and ORIGA with the \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$10 \times 5$$\end{document}-fold stratified cross-validation technique to ensure reliable evaluation. Our employed scheme achieved the best results for both datasets obtaining accuracy of 93.25% (G1020 dataset) and 96.75% (ORIGA dataset), respectively. Furthermore, we have utilized seven Explainable AI methodologies: Vanilla Gradients (VG), Guided Backpropagation (GBP ), Integrated Gradients ( IG), Guided Integrated Gradients (GIG), SmoothGrad, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (GCAM), and Guided Grad-CAM (GGCAM) for interpretability examination, aiding in the advancement of dependable and credible automation of healthcare detection of glaucoma.

AB  - The intricacies of cancer present formidable challenges in achieving effective treatments. Despite extensive research in computational methods for drug response prediction, achieving personalized treatment insights remains challenging. Emerging solutions combine multiple omics data, leveraging graph neural networks to integrate molecular interactions into the reasoning process. However, effectively modeling and harnessing this information, as well as gaining the trust of clinical professionals remain complex. This paper introduces ExplainMIX, a pioneering approach that utilizes directed graph neural networks to predict drug responses with interpretability. ExplainMIX adeptly captures intricate structures and features within directed heterogeneous graphs, leveraging diverse data modalities such as genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. ExplainMIX goes beyond prediction by generating transparent and interpretable explanations. Incorporating edge-level, meta-path, and graph structure information, it provides meaningful insights into factors influencing drug response, supporting clinicians and researchers in the development of targeted therapies. Empirical results validate the efficacy of ExplainMIX in prediction and interpretation tasks by constructing a quantitative evaluation ground truth. This approach aims to contribute to precision medicine research by addressing challenges in interpretable personalized drug response prediction within the landscape of cancer.

AB  - This study presents an interpretable AI-assisted diagnostic approach for papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) cytopathology by combining graph neural networks (GNNs) with knowledge graphs (KGs). Routine cytology smears from 281 PTC cases were scanned, labeled, and processed using the Cascade RCNN model to detect pathological cell features, including 45,680 ground-glass nuclei, 712 nuclear grooves, and 116 intranuclear inclusions. By integrating GNNs, the model achieved a mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 56.14% and a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.87. The GINet model further improved classification accuracy to 88.84%. Our approach also incorporates a clinical decision support system (CDSS) for querying KGs, providing explainable diagnostic outputs. This method offers an interpretable and reliable AI tool for PTC diagnosis, enhancing the transparency of AI-assisted pathology systems.

AB  - Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), offering superior accuracy and interpretability, which are two critical requirements in healthcare applications. This study investigates the effectiveness of KANs across a range of clinical tasks by applying them to diverse medical datasets, including structured clinical data and time-series physiological signals. Compared with conventional ANNs, KANs demonstrate significantly improved performance, achieving higher predictive accuracy even with smaller network architectures. Beyond performance gains, KANs offer a unique advantage: the ability to extract symbolic expressions from learned functions, enabling transparent, human-interpretable models-a key factor in clinical decision-making. Through comprehensive experiments and symbolic analysis, our results reveal that KANs not only outperform ANNs in modeling complex healthcare data but also provide interpretable insights that can support personalized medicine and early diagnosis. There is nothing specific about the datasets or the methods employed, so the findings are broadly applicable and position KANs as a compelling architecture for the future of AI in healthcare.

AB  - Cardiac arrhythmia (ARR) is a major contributor to cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related fatalities worldwide. Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals play a crucial role in diagnosing and monitoring various cardiac conditions in patients. Over the past decade, convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have made substantial progress in arrhythmia detection research. However, their lack of interpretability and limited adaptability across different domains have hindered their practical application, especially in healthcare, where accurate diagnosis is of utmost importance. To address these limitations, an interpretable domain-generalization diagnostic model based on the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) is explored. Since the CNN architecture shares similarities with WST, our study involves a comprehensive analysis and comparison of both models for arrhythmia beat classification, an aspect that has not been extensively explored in the existing literature. Additionally, we propose a new model resembling the WST to achieve a more interpretable variant of convolutional neural architecture. This new model combines the domain-knowledge-based hand-crafted structure of WST with automatic database-dependent learning of neural network and provides further insight into the signal characteristics relevant to disease classification. The employed architectures were tested using the publicly available Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Beth Israel Hospital (MIT-BIH) arrhythmia database. Our frameworks yielded comparable results to some of the state-of-the-art classification techniques while demanding less computation in terms of space complexity. Furthermore, combining features from both models led to improved classification performance, proving their complementarity. Notably, these models also emphasize their ability to provide a physiologically interpretable understanding of abnormal heart rhythms.

AB  - Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Dementia represent critical healthcare challenges worldwide, underscoring the need for reliable and early diagnostic tools. This study presents an innovative classification framework that combines the strengths of fuzzy logic and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to enhance the detection of AD and dementia. Leveraging Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, a non-invasive and informative modality reflecting cognitive function, we propose a Fuzzy RNN model that integrates the sequential learning capabilities of RNNs with the interpretability and uncertainty handling of fuzzy logic. The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset comprising EEG recordings from individuals with Alzheimer's Disease, various types of dementia, and healthy controls. Evaluation metrics, including sensitivity (96.49%-97.19%), specificity (96.72%-97.85%), and accuracy (97.82%-98.82%), highlight the model's robustness in differentiating between diagnostic categories. Comparative analyses against traditional classifiers demonstrate the Fuzzy RNN's superior ability to capture intricate temporal patterns in EEG signals, establishing its potential as a reliable tool for early and accurate dementia diagnosis.

AB  - In applications such as healthcare, finance, and environmental monitoring, the demand for more reliable time-series prediction models has grown critical. Traditional models, such as VARMAx, struggle with capturing non-linear and complex dependencies inherent in sequential data. To address these challenges, this work proposes a hybrid model combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and incorporating attention mechanisms for improved precision and interpretability. LSTM networks are utilized to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data, while CNNs are employed to extract significant local features. The attention mechanism enhances the model's focus on critical time-series instances, improving prediction accuracy and interpretability. Additionally, hyperparameter optimization is achieved using metaheuristic approaches such as the grey wolf optimizer and the coot optimization algorithm, ensuring maximum performance. The model integrates multimodal LSTMs to handle diverse data types, such as text and images, while preserving relationships between entities using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Adaptive feedback learning, combining reinforcement and federated learning, allows for real-time model adaptability while maintaining data privacy. Bayesian neural networks with dropout regularization provide uncertainty estimation, delivering confidence intervals alongside predictions. The proposed hybrid model demonstrates a 6-8% absolute improvement in predictive accuracy, reduced RMSE, and enhanced interpretability compared to traditional benchmarks. Its effectiveness is particularly evident in scenarios with high uncertainty, complex data, and the need for real-time model adaptation, setting a new standard in time-series prediction.

AB  - Hair artifacts in dermoscopic images significantly hinder the accurate diagnosis of melanoma and other skin conditions by obscuring critical lesion details. To address this challenge, we introduce DPA-HairNet, a novel Dual Encoder Attention-Based Network designed specifically for effective hair artifact removal while preserving lesion integrity. The model features a dual encoder architecture to separately process hair-specific and lesion-specific features, an attention mechanism to prioritize diagnostically relevant regions, and a dual-output design that generates precise hair segmentation masks and high-quality reconstructed images. This study leverages the ISIC 2018 and HAM10000 datasets, incorporating advanced data augmentation techniques to enhance dataset diversity and ensure robust model training. DPA-HairNet was evaluated against six state-of-the-art segmentation models using comprehensive metrics, including Accuracy, Dice Coefficient, Jaccard Index, PSNR, MAE, Specificity, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, where the proposed model outperformed all models. Furthermore, classification performance was assessed before and after hair artifact removal using twelve pre-trained classifiers, demonstrating significant improvements in diagnostic accuracy. Explainable AI techniques, Grad-CAM, UMAP and attention heatmaps, were employed to interpret and validate the model's focus. These results underscore DPA-HairNet's effectiveness and potential integration into clinical workflows to enhance dermoscopic image analysis and diagnosis. Future work will explore generalization to additional artifact types and optimization for real-time clinical deployment.

AB  - Introduction Monitoring cardiovascular health in autistic patients presents unique challenges due to atypical sensory profiles, altered autonomic regulation, and communication difficulties. As cardiovascular comorbidities rise in this population, there is an urgent need for tailored computational strategies to enable continuous monitoring and predictive care planning. Traditional time series methods-including statistical autoregressive models and recurrent neural networks-are constrained by opaque decision processes, limited personalization, and insufficient handling of multimodal data, restricting their utility where transparency and individualized modeling are critical.Methods We introduce a structurally-aware, semantically-grounded framework for time series prediction tailored to cardiovascular trajectories in autistic patients. Our approach departs from black-box modeling by integrating symbolic clinical abstractions, causal event dynamics, and intervention-response coupling within a graph-based paradigm. Central to our method is the CardioGraph Synaptic Encoder (CGSE), a generative model that fuses multimodal data-such as ECG waveforms, blood pressure signals, and structured clinical annotations-into a unified latent space. The CGSE employs dual-level temporal attention to capture patient-specific micro-patterns and population-level structures. To improve generalization and robustness, we propose the Dynamic Cardiovascular Trajectory Alignment (DCTA), which combines task-adaptive curriculum learning with multi-resolution consistency loss.Results Our approach effectively addresses challenges such as scarcity of labeled data and clinical heterogeneity common in autistic populations. Experimental results demonstrate that our system significantly outperforms baselines in predictive accuracy, temporal coherence, and interpretability.Discussion This work offers a novel, clinically-aligned pipeline for real-time cardiovascular risk monitoring in autistic individuals. By advancing personalized and interpretable healthcare analytics, our method has the potential to support more accurate and transparent decision-making in cardiovascular care pathways for this vulnerable population.

AB  - Dementia is a growing global health concern that significantly impacts the quality of life for millions of individuals and imposes substantial burdens on healthcare systems. Early detection and accurate diagnosis are crucial for effective dementia management. Electroencephalography (EEG) has emerged as a non-invasive tool for identifying dementia-related abnormalities and assessing brain function. However, existing EEG-based methods often fail to pinpoint specific biomarkers, particularly brain lobe changes. Brain lobe analysis in EEG is essential for advancing dementia detection and improving diagnostic accuracy. This study aims to address this gap by exploring key brain lobes involved in dementia detection and classification, focusing on Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Frontotemporal dementia (FTD). We introduce a Short-Time Fourier Transform to generate spectrogram images from EEG signals combined with Convolutional Neural Networks to identify the most critical brain lobes for enhanced dementia detection. We have applied Grad-CAM method to improve result interpretability and offer meaningful insights to the research community. Our experiments on OpenNeuro ds004504 EEG dataset for AD and FTD indicate that the parietal lobe exhibits the most significant changes in both conditions, achieving 95.72% accuracy for FTD and 92.25% for AD, followed by the temporal and frontal lobes. When applying the proposed framework to the entire brain region, we achieved 95.59% accuracy for AD and 93.14% for FTD. The findings from EEG-based brain lobe analysis aid experts in improving diagnostic and monitoring tools for neurodegenerative disorders, thereby advancing the understanding and clinical management of dementias like AD and FTD.

AB  - Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is crucial in fields like healthcare and education, requiring robust techniques for accurate emotion detection. This paper proposes a deep neuro-fuzzy framework combining Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS). It includes fuzzification, deep feature extraction, and defuzzification units, enhancing SER accuracy while addressing ANFIS limitations with high-dimensional data and DNN's lack of interpretability. The scheme's productivity on three standard speech databases is appraised: RML, SAVEE, and RAVDESS. The results indicate that our framework outperforms ANFIS, DNN, and pre-trained models, achieving up to 97.95% accuracy and showing strong potential for future SER research.

AB  - Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) significantly impacts global health, impairing individual functioning and increasing socioeconomic burden. Developing innovative, interpretable approaches for its identification is essential for improving diagnosis and guiding treatment. This study introduces a novel framework designed to classify MDD using resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data. Our framework follows three stages: First, Node2Vec extracts rich, low-dimensional brain region embeddings from functional connectivity (FC) networks, capturing their complex topological information. Second, these informative embeddings feed a Graph Attention Network (GAT) which, via multi-head attention, identifies and weighs discriminative inter-regional functional connections, refining them into a potent graph representation. Third, these GAT-derived representations are classified by an ensemble classifier (Random Forest, SVM, MLP) for robust MDD identification. The model achieved classification accuracies of 78.73% and 92.94% on the REST-meta-MDD and SRPBS-MDD datasets, respectively. Moreover, the attention mechanism revealed that resting-state functional connectivity of regions within the Default Mode Network (DMN) and Frontoparietal Network (FPN) were among the most discriminative features for distinguishing MDD from healthy controls. The attention mechanism enhanced interpretability by highlighting significant brain regions linked to MDD. Compared to traditional methods, this GNN-based approach effectively captures complex brain connectivity patterns and offers improved interpretability, ultimately aiding healthcare professionals in diagnosing MDD more accurately.

AB  - Eye diseases (EDs), including glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and cataracts, are major contributors to vision loss and reduced quality of life worldwide. These conditions not only affect millions of individuals but also impose a significant burden on global healthcare systems. As the population ages and lifestyle changes increase the prevalence of conditions like diabetes, the incidence of EDs is expected to rise, further straining diagnostic and treatment resources. Timely and accurate diagnosis is critical for effective management and prevention of vision loss, as early intervention can significantly slow disease progression and improve patient outcomes. However, traditional diagnostic methods rely heavily on manual analysis of fundus imaging, which is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and subject to human error. This underscores the urgent need for automated, efficient, and accurate diagnostic systems that can handle the growing demand while maintaining high diagnostic standards. Current approaches, while advancing, still face challenges such as inefficiency, susceptibility to errors, and limited ability to detect subtle retinal asymmetries, which are critical early indicators of disease. Effective solutions must address these issues while ensuring high accuracy, interpretability, and scalability. This research introduces a 2D single-channel convolutional neural network (CNN) based on ResNet101-V2 architecture. The model integrates gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) to highlight retinal asymmetries linked to EDs, thereby enhancing interpretability and detection precision. Evaluated on retinal Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) datasets for multiclass classification tasks, the model demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving accuracy rates of 99.90% for four-class tasks and 99.27% for eight-class tasks. By leveraging patterns of retinal symmetry and asymmetry, the proposed model improves early detection and simplifies the diagnostic workflow, offering a promising advancement in the field of automated eye disease diagnosis.

AB  - We propose a nonparametric additive model for estimating interpretable value functions in reinforcement learning, with an application in optimizing postoperative recovery through personalized, adaptive recommendations. While reinforcement learning has achieved significant success in various domains, recent methods often rely on black-box approaches, such as neural networks, which hinder the examination of individual feature contributions to a decision-making policy. Our novel method offers a flexible technique for estimating action-value functions without explicit parametric assumptions, overcoming the limitations of the linearity assumption of classical algorithms. By incorporating local kernel regression and basis expansion, we obtain a sparse, additive representation of the action-value function, enabling local approximation and retrieval of nonlinear, independent contributions of select state features and the interactions between joint feature pairs. We validate our approach through a simulation study and apply it to spine disease recovery, uncovering recommendations aligned with clinical knowledge. This method bridges the gap between flexible machine learning techniques and the interpretability required in healthcare applications, paving the way for more personalized interventions.

AB  - Background Stroke-associated pneumonia (SAP) is a major cause of mortality following ischemic stroke (IS). However, existing predictive models for SAP often lack transparency and interpretability, limiting their clinical utility. This study aims to develop an interpretable Bayesian network (BN) model for predicting SAP in IS patients, focusing on enhancing both predictive accuracy and clinical interpretability.Methods This retrospective study included patients diagnosed with IS and admitted to the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University between January and December 2019. Clinical data collected within 48 h of admission and SAP occurrences within 7 days were analyzed. Dimensionality reduction was performed using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator regression, while data imbalances were addressed using synthetic minority oversampling technique. A BN model was trained using a hill-climbing algorithm and compared to logistic regression, decision trees, deep neural networks, and existing risk-scoring systems. Decision curve analysis was used to assess clinical usefulness.Results Of the 1252 patients, 165 (13.18%) patients had SAP within 7 days of admission. The BN model identified age, risk of pressure injury (PI), National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, and C-reactive protein (CRP) as significant prognostic factors. The BN model achieved an area under the curve of 0.85(95% CI: 0.78-0.92) on the test set, outperforming other models and demonstrating a greater net benefit in clinical decision-making.Conclusions Age, risk of PI, NIHSS score, and CRP are significant predictors of SAP in IS patients. The interpretable BN model demonstrates superior predictive performance and interpretability, suggesting its potential as an effective and interpretable tool for clinical decision support in SAP risk assessment.

AB  - Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders represent a significant challenge in healthcare, underscoring the necessity for more precise and effective diagnostic techniques. Conventional approaches, which often rely on single models, have demonstrated shortcomings in both accuracy and efficacy, often failing to detect the intricate and varied patterns linked to these diseases. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces a novel ensemble learning framework tailored for GI detection. The framework utilizes a three-layer architectural approach that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm (ACO), and Weighted Aggregation Ensemble Techniques (WAET). The methodology unfolds in three key stages: First, multiple CNNs are fine-tuned using transfer learning, while ACO optimizes the hyperparameters of each CNN to enhance model adaptability and performance. Second, the predictions from the top three optimized models are combined using WAET to strengthen the system's robustness in GI detection. Lastly, ACO is employed to optimize the weight assignment for each model during the ensembling process. We use a dataset of 6000 endoscopy images, enhanced by cropping and augmentation techniques to boost diversity and improve classification performance. Additional experiments on CP-Child-A and CP-Child-B show that the proposed ensemble model achieves superior performance, with an accuracy of 99.88% on the primary dataset and 98.75% and 100% on CP-Child-A and B, respectively. It outperforms traditional hybrid methods and state-of-the-art approaches. The effectiveness of the model is further validated through interpretability techniques like Grad-CAM and SHAP, providing insights into the decision-making process. This approach enhances diagnostic accuracy and provides a robust, interpretable solution for automated detection of GI diseases, improving clinical decision-making.

AB  - Deep neural networks achieve outstanding results in a large variety of tasks, often outperforming human experts. However, a known limitation of current neural architectures is the poor accessibility in understanding and interpreting the network's response to a given input. This is directly related to the huge number of variables and the associated non-linearities of neural models, which are often used as black boxes. This lack of transparency, particularly in crucial areas like autonomous driving, security, and healthcare, can trigger skepticism and limit trust, despite the networks' high performance. In this work, we want to advance the interpretability in neural networks. We present Agglomerator++, a framework capable of providing a representation of part-whole hierarchies from visual cues and organizing the input distribution to match the conceptual-semantic hierarchical structure between classes. We evaluate our method on common datasets, such as SmallNORB, MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, showing that our solution delivers amore interpretable model compared to other state-of-the-art approaches. Our code is available at https://mmlabcv.github.io/Agglomeratorplusplus/.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the modern medical industry, sensors and other medical electronic equipment such as ECG, thermometers, etc. that measure vitals like blood pressure, body temperature, heartbeat, and blood cells are used to record patient data. The information gathered helps to create a patient profile, which in turn helps doctors treat patients appropriately and helps users gain insights into their health. But, the information collected is regionally specific and not worldwide. Thus, this may create problems in transparency, integrity, and much more. The medical details of patients collected are stored in a simple database which appears to be a centralized application that is prone to be modified or hacked by intruders and also suffers from fault tolerance. OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to solve this problem using Blockchain and Data Possession methodologies. METHODS: Blockchain helps to store multiple copies of data in a decentralized fashion. Thus, a secured model could be implemented using blockchain in which the patient's data can be securely sent to any medical professional, thus promoting transparency, security, and integrity. RESULTS: Provable Data Possession helps the users to verify that their information is intact and has not been tampered. It can be achieved using cryptography which encrypts the information of the patients stored. CONCLUSION: This paper will be beneficial for the medical department and the public such that it will be beneficial in terms of transparency, scalability, and security.

AB  - In our previous study, we demonstrated the feasibility of producing a proactive statin prescription strategy - a personalized statin treatment plan (PSTP) - using neural networks with big data. However, its non-transparency limited result interpretations and clinical usability. To improve the transparency of our previous approach with minimal compromise to the maximal statin treatment benefit-to-risk ratio, this study proposed a five-step pipeline approach called the decision rules for statin treatment (DRST). Steps 1-3 of our proposed pipeline improved our previous PSTP model in optimizing individual benefit-to-risk ratio; Step 4 used a decision tree model (DRST) to provide straightforward rules in the initial statin treatment plan; Step 5 aimed to evaluate the efficacy of these decision rules by conducting a clinical trial simulation. We included 107,739 de-identified patient data from Optum Labs Database Warehouse in this study. The final decision rules were compact and efficient, resulting from a decision tree with only a maximum depth of 3 and 11 nodes. The DRST identified three factors that are easily obtainable at the point of care: age, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level, and age-adjusted Charlson score. Moreover, it also identified six subpopulations that can benefit most from these decision rules. In our clinical trial simulations, DRST was found to improve statin benefit in LDL-C reduction by 4.15 percentage points (pp) and reduce risks of statin-associated symptoms (SAS) and statin discontinuation by 11.71 and 3.96 pp, respectively, when compared to the standard of care. Moreover, these DRST results were only less than 0.6 pp suboptimal to PSTP, demonstrating that building DRST that provide transparency with minimal compromise to the maximal benefit-to-risk ratio of statin treatments is feasible.

AB  - The 'black-box' nature of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) limits their application in healthcare and many other prominent fields. The interpretable techniques for DNNs are expected to mitigate the potential issue. Causal analysis refers to methods and techniques to identify the pivotal causal relationships between the input data and the decision-making results. In this study, we developed a novel causal analysis mechanism to explain the internal computational logic of DNNs. We used a Boosting Ensemble Learning process to globally simulate DNNs to create a 'Grey-box' fitting model. By exploiting a degree of transparency that the Grey-box model has, we developed a rule extraction mechanism for collecting a set of causal rules from the fitting model to reveal the calculation logic of a type of operation in the network. The Gradient Boosting Decision Tree algorithm was performed to implement fitting learning for typical DNNs. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we applied the framework to the widely adopted U-Net for the task of glioma auto-segmentation on multi-sequence MRIs as the research object. A set of 79 rules were extracted from the fitting result to capture the logic of segmenting the enhancing tumor subregion by U-Net. Through carefully designed experiments, we validated the significance and utility of the identified causal rules. The causality analysis framework reveals the internal computational logic of complex DNNs for decision-making in target delineation and various clinical applications. Our work holds great potentials and insights for further improvement of DNN model performance and generalizability in medical image analysis and beyond.

AB  - ObjectivesBirthweight prediction in fetal development presents a challenge in direct measurement and often depends on empirical formulas based on the clinician's experience. Existing methods suffer from low accuracy and high execution times, limiting their clinical effectiveness. This study aims to introduce a novel approach integrating feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and Attention network to improve birthweight prediction using ultrasound data.MethodsThe proposed method utilizes FiLM for adaptive modulation, dynamically adjusting layer activations based on input specifics for enhanced information extraction. GRU is employed to capture sequential dependencies, recognizing the evolving maternal and fetal parameters during pregnancy. The Attention network selectively focuses on crucial parameters, dynamically adjusting feature weights for accurate predictions. The study evaluates classification accuracies for three groups: appropriate-for-gestational-age, large-for-gestational-age, and small-for-gestational-age (SGA). Prediction errors are minimized by optimizing parameters and using mean squared error as the loss function. Experimental evaluations are performed using multiple metrics.ResultsThe proposed strategy attains a high prediction accuracy of 98.8%, outperforming existing methods such as ensemble transfer learning model (83.5%), BabyNet++ (91.7%), bi-directional LSTM with CNN and a hybrid whale with oppositional fruit fly optimization (89.2%), linear regression-random forest-artificial neural network (79.5%), and Attention MFP-Unet (93.6%). The integrated network provides advanced insights into birthweight dynamics, enhancing both interpretability and accuracy.ConclusionsThe findings of this study are vital for birthweight prediction, clinical delivery guideline development, and implementation of decision-making. The proposed approach supports clinicians in making informed decisions during obstetric examinations and assists pregnant women in weight management, showcasing significant advancements in maternal healthcare.

AB  - The Corona Virus Disease 2019 has a great impact on public health and public psychology. People stay at home for a long time and rarely go out. With the improvement of the epidemic situation, people began to go to different places to check in. To maintain public mental health, it is necessary to propose a point-of-interest (POI) prediction model which can mine users' interests. However, the current techniques suffer from lower precision during prediction and the practical value is poor, which is due to the sparse data of users' check-in. Faced with this challenge, we propose an attention-based bidirectional gated recurrent unit (GRU) model for POI category prediction (ABG_poic). We regard the user's POI category as the user's interest preference because the fuzzy POI category is easier to reflect the user's interest than the POI. This method can alleviate the data sparsity, and protect users' location privacy. Since users' preferences are variable, we utilize a bidirectional GRU to capture the dynamic dependence of users' check-ins. Furthermore, since the neural network is similar to a "black box" in feature learning, the decision-making stage is opaque. Thus, we combine the attention mechanism with bidirectional GRU to selectively focus on historical check-in records, which can improve the interpretability of the model. Considering the time impact on users' check-in, we utilize the time sliding window in the ABG_poic model. Experiments on two data sets demonstrate that our ABG_poic outperforms the comparison models for POI category prediction on sparse check-in data.

AB  - Medical AI is increasingly being developed and tested to improve medical diagnosis, prediction and treatment of a wide array of medical conditions. Despite worries about the explainability and accuracy of such medical AI systems, it is reasonable to assume that they will be increasingly implemented in medical practice. Current ethical debates focus mainly on design requirements and suggest embedding certain values such as transparency, fairness, and explainability in the design of medical AI systems. Aside from concerns about their design, medical AI systems also raise questions with regard to physicians' responsibilities once these technologies are being implemented and used. How do physicians' responsibilities change with the implementation of medical AI? Which set of competencies do physicians have to learn to responsibly interact with medical AI? In the present article, we will introduce the notion of forward-looking responsibility and enumerate through this conceptual lens a number of competencies and duties that physicians ought to employ to responsibly utilize medical AI in practice. Those include amongst others understanding the range of reasonable outputs, being aware of own experience and skill decline, and monitoring potential accuracy decline of the AI systems.

AB  - Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have shown impressive performance in computer vision tasks; however, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks raises concerns regarding their security and reliability. Extensive research has shown that DNNs can be compromised by carefully crafted perturbations, leading to significant performance degradation in both digital and physical domains. Therefore, ensuring the security of DNN-based systems is crucial, particularly in safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving, robotics, smart homes/cities, smart industries, video surveillance, and healthcare. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of the current trends focusing specifically on physical adversarial attacks. We aim to provide a thorough understanding of the concept of physical adversarial attacks, analyzing their key characteristics and distinguishing features. Furthermore, we explore the specific requirements and challenges associated with executing attacks in the physical world. Our article delves into various physical adversarial attack methods, categorized according to their target tasks in different applications, including classification, detection, face recognition, semantic segmentation and depth estimation. We assess the performance of these attack methods in terms of their effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness. We examine how each technique strives to ensure the successful manipulation of DNNs while mitigating the risk of detection and withstanding real-world distortions. Lastly, we discuss the current challenges and outline potential future research directions in the field of physical adversarial attacks. We highlight the need for enhanced defense mechanisms, the exploration of novel attack strategies, the evaluation of attacks in different application domains, and the establishment of standardized benchmarks and evaluation criteria for physical adversarial attacks. Through this comprehensive survey, we aim to provide a valuable resource for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to gain a holistic understanding of physical adversarial attacks in computer vision and facilitate the development of robust and secure DNN-based systems.

AB  - Some of the recent studies on drug sensitivity prediction have applied graph neural networks to leverage prior knowledge on the drug structure or gene network, and other studies have focused on the interpretability of the model to delineate the mechanism governing the drug response. However, it is crucial to make a prediction model that is both knowledge-guided and interpretable, so that the prediction accuracy is improved and practical use of the model can be enhanced. We propose an interpretable model called DRPreter (drug response predictor and interpreter) that predicts the anticancer drug response. DRPreter learns cell line and drug information with graph neural networks; the cell-line graph is further divided into multiple subgraphs with domain knowledge on biological pathways. A type-aware transformer in DRPreter helps detect relationships between pathways and a drug, highlighting important pathways that are involved in the drug response. Extensive experiments on the GDSC (Genomics of Drug Sensitivity and Cancer) dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art graph-based models for drug response prediction. In addition, DRPreter detected putative key genes and pathways for specific drug-cell-line pairs with supporting evidence in the literature, implying that our model can help interpret the mechanism of action of the drug.

AB  - This paper presents a novel class of systems assisting diagnosis and personalised assessment of diseases in healthcare. The targeted systems are end-to-end deep neural architectures that are designed (trained and tested) and subsequently used as whole systems, accepting raw input data and producing the desired outputs. Such architectures are state-of-the-art in image analysis and computer vision, speech recognition and language processing. Their application in healthcare for prediction and diagnosis purposes can produce high accuracy results and can be combined with medical knowledge to improve effectiveness, adaptation and transparency of decision making. The paper focuses on neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Parkinson's, as the development model, by creating a new database and using it for training, evaluating and validating the proposed systems. Experimental results are presented which illustrate the ability of the systems to detect and predict Parkinson's based on medical imaging information.

AB  - Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been successful in solving real-world tasks in domains such as connected and automated vehicles, disease, and job hiring. However, their implications are far-reaching in critical application areas. Hence, there is a growing concern regarding the potential bias and robustness of these DNN models. A transparency and robust model is always demanded in high-stakes domains where reliability and safety are enforced, such as healthcare and finance. While most studies have focused on adversarial image attack scenarios, fewer studies have investigated the robustness of DNN models in natural language processing (NLP) due to their adversarial samples are difficult to generate. To address this gap, we propose a word-level NLP classifier attack model called "AED," which stands for Attention mechanism enabled post-model Explanation with Density peaks clustering algorithm for synonyms search and substitution. AED aims to test the robustness of NLP DNN models by interpretability their weaknesses and exploring alternative ways to optimize them. By identifying vulnerabilities and providing explanations, AED can help improve the reliability and safety of DNN models in critical application areas such as healthcare and automated transportation. Our experiment results demonstrate that compared with other existing models, AED can effectively generate adversarial examples that can fool the victim model while maintaining the original meaning of the input.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

T2  - JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE ENGINEERING
LA  - English
AB  - The Internet of Health Thing (IoHT) has various applications in healthcare. Modern IoHTintegrates health-related things like sensors and remotely observed medical devices for the assessment and managment of a patient's record to provide smarter and efficient health diagnostics to the patient. In this paper, we proposed an IoT with a cloud-based clinical decision support system for prediction and observation of disease with its severity level with the integration of 5G services and block-chain technologies. A block-chain is a system for storing and sharing information that is secure because of its transparency. Block-chain has many applications in healthcare and can improve mobile health applications, monitoring devices, sharing and storing of the electronic media records, clinical trial data, and insurance information storage. The proposed framework will collect the data of patients through medical devices that will be attached to the patient, and these data will be stored in a cloud server with relevant medical records. Deployment of Block-chain and 5G technology allows for sending patient data securely at a fast transmission rate with efficient response time. Furthermore, a Neural Network (NN) classifier is used for the prediction of diseases and their severity level. The proposed model is validated by employing different classifiers. The performance of different classifiers is measured by comparing the values to select the classifier that is the best for the dataset. The NN classifier attains an accuracy of 98.98. Furthermore, the NN is trained for the dataset so that it can predict the result of the dataset class that is not labeled. The trained Neural Network predicts and intelligently shows the results with more accuracy than other classifiers.

AB  - Classified as biomedical signal processing, cerebral signal processing plays a key role in human-computer interaction (HCI) and medical diagnosis. The motor imagery (MI) problem is an important research area in this field. Accurate solutions to this problem will greatly affect real-world applications. Most of the proposed methods are based on raw signal processing techniques. Known as prior knowledge, the structural-functional information and interregional connections can improve signal processing accuracy. It is possible to correctly perceive the generated signals by considering the brain structure (i.e. anatomical units), the source of signals, and the structural-functional dependence of different brain regions (i.e. effective connection) that are the semantic generators of signals. This study employed electroencephalograph (EEG) signals based on the activity of brain regions (cortex) and effective connections between brain regions based on dynamic causal modeling to solve the MI problem. EEG signals, as well as effective connections between brain regions to improve the interpretability of MI action, were fed into the architecture of Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN). The proposed model allowed GCN to extract more discriminative features. The results indicated that the proposed method was successful in developing a model with a MI detection accuracy of 93.73%.

AB  - By highlighting important features that contribute to model prediction, visual saliency is used as a natural form to interpret the working mechanism of deep neural networks. Numerous methods have been proposed to achieve better saliency results. However, we find that previous visual saliency methods are not reliable enough to provide meaningful interpretation through a simple sanity check: saliency methods are required to explain the output of non-maximum prediction classes, which are usually not ground-truth classes. For example, let the methods interpret an image of "dog" given a wrong class label "fish" as the query. This procedure can test whether these methods reliably interpret model's predictions based on existing features that appear in the data. Our experiments show that previous methods failed to pass the test by generating similar saliency maps or scattered patterns. This false saliency response can be dangerous in certain scenarios, such as medical diagnosis. We find that these failure cases are mainly due to the attribution vanishing and adversarial noise within these methods. In order to learn reliable visual saliency, we propose a simple method that requires the output of the model to be close to the original output while learning an explanatory saliency mask. To enhance the smoothness of the optimized saliency masks, we then propose a simple Hierarchical Attribution Fusion (HAF) technique. In order to fully evaluate the reliability of visual saliency methods, we propose a new task Disturbed Weakly Supervised Object Localization (D-WSOL) to measure whether these methods can correctly attribute the model's output to existing features. Experiments show that previous methods fail to meet this standard, and our approach helps to improve the reliability by suppressing false saliency responses. After observing a significant layout difference in saliency masks between real and adversarial samples. we propose to train a simple CNN on these learned hierarchical attribution masks to distinguish adversarial samples. Experiments show that our method can improve detection performance over other approaches significantly.

AB  - Vast quantities of Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) are routinely acquired in clinical practice but, to speed up acquisition, these scans are typically of a quality that is sufficient for clinical diagnosis but sub-optimal for large-scale precision medicine, computational diagnostics, and large-scale neuroimaging collaborative research. Here, we present a critic-guided framework to upsample low-resolution (often 2D) MRI full scans to help overcome these limitations. We incorporate feature-importance and self-attention methods into our model to improve the interpretability of this study. We evaluate our framework on paired low- and high-resolution brain MRI structural full scans (i.e., T1-, T2-weighted, and FLAIR sequences are simultaneously input) obtained in clinical and research settings from scanners manufactured by Siemens, Phillips, and GE. We show that the upsampled MRIs are qualitatively faithful to the ground-truth high-quality scans (PSNR = 35.39; MAE = 3.78E-3; NMSE = 4.32E-10; SSIM = 0.9852; mean normal-appearing gray/white matter ratio intensity differences ranging from 0.0363 to 0.0784 for FLAIR, from 0.0010 to 0.0138 for T1-weighted and from 0.0156 to 0.074 for T2-weighted sequences). The automatic raw segmentation of tissues and lesions using the super-resolved images has fewer false positives and higher accuracy than those obtained from interpolated images in protocols represented with more than three sets in the training sample, making our approach a strong candidate for practical application in clinical and collaborative research.

AB  - In National University Hospital (NUH) in Singapore, we conduct healthcare analytics that analyzes heterogeneous electronic medical records (EMR) to support effective clinical decision-making on a daily basis. Existing work mainly focuses on multimodality for extracting complementary information from different modalities, and/or interpretability for providing interpretable prediction results. However, real-world healthcare analytics has presented another major challenge, i.e., the available modalities evolve or change intermittently. Addressing this challenge requires deployed models to be adaptive to such dynamic modality changes. To meet the aforementioned requirement, we develop a modular, multimodal and interpretable framework DyHealth to enable dynamic healthcare analytics in clinical practice. Specifically, different modalities are processed within their respective data modules that adhere to the interface defined by DyHealth. The extracted information from different modalities is integrated subsequently in our proposed Multimodal Fusion Module in DyHealth. In order to better handle modality changes at runtime, we further propose exponential increasing/decreasing mechanisms to support modality "hot-plug". We also devise a novel modality-based attention mechanism for providing fine-grained interpretation results on a per-input basis. We conduct a pilot evaluation of DyHealth on the patients' EMR data from NUH, in which DyHealth achieves superior performance and therefore, is promising to roll out for hospital-wide deployment. We also validate DyHealth in two public EMR datasets. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness, flexibility, and extensibility of DyHealth in supporting multimodal and interpretable healthcare analytics.

We propose in this work AISEL, an active image synthesis method for efficient labeling, to improve the performance of the small-data learning tasks. Specifically, a complementary AISEL dataset is generated, with labels actively acquired via a physics-based method to incorporate underlining physical knowledge at hand. An important component of our AISEL method is the bidirectional generative invertible network (GIN), which can extract interpretable features from the training images and generate physically meaningful virtual images. Our AISEL method then efficiently samples virtual images not only further exploits the uncertain regions but also explores the entire image space. We then discuss the interpretability of GIN both theoretically and experimentally, demonstrating clear visual improvements over the benchmarks. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our AISEL framework on aortic stenosis application, in which our method lowers the labeling cost by 90 percent while achieving a 15 percent improvement in prediction accuracy.

AB  - Motivation: The human body hosts more microbial organisms than human cells. Analysis of this microbial diversity provides key insight into the role played by these microorganisms on human health. Metagenomics is the collective DNA sequencing of coexisting microbial organisms in an environmental sample or a host. This has several applications in precision medicine, agriculture, environmental science and forensics. State-of-the-art predictive models for phenotype predictions from metagenomic data rely on alignments, assembly, extensive pruning, taxonomic profiling and reference sequence databases. These processes are time consuming and they do not consider novel microbial sequences when aligned with the reference genome, limiting the potential of whole metagenomics. We formulate the problem of predicting human disease from whole-metagenomic data using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), a popular supervised learning paradigm. Our proposed alignment-free approach provides higher accuracy in prediction by harnessing the capability of deep convolutional neural network (CNN) within a MIL framework and provides interpretability via neural attention mechanism.
   Results: The MIL formulation combined with the hierarchical feature extraction capability of deep-CNN provides significantly better predictive performance compared to popular existing approaches. The attention mechanism allows for the identification of groups of sequences that are likely to be correlated to diseases providing the much-needed interpretation. Our proposed approach does not rely on alignment, assembly and reference sequence databases; making it fast and scalable for large-scale metagenomic data. We evaluate our method on well-known large-scale metagenomic studies and show that our proposed approach outperforms comparative state-of-the-art methods for disease prediction.

AB  - Analysis of patients' Electronic Health Records (EHRs) can help guide the prevention of diseases and personalization of treatment. Therefore, it is an important task to predict the disease onset information (referred to as medical codes in this paper) within the upcoming visit based on patients' EHR data. In order to achieve this objective, the real-time nature and high dimensionality of EHR data must be addressed. Moreover, the prediction results of the model must be interpretable. Existing methods mainly use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to model EHR data and adopt attention mechanism to provide interpretability. However, diagnosis and treatment information have usually been regarded as the same kind of information, the difference and relationship between the two parts being ignored. This has led to unclear analysis about the patient's disease development and inaccurate prediction results. To address this limitation, we propose a CrossOver Attention Model (COAM). This model adopts two RNNs to process diagnosis and treatment information, respectively, and then deploys a crossover attention mechanism to improve prediction accuracy by leveraging the correlation between the two parts of information. It can learn effective representations of personal medical diagnosis and treatment, and provide interpretable prediction results. Experiments demonstrate that COAM can significantly improve the accuracy of prediction and provide clinically meaningful explanations.

AB  - Myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the most common cardiovascular diseases threatening human life. In order to accurately distinguish myocardial infarction and have a good interpretability, the classification method that combines rule features and ventricular activity features is proposed in this paper. Specifically, according to the clinical diagnosis rule and the pathological changes of myocardial infarction on the electrocardiogram, the local information extracted from the Q wave, ST segment, and T wave is computed as the rule feature. All samples of the QT segment are extracted as ventricular activity features. Then, in order to reduce the computational complexity of the ventricular activity features, the effects of Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Locality Preserving Projections (LPP) on the extracted ventricular activity features are compared. Combining rule features and ventricular activity features, all the 12 leads features are fused as the ultimate feature vector. Finally, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) is used to identify myocardial infarction, and the overall accuracy rate of 99.86% is obtained on the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) database. This method has a good medical diagnosis basis while improving the accuracy, which is very important for clinical decision-making.

AB  - Background: Diagnosis prediction aims to predict the future health status of patients according to their historical electronic health records (EHR), which is an important yet challenging task in healthcare informatics. Existing diagnosis prediction approaches mainly employ recurrent neural networks (RNN) with attention mechanisms to make predictions. However, these approaches ignore the importance of code descriptions, i.e., the medical definitions of diagnosis codes. We believe that taking diagnosis code descriptions into account can help the state-of-the-art models not only to learn meaning code representations, but also to improve the predictive performance, especially when the EHR data are insufficient.
   Methods: We propose a simple, but general diagnosis prediction framework, which includes two basic components: diagnosis code embedding and predictive model. To learn the interpretable code embeddings, we apply convolutional neural networks (CNN) to model medical descriptions of diagnosis codes extracted from online medical websites. The learned medical embedding matrix is used to embed the input visits into vector representations, which are fed into the predictive models. Any existing diagnosis prediction approach (referred to as the base model) can be cast into the proposed framework as the predictive model (called the enhanced model).
   Results: We conduct experiments on two real medical datasets: the MIMIC-III dataset and the Heart Failure claim dataset. Experimental results show that the enhanced diagnosis prediction approaches significantly improve the prediction performance. Moreover, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework with insufficient EHR data. Finally, we visualize the learned medical code embeddings to show the interpretability of the proposed framework.
   Conclusions: Given the historical visit records of a patient, the proposed framework is able to predict the next visit information by incorporating medical code descriptions.

AB  - Fuzzy inference systems have been frequently used in medical diagnosis for managing uncertainty sources in the medical images. In addition, fuzzy systems have high level of interpretability because of using linguistic terms for knowledge representation through the reasoning process. The evolutionary algorithms can be applied for optimization of the systems. This article takes advantages of differential evolutionary algorithm to search the problem space more intelligently using the knowledge of distance vector of the candidate solutions. For this, a hybrid fuzzy-DE model has been proposed for the problem of classification of the Haptic metastasis tumors through information obtained from the features measured in the CT scan images by radiologists. The hybrid fuzzy-DE model was evaluated using a real liver cancer dataset obtained from the Noor medical imaging center in Tehran. The results of the hybrid proposed models were compared with the diagnosis of the specialists, the results reveal that the proposed fuzzy-DE model has high capability for diagnosis of the hepatic metastasis tumors with an accuracy of 99.24% with 95% confidence interval (98.32 100) in terms of area under the ROC curve. The proposed model outperforms the multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network and fuzzy-genetic algorithm (GA). The proposed model improves the trade-offs between the accuracy and interpretability by providing a model with high accuracy using less input variables. The hybrid fuzzy-DE model is promising to assist the medical specialists for early diagnosis of liver cancer and save more people lives.

AB  - Cervical cancer is caused in the vast majority of cases by the human papilloma virus (HPV) through sexual contact and requires a specific molecular-based analysis to be detected. As an HPV vaccine is available, the incidence of cervical cancer is up to ten times higher in areas without adequate healthcare resources. In recent years, liquid cytology has been used to overcome these shortcomings and perform mass screening. In addition, classifiers based on convolutional neural networks can be developed to help pathologists diagnose the disease. However, these systems always require the final verification of a pathologist to make a final diagnosis. For this reason, explainable AI techniques are required to highlight the most significant data to the healthcare professional, as it can be used to determine the confidence in the results and the areas of the image used for classification (allowing the professional to point out the areas he/she thinks are most important and cross-check them against those detected by the system in order to create incremental learning systems). In this work, a 4-phase optimization process is used to obtain a custom deep-learning classifier for distinguishing between 4 severity classes of cervical cancer with liquid-cytology images. The final classifier obtains an accuracy over 97% for 4 classes and 100% for 2 classes with execution times under 1 s (including the final report generation). Compared to previous works, the proposed classifier obtains better accuracy results with a lower computational cost.

AB  - Due to the complex structure of the brain, variations in tumor shapes and sizes, and the resemblance between tumor and healthy tissues, the reliable and efficient identification of brain tumors through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) presents a persistent challenge. Given that manual identification of tumors is often time-consuming and prone to errors, there is a clear need for advanced automated procedures to enhance detection accuracy and efficiency. Our study addresses the difficulty by creating an improved convolutional neural network (CNN) framework derived from DenseNet121 to augment the accuracy of brain tumor detection. The proposed model was comprehensively evaluated against 12 baseline CNN models and 5 state-of-the-art architectures, namely Vision Transformer (ViT), ConvNeXt, MobileNetV3, FastViT, and InternImage. The proposed model achieved exceptional accuracy rates of 98.4% and 99.3% on two separate datasets, outperforming all 17 models evaluated. Our improved model was integrated using Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, particularly Grad-CAM++, facilitating accurate diagnosis and localization of complex tumor instances, including small metastatic lesions and nonenhancing low-grade gliomas. The XAI framework distinctly highlights essential areas signifying tumor presence, hence enhancing the model's accuracy and interpretability. The results highlight the potential of our method as a reliable diagnostic instrument for healthcare practitioners' ability to comprehend and confirm artificial intelligence (AI)-driven predictions but also bring transparency to the model's decision-making process, ultimately improving patient outcomes. This advancement signifies a significant progression in the use of AI in neuro-oncology, enhancing diagnostic interpretability and precision.

AB  - Diabetic distress is a significant psychological burden affecting many individuals with Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus. Despite its prevalence, it remains underrecognized, and its impact can be complex. This study explores the integration of multimodal data sources and machine learning to identify diabetic distress and emotional burden in patients with Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus. The study highlights the use of Explainable Artificial Intelligence to make predictions more transparent. It combines patient information like age, gender, laboratory results, and survey scores to train and compare machine learning methods. Models tested include Ridge regression, Lasso regression, linear and logistic regression, neural networks, support vector machines, random forests, and various boosting techniques. Among all of these, Extreme Gradient Boosting with SHapley Additive exPlanations delivered the best results. It was 96.14% accurate, 0.94 precise, had an ROC-AUC of 0.98, an F1-score of 0.95, and a recall of 0.95. The approach also generates explanations of why a specific prediction is being generated. For instance, it shows how specific blood glucose levels or distress subscale scores influence the predicted emotional load. These clear explanations enable clinicians to make sense of both the model's performance and the reasoning behind it. Such transparency is critical to the building of trust in machine learning-based decision support systems for diabetes care takers influencing DDS.

AB  - Background: Urothelial bladder cancer (UBC) is characterized by a high recurrence rate, which is predicted by scoring systems. However, recent studies show the superiority of Machine Learning (ML) models. Nevertheless, these ML approaches are rarely used in medical practice because most of them are black-box models, that cannot adequately explain how a prediction is made. Objective: We investigate the global feature importance of different ML models. By providing information on the most relevant features, we can facilitate the use of ML in everyday medical practice. Design, setting, and participants: The data is provided by the cancer registry Rhineland-Palatinate gGmbH, Germany. It consists of numerical and categorical features of 1,944 patients with UBC. We retrospectively predict 2-year recurrence through ML models using Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting, and Artificial Neural Network. We then determine the global feature importance using performance-based Permutation Feature Importance (PFI) and variance-based Feature Importance Ranking Measure (FIRM). Results: We show reliable recurrence prediction of UBC with 82.02% to 83.89% F1-Score, 83.95% to 84.49% Precision, and an overall performance of 69.20% to 70.82% AUC on testing data, depending on the model. Gradient Boosting performs best among all black-box models with an average F1-Score (83.89%), AUC (70.82%), and Precision (83.95%). Furthermore, we show consistency across PFI and FIRM by identifying the same features as relevant across the different models. These features are exclusively therapeutic measures and are consistent with findings from both medical research and clinical trials. Conclusions: We confirm the superiority of ML black-box models in predicting UBC recurrence compared to more traditional logistic regression. In addition, we present an approach that increases the explanatory power of black- box models by identifying the underlying influence of input features, thus facilitating the use of ML in clinical practice and therefore providing improved recurrence prediction through the application of black-box models.

AB  - Motivation: Interpretability has become a necessary feature for machine learning models deployed in critical scenarios, e.g. legal system, healthcare. In these situations, algorithmic decisions may have (potentially negative) long-lasting effects on the end-user affected by the decision. While deep learning models achieve impressive results, they often function as a black-box. Inspired by linear models, we propose a novel class of structurally constrained deep neural networks, which we call FLAN (Feature-wise Latent Additive Networks). Crucially, FLANs process each input feature separately, computing for each of them a representation in a common latent space. These feature-wise latent representations are then simply summed, and the aggregated representation is used for the prediction. These feature-wise representations allow a user to estimate the effect of each individual feature independently from the others, similarly to the way linear models are interpreted.: Results: We demonstrate FLAN on a series of benchmark datasets in different biological domains. Our experiments show that FLAN achieves good performances even in complex datasets (e.g. TCR-epitope binding prediction), despite the structural constraint we imposed. On the other hand, this constraint enables us to interpret FLAN by deciphering its decision process, as well as obtaining biological insights (e.g. by identifying the marker genes of different cell populations). In supplementary experiments, we show similar performances also on non-biological datasets.Code and data availabilityCode and example data are available at .

AB  - Tele health utilizes information and communication mechanisms to convey medical information for providing clinical and educational assistances. It makes an effort to get the better of issues of health service delivery involving time factor, space and laborious terrains, validating cost-efficiency and finer ingress in both developed and developing countries. Tele health has been categorized into either real-time electronic communication, or store-and forward communication. In recent years, a third-class has been perceived as remote healthcare monitoring or tele health, presuming data obtained via Internet of Things (IOT). Although, tele health data analytics and machine learning have been researched in great depth, there is a dearth of studies that entirely concentrate on the progress of ML-based techniques for tele health data analytics in the IoT healthcare sector. Motivated by this fact, in this work a method called, Weighted Bayesian and Polynomial Taylor Deep Network (WB-PTDN) is proposed to improve health prediction in a computationally efficient and accurate manner. First, the Independent Component Data Arrangement model is designed with the objective of normalizing the data obtained from the Physionet dataset. Next, with the normalized data as input, Weighted Bayesian Feature Extraction is applied to minimize the dimensionality involved and therefore extracting the relevant features for further health risk analysis. Finally, to obtain reliable predictions concerning tele health data analytics, First Order Polynomial Taylor DNN-based Feature Homogenization is proposed that with the aid of First Order Polynomial Taylor function updates the new results based on the result analysis of old values and therefore provides increased transparency in decision making. The comparison of proposed and existing methods indicates that the WB-PTDN method achieves higher accuracy, true positive rate and lesser response time for IoT based tele health data analytics than the traditional methods.

AB  - Medical cyber-physical systems (MCPS) represent a platform through which patient health data are acquired by emergent Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, preprocessed locally, and managed through improved machine intelligence algorithms. Wireless medical cyber-physical systems are extensively adopted in the daily practices of medicine, where vast amounts of data are sampled using wireless medical devices and sensors and passed to decision support systems (DSSs). With the development of physical systems incorporating cyber frameworks, cyber threats have far more acute effects, as they are reproduced in the physical environment. Patients' personal information must be shielded against intrusions to preserve their privacy and confidentiality. Therefore, every bit of information stored in the database needs to be kept safe from intrusion attempts. The IWMCPS proposed in this work takes into account all relevant security concerns. This paper summarizes three years of fieldwork by presenting an IWMCPS framework consisting of several components and subsystems. The IWMCPS architecture is developed, as evidenced by a scenario including applications in the medical sector. Cyber-physical systems are essential to the healthcare sector, and life-critical and context-aware health data are vulnerable to information theft and cyber-okayattacks. Reliability, confidence, security, and transparency are some of the issues that must be addressed in the growing field of MCPS research. To overcome the abovementioned problems, we present an improved wireless medical cyber-physical system (IWMCPS) based on machine learning techniques. The heterogeneity of devices included in these systems (such as mobile devices and body sensor nodes) makes them prone to many attacks. This necessitates effective security solutions for these environments based on deep neural networks for attack detection and classification. The three core elements in the proposed IWMCPS are the communication and monitoring core, the computational and safety core, and the real-time planning and administration of resources. In this study, we evaluated our design with actual patient data against various security attacks, including data modification, denial of service (DoS), and data injection. The IWMCPS method is based on a patient-centric architecture that preserves the end-user's smartphone device to control data exchange accessibility. The patient health data used in WMCPSs must be well protected and secure in order to overcome cyber-physical threats. Our experimental findings showed that our model attained a high detection accuracy of 92% and a lower computational time of 13 sec with fewer error analyses.

AB  - Knowing the basis of decisions is essential for using Machine Learning (ML) in various regions, such as medical diagnosis, finance, and organizational decision-making. The Local Interpretable Model agnostic Explanation (LIME) algorithm is an Explainable AI (XAI) method that can be applied to many black -box models. However, there is a problem in that the local fidelity of the interpretable model decreases. Therefore, local fidelity must be increased, and the more interpretability of the local surrogate model, the better. Moreover, the fewer the changes, the easier it is to apply them to other studies and the more significant the contribution to the XAI area. Therefore, there are studies that improve fidelity by changing only the sampling. However, no studies have been identified that improve local fidelity and interpretability by modifying only the sampling. To this end, we use a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) to modify the sampling of LIME in the classification task to improve local fidelity and interpretability. We conducted a study to improve local fidelity and interpretability by modifying only the sampling part and clarifying the mechanism behind this improvement. Results show that the proposed method improves local fidelity while increasing interpretability compared to existing methods and the factors contributing to this improvement. We also conducted experiments on stability, stability against noise, and execution time, and confirmed that the proposed method performs well, although not as well as methods specific to these issues.

AB  - In the future of healthcare, Blockchain (BC) technology holds immense potential for improving the security and privacy of data. By allowing the secure and immutable storage of medical files and healthcare-related transactions, BC ensured that sensitive medical data remains tamper-proof and open only to authorized parties. Patients have greater control over their data's development, revoking or granting access as required, but healthcare workers can streamline data sharing and ensure the integrity of important data. The decentralized nature of BC networks decreases the risk of centralized data breaches, eventually fostering trust and transparency in the healthcare ecosystems. Conversely, deep learning (DL) has great to revolutionize healthcare diagnostics in the future, offering quick and extremely accurate estimates of medical conditions. This technology has greatly enhanced patient solutions, decreased medical expenses, and improved the burden on medical staff by providing appreciated insights into an extensive range of conditions, from cancer to neurological disorders. With this stimulus, this study presents a novel BC with optimal DL-based secure data sharing and classification (BCODLSDSC) technique in the future healthcare system. The goal of the BCODL-SDSC technique is to secure and thoroughly examine healthcare data using BC and DL techniques. Primarily, the BCODL-SDSC technique enables BC technology to store and maintain the patient's data from the procedure of several transactions and enable access control to the various stakeholders. For the security of the medical images, the BCODL-SDSC technique applies the Fractional Order Lorenz system (FOLS) based encryption technique with tuna swarm optimization (TSO) algorithm based optimal key generation process. Finally, a multi-stage process performs the classification of the medical images: MobileNetv1 feature extractor, artificial rabbit's optimization (ARO) based hyperparameter tuning, and stacked recurrent neural network (SRNN) based classification. The experimental outcome of the BCODL-SDSC technique was examined on a benchmark medical image database. An extensive comparative study reported that the BCODL-SDSC technique reaches an effective performance with other models with a maximum accuracy of 99.11%.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases continue to be the leading cause of mortality worldwide, claiming a significant number of lives each year. Despite the advancements in predictive models, including logistic regression, neural networks, and random forests, these techniques often lack transparency and interpretability, limiting their practical application in clinical settings. To address this challenge, this research introduces EPFHD-RARMING, an innovative approach designed to enhance the understanding and predictability of heart disease through the discovery of rare and meaningful patterns. EPFHD-RARMING utilizes rare association rule mining to uncover hidden and unexpected rules that identify critical factors contributing to heart disease. This method is particularly adept at identifying high-risk patterns in individuals who appear healthy but may develop heart disease under certain conditions, thus facilitating early intervention and preventive measures. By integrating these insights with established feature engineering techniques, EPFHD-RARMING enhances its practical utility, enabling medical professionals to proactively manage patient care and tailor interventions to individual risk profiles. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of EPFHD-RARMING in providing a deeper, actionable understanding of the complex dynamics of heart disease. The model's ability to identify and interpret rare patterns holds significant promise for advancing medical analytics and improving patient outcomes. Moreover, the applicability of EPFHD-RARMING extends beyond the healthcare domain, offering valuable insights in various fields where the discovery of rare patterns is critical, such as finance, marketing, and cybersecurity. This study conducts a comprehensive evaluation, which demonstrates the superior performance of EPFHD-RARMING compared to traditional predictive models in identifying key factors contributing to heart disease, in terms of interestingness, explainability, and comprehensiveness of insights. The results underscore the potential of this innovative approach to revolutionize our understanding and prediction of heart disease, ultimately contributing to more effective and personalized healthcare solutions. This research emphasizes the importance of rare association rule mining in medical analytics and paves the way for future studies to explore and utilize these techniques across diverse domains.

AB  - Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) have the potential to save lives and reduce unnecessary costs through early detection and frequent monitoring of both traditional risk factors and novel biomarkers for cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the widespread adoption of CDSSs for the identification of heart diseases has been limited, likely due to the poor interpretability of clinically relevant results and the lack of seamless integration between measurements and disease predictions. In this paper we present the Cardiac ScoreCard-a multivariate index assay system with the potential to assist in the diagnosis and prognosis of a spectrum of CVD. The Cardiac ScoreCard system is based on lasso logistic regression techniques which utilize both patient demographics and novel biomarker data for the prediction of heart failure (HF) and cardiac wellness. Lasso logistic regression models were trained on a merged clinical dataset comprising 579 patients with 6 traditional risk factors and 14 biomarker measurements. The prediction performance of the Cardiac ScoreCard was assessed with 5-fold cross-validation and compared with reference methods. The experimental results reveal that the ScoreCard models improved performance in discriminating disease versus non-case (ADC = 0.8403 and 0.9412 for cardiac wellness and HF, respectively), and the models exhibit good calibration. Clinical insights to the prediction of HF and cardiac wellness are provided in the form of logistic regression coefficients which suggest that augmenting the traditional risk factors with a multimarker panel spanning a diverse cardiovascular pathophysiology provides improved performance over reference methods.

AB  - Background: The identification of an appropriate rhythm management strategy for patients diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (AF) remains a major challenge for providers. Although clinical trials have identified subgroups of patients in whom a rate- or rhythm-control strategy might be indicated to improve outcomes, the wide range of presentations and risk factors among patients presenting with AF makes such approaches challenging. The strength of electronic health records is the ability to build in logic to guide management decisions, such that the system can automatically identify patients in whom a rhythm-control strategy is more likely and can promote efficient referrals to specialists. However, like any clinical decision support tool, there is a balance between interpretability and accurate prediction. Objective: This study aims to create an electronic health record-based prediction tool to guide patient referral to specialists for rhythm-control management by comparing different machine learning algorithms. Methods: We compared machine learning models of increasing complexity and used up to 50,845 variables to predict the rhythm-control strategy in 42,022 patients within the University of Colorado Health system at the time of AF diagnosis. Models were evaluated on the basis of their classification accuracy, defined by the F1 score and other metrics, and interpretability, captured Results: We found that age was by far the strongest single predictor of a rhythm-control strategy but that greater accuracy could be achieved with more complex models incorporating neural networks and more predictors for each participant. We determined that the impact of better prediction models was notable primarily in the rate of inappropriate referrals for rhythm-control, in which more complex models provided an average of 20% fewer inappropriate referrals than simpler, more interpretable models. Conclusions: We conclude that any health care system seeking to incorporate algorithms to guide rhythm management for patients with AF will need to address this trade-off between prediction accuracy and model interpretability.

AB  - In personalized predictive medicine, accurately modeling a patient's illness and care processes is essential, given their inherent long-term temporal dependencies. However, Electronic Health Records (EHRs) often contain episodic and irregularly timed data, resulting from patients' sporadic hospital admissions, leading to unique patterns for each hospital stay. Consequently, constructing a personalized predictive model requires careful consideration of these factors to accurately capture the patient's health journey and assist in clinical decision-making. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is an effective model for handling sequential data, such as EHRs, but it encounters two major limitations when applied to EHRs: it is unable to interpret the prediction results and it ignores the irregular time intervals between consecutive events. To tackle these limitations, we present a novel deep dynamic memory neural network called Adaptive Multi-Way Interpretable Time-Aware LSTM for irregularly collected sequential data "AMITA". The primary objective of AMITA is to leverage medical records, memorize illness trajectories and care processes, estimate current illness states, and predict future risks, thereby providing a high level of precision and predictive power. To enhance its capabilities, AMITA extends the standard LSTM model in two key ways. Firstly, it incorporates frequency measurement and the most recent observation to enhance personalized predictive modeling of patient illnesses, enabling a more accurate understanding of the patient's condition. Secondly, it parameterizes the cell state to handle irregular timing effectively, utilizing both elapsed times and a frequency-based decay factor, which considers both measurement frequency and contextual information. Furthermore, the model capitalizes on both to comprehend the impact of interventions on the course of illness on the cell state, facilitating the memorization of illness courses and improving its ability to capture the temporal dynamics of healthcare data, accommodating variations and irregularities in event and observation timing. The effectiveness of our proposed model is validated through empirical experiments conducted on two real-world clinical datasets. The results demonstrate the superiority of AMITA over current state-of-the-art models and other robust baselines, showcasing its potential in advancing personalized predictive medicine by offering a more accurate and comprehensive approach to modeling patient health trajectories.

AB  - Facial expression recognition (FER) continues to be a vibrant research field, driven by the increasing need for its practical applications in areas such as e-learning, healthcare, candidate interview analysis, and more. Most deep learning approaches in supervised FER systems heavily rely on large, labeled datasets. Implementing FER in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) often requires many layers, leading to extended training times and difficulties in finding optimal parameters. This can result in challenges in creating distinct facial expression patterns for classification, leading to poor real-time emotion classification In this paper, we propose a novel approach known as the Deep Semi-supervised Convolutional Sparse Autoencoder to address the aforementioned issues and enhance FER performance and prediction accuracy. This approach comprises two parts: (i) Initially, a deep convolutional sparse autoencoder is trained with unlabeled samples of facial expressions. Here, sparsity is introduced in the convolutional block to enforce penalties, focusing on more relevant features for feature representation in the latent space. (ii) A trained encoder with a feature map is connected to a fully connected layer with softmax for final fine-tuning with learned weights and labeled facial expression samples in a semi-supervised approach for emotion classification. This approach was experimented with two benchmark datasets, namely CK + and JAFFE, and achieved significant results of 98.98% and 93.10% accuracy, respectively. The results were analyzed using established state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, eXplainable AI (XAI) methods like Grad-CAM and image-LIME were employed to interpret the performance and prediction outcomes of the DSCSA model.

AB  - Predicting health-related outcomes can help with proactive healthcare planning and resource management. This is especially important on the older population, an age group growing in the coming decades. Considering longitudinal rather than cross-sectional information from primary care electronic health records (EHRs) can contribute to more informed predictions. In this work, we developed prediction models using longitudinal EHRs to inform resource allocation. In this study, we developed deep-learning-based prognostic models to predict 1-year and 5-year all-cause mortality, nursing home admission, and home care need in people over 65 years old using all the longitudinal information from EHRs. The models included attention mechanisms to increase their transparency. EHRs were drawn from SIDIAP (primary care, Catalonia (Spain)) from 2010-2019. Performance on the test set was compared to that from baseline models using cross-sectional one-year history only. Data from 1,456,052 individuals over 65 years old were considered. Cohen's kappa obtained using longitudinal data was 3.4-fold (1-year all-cause mortality), 10.3-fold (5-year all-cause mortality), 1.1-fold (5-year nursing home admission), and 1.2-fold (5-year home care need) higher than that obtained by the one-year history baseline models. Our models performed better than those not considering longitudinal data, especially when predicting further into the future. However, nursing home admission and home care need in the long term were harder to predict, suggesting their dependence on more abrupt changes. The attention maps helped to understand the predictions, enhancing model transparency. These prediction models can contribute to improve resource allocation in the general population of aging adults.

AB  - Medical image analysis holds major significance in modern healthcare, which is essential for both diagnosing diseases and planning treatment. The development of advanced imaging mechanisms like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computed Tomography (CT) has become a necessary instrument in clinical practice. Through the analysis of these imaging techniques, medical professionals receive detailed insights into anatomic structures and pathological conditions. Yet, it poses challenges related to classification accuracy and privacy measures, demanding innovative approaches to ensure reliable diagnosis and patient confidentiality. To tackle these problems, we introduce a novel approach integrating Federated Learning with a hybrid optimization algorithm (FL Brain-HOA) to enhance brain tumor detection accuracy as well as privacy. This model enables collaborative training across multiple decentralized clients without sharing raw medical data, there by preserving patient privacy To dynamically tune the hyperparameters of the CNN models, such as the GA-SA optimizer is used and deployed locally at each client, where the model accuracy and performs well in correctly detecting and classifying brain tumors even in the non-IID situation. A fitness-score-guided aggregation strategy is introduced to enhance global model convergence by prioritizing high-quality local updates. The model further incorporates Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) for visual interpretability, allowing clinicians to understand the rationale behind each prediction. The FL Brain-HOA model demonstrates strong performance in evaluating brain tumor MRI and Brats 19 datasets with 98.75% of accuracy, 98.32% of precision, 97.86% of recall, 98.08% of F1-score, and 0.987 AUC-ROC in brain tumor MRI dataset and obtained 98.02% accuracy, 98.23% precision, 97.65% recall and 97.93% of F1-score in Brats 2019 dataset. The simulation result indicates our FL Brain-HOA model is superior in the detection of brain tumors and improves categorization accuracy while supporting the principles of data privacy and paving the way for more effective diagnosis, treatment, and management of brain tumors.

AB  - Prognostic survival prediction in colorectal cancer (CRC) plays a crucial role in guiding treatment decisions and improving patient outcomes. In this research, we explore the application of deep learning techniques to predict survival outcomes based on histopathological images of human colorectal cancer. We present a retrospective multicenter study utilizing a dataset of 100,000 nonoverlapping image patches from hematoxylin & eosin-stained histological images of CRC and normal tissue. The dataset includes diverse tissue classes such as adipose, background, debris, lymphocytes, mucus, smooth muscle, normal colon mucosa, cancer-associated stroma, and colorectal adenocarcinoma epithelium. To perform survival prediction, we employ various deep learning architectures, including convolutional neural network, DenseNet201, InceptionResNetV2, VGG16, VGG19, and Xception. These architectures are trained on the dataset using a multicenter retrospective analysis approach. Extensive preprocessing steps are undertaken, including image normalization using Macenko's method and data augmentation techniques, to optimize model performance. The experimental findings reveal promising results, demonstrating the effectiveness of deep learning models in prognostic survival prediction. Our models achieve high accuracy, precision, recall, and validation metrics, showcasing their ability to capture relevant histological patterns associated with prognosis. Visualization techniques are employed to interpret the models' decision-making process, highlighting important features and regions contributing to survival predictions. The implications of this research are manifold. The accurate prediction of survival outcomes in CRC can aid in personalized medicine and clinical decision-making, facilitating tailored treatment plans for individual patients. The identification of important histological features and biomarkers provides valuable insights into disease mechanisms and may lead to the discovery of novel prognostic indicators. The transparency and explainability of the models enhance trust and acceptance, fostering their integration into clinical practice. Research demonstrates the potential of deep learning models for prognostic survival prediction in human colorectal cancer histology. The findings contribute to the understanding of disease progression and offer practical applications in personalized medicine. By harnessing the power of deep learning and histopathological analysis, we pave the way for improved patient care, clinical decision support, and advancements in prognostic prediction in CRC.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR), retinal vein occlusion (RVO), and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) pose significant global health challenges, often resulting in vision impairment and blindness. Automatic detection of these conditions is crucial, particularly in underserved rural areas with limited access to ophthalmic services. Despite remarkable advancements in artificial intelligence, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), their complexity can make interpretation difficult. In this study, we curated a dataset consisting of 15,089 color fundus photographs (CFPs) obtained from 8110 patients who underwent fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) examination. The primary objective was to construct integrated models that merge CNNs with an attention mechanism. These models were designed for a hierarchical multilabel classification task, focusing on the detection of DR, RVO, AMD, and other fundus conditions. Furthermore, our approach extended to the detailed classification of DR, RVO, and AMD according to their respective subclasses. We employed a methodology that entails the translation of diagnostic information obtained from FFA results into CFPs. Our investigation focused on evaluating the models' ability to achieve precise diagnoses solely based on CFPs. Remarkably, our models showcased improvements across diverse fundus conditions, with the ConvNeXt-base + attention model standing out for its exceptional performance. The ConvNeXt-base + attention model achieved remarkable metrics, including an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.943, a referable F1 score of 0.870, and a Cohen's kappa of 0.778 for DR detection. For RVO, it attained an AUC of 0.960, a referable F1 score of 0.854, and a Cohen's kappa of 0.819. Furthermore, in AMD detection, the model achieved an AUC of 0.959, an F1 score of 0.727, and a Cohen's kappa of 0.686. Impressively, the model demonstrated proficiency in subclassifying RVO and AMD, showcasing commendable sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, our models enhanced interpretability by visualizing attention weights on fundus images, aiding in the identification of disease findings. These outcomes underscore the substantial impact of our models in advancing the detection of DR, RVO, and AMD, offering the potential for improved patient outcomes and positively influencing the healthcare landscape.

AB  - Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a heterogeneous condition; multiple underlying neurobiological and behavioral substrates are associated with treatment response variability. Understanding the sources of this variability and predicting outcomes has been elusive. Machine learning (ML) shows promise in predicting treatment response in MDD, but its application is limited by challenges to the clinical interpretability of ML models, and clinicians often lack confidence in model results. In order to improve the interpretability of ML models in clinical practice, our goal was to demonstrate the derivation of treatment-relevant patient profiles comprised of clinical and demographic information using a novel ML approach. Methods: We analyzed data from six clinical trials of pharmacological treatment for depression (total n = 5438) using the Differential Prototypes Neural Network (DPNN), a ML model that derives patient prototypes which can be used to derive treatment-relevant patient clusters while learning to generate probabilities for differential treatment response. A model classifying remission and outputting individual remission probabilities for five first -line monotherapies and three combination treatments was trained using clinical and demographic data. Prototypes were evaluated for interpretability by assessing differences in feature distributions (e.g. age, sex, symptom severity) and treatment -specific outcomes. Results: A 3 -prototype model achieved an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.66 and an expected absolute improvement in remission rate for those receiving the best predicted treatment of 6.5% (relative improvement of 15.6%) compared to the population remission rate. We identified three treatmentrelevant patient clusters. Cluster A patients tended to be younger, to have increased levels of fatigue, and more severe symptoms. Cluster B patients tended to be older, female, have less severe symptoms, and the highest remission rates. Cluster C patients had more severe symptoms, lower remission rates, more psychomotor agitation, more intense suicidal ideation, and more somatic genital symptoms. Conclusion: It is possible to produce novel treatment -relevant patient profiles using ML models; doing so may improve interpretability of ML models and the quality of precision medicine treatments for MDD.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has achieved notable performances in many fields and its research impact in healthcare has been unquestionable. Nevertheless, the deployment of such computational models in clinical practice is still limited. Some of the major issues recognized as barriers to a successful real-world machine learning applications include lack of: transparency; reliability and personalization. Actually, these aspects are decisive not only for patient safety, but also to assure the confidence of professionals. Explainable AI aims at to achieve solutions for artificial intelligence transparency and reliability concerns, with the capacity to better understand and trust a model, providing the ability to justify its outcomes, thus effectively assisting clinicians in rationalizing the model prediction. This work proposes an innovative machine learning based approach, implementing a hybrid scheme, able to combine in a systematic way knowledge-driven and data-driven techniques. In a first step a global set of interpretable rules is generated, founded on clinical evidence. Then, in a second phase, a machine learning model is trained to select, from the global set of rules, the subset that is more appropriate for a given patient, according to his particular characteristics. This approach addresses simultaneously three of the central requirements of explainable AI-interpretability, personalization, and reliability-without impairing the accuracy of the model's prediction. The scheme was validated with a real dataset provided by two Portuguese Hospitals, the Santa Cruz Hospital, Lisbon, and the Santo Andre Hospital, Leiria, comprising a total of N = 1111 patients that suffered an acute coronary syndrome event, where the 30 days mortality was assessed. When compared with standard black-box structures (e.g. feedforward neural network) the proposed scheme achieves similar performances, while ensures simultaneously clinical interpretability and personalization of the model, as well as provides a level of reliability to the estimated mortality risk.

AB  - Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a popular malignant tumor of the head and neck which is endemic in the world, more than 75% of the NPC patients suffer from locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (LA-NPC). The survival quality of these patients depends on the reliable prediction of NPC stages III and IVa. In this paper, we propose a two-stage framework to produce the classification probabilities for predicting NPC stages III and IVa. The preprocessing of MR images enhance the quality of images for further analysis. In stage one transfer learning is used to improve the classification effectiveness and the efficiency of CNN models training with limited images. Then in stage two the output of these models are aggregates using soft voting to boost the final prediction. The experimental results show the preprocessing is quite effective, the performance of transfer learning models perform better than the basic CNN model, and our ensemble model outperforms the single model as well as traditional methods, including the TNM staging system and the Radiomics method. Finally, the prediction accuracy boosted by the framework is, respectively, 0.81, indicating that our method achieves the SOTA effectiveness for LA-NPC stage prediction. In addition, the heatmaps generated with Class Activation Map technique illustrate the interpretability of the CNN models, and show their capability of assisting clinicians in medical diagnosis and follow-up treatment by producing discriminative regions related to NPC in the MR images.

AB  - Background: The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is a cornerstone in neurological assessment, providing critical insights into consciousness levels in patients with traumatic brain injuries and other neurological conditions. Despite its clinical importance, traditional methods for predicting GCS scores often fail to capture the complex, multi-dimensional nature of patient data. This study aims to address this gap by leveraging machine learning (ML) techniques to develop accurate, interpretable models for GCS prediction, enhancing decision making in critical care. Methods: A comprehensive dataset of 759 patients, encompassing 25 features spanning pre-, intra-, and post-operative stages, was used to develop predictive models. The dataset included key variables such as cognitive impairments, Hunt and Hess scores, and aneurysm dimensions. Six ML algorithms, including random forest (RF), XGBoost, and artificial neural networks (ANN), were trained and rigorously evaluated. Data preprocessing involved numerical encoding, standardization, and stratified splitting into training and validation subsets. Model performance was assessed using accuracy and receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC) metrics. Results: The RF model achieved the highest accuracy (86.4%) and mean ROC AUC (0.9592 +/- 0.0386, standard deviation), highlighting its robustness and reliability in handling heterogeneous clinical datasets. XGBoost and SVM models also demonstrated strong performance (ROC AUC = 0.9502 and 0.9462, respectively). Key predictors identified included the Hunt and Hess score, aneurysm dimensions, and post-operative factors such as prolonged intubation. Ensemble methods outperformed simpler models, such as K-nearest neighbors (KNN), which struggled with high-dimensional data. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the transformative potential of ML in GCS prediction, offering accurate and interpretable tools that go beyond traditional methods. By integrating advanced algorithms with clinically relevant features, this work provides a dynamic, data-driven framework for critical care decision making. The findings lay the groundwork for future advancements, including multi-modal data integration and broader validation, positioning ML as a vital tool in personalized neurological care.

AB  - The identification of important proteins is critical for the medical diagnosis and prognosis of common diseases. Diverse sets of computational tools have been developed for omics data reduction and protein selection. However, standard statistical models with single-feature selection involve the multi-testing burden of low power with limited available samples. Furthermore, high correlations among proteins with high redundancy and moderate effects often lead to unstable selections and cause reproducibility issues. Ensemble feature selection in machine learning (ML) may identify a stable set of disease biomarkers that could improve the prediction performance of subsequent classification models and thereby simplify their interpretability. In this study, we developed a three-stage homogeneous ensemble feature selection (HEFS) approach for both identifying proteins and improving prediction accuracy. This approach was implemented and applied to ovarian cancer proteogenomics datasets comprising (1) binary putative homologous recombination deficiency (HRD)- positive or -negative samples; (2) multiple mRNA classes (differentiated, proliferative, immunoreactive, mesenchymal, and unknown samples). We conducted and compared various ML methods with HEFS including random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and neural network (NN) for predicting both binary and multiple-class outcomes. The results indicated that the prediction accuracies varied for both binary and multiple-class classifications using various ML approaches with the proposed HEFS method. RF and NN provided better prediction accuracies than simple Naive Bayes or logistic models. For binary outcomes, with a sample size of 122 and nine selected prediction proteins using our proposed three-stage HEFS approach, the best ensemble ML (Treebag) achieved 83% accuracy, 85% sensitivity, and 81% specificity. For multiple (five)-class outcomes, the proposed HEFS-selected proteins combined with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in NN resulted in prediction accuracies for multiple-class classifications ranging from 75% to 96% for each of the five classes. Despite the different prediction accuracies of the various models, HEFS identified consistent sets of proteins linked to the binary and multiple-class outcomes.

AB  - The detection of brain tumours presents a significant challenge in the medical domain, where prompt and precise diagnosis is crucial as patient outcomes depend on it. Conventional deep neural networks perform well in carrying out various imaging tasks within the healthcare sector; however, their effectiveness often falls short of expectations in practical applications due to the substantial computational resources required and issues with reliability. In this research, an optimised and effective deep learning model founded on the DenseNet-169 architecture is introduced for the classification of magnetic resonance imaging brain tumours, which is particularly advantageous for smart healthcare systems and information and communication technology (ICT) settings with limited computational capabilities. The model compression methodologies, including pruning and quantization, have been employed to significantly diminish the dimensions and intricacy of the model while achieving a classification accuracy of 97.07%. Furthermore, this endeavour necessitates the enhancement of the model's interpretability through the utilisation of explainable artificial intelligence methodologies such as Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), which will aid clinicians in highlighting crucial areas of the images and validating feature importance concerning the decisions rendered by the model. A comparative performance evaluation is conducted against DenseNet-169, ResNet-50 and various other models to delineate the superior efficacy of our model, rendering it exceptionally adept for knowledge-driven, real-time brain tumour diagnosis within smart healthcare and ICT systems where resources are constrained.

TI  - Saliency-driven explainable deep learning in medical imaging: bridging visual explainability and statistical quantitative analysis
T2  - BIODATA MINING
LA  - English
AB  - Deep learning shows great promise for medical image analysis but often lacks explainability, hindering its adoption in healthcare. Attribution techniques that explain model reasoning can potentially increase trust in deep learning among clinical stakeholders. In the literature, much of the research on attribution in medical imaging focuses on visual inspection rather than statistical quantitative analysis.In this paper, we proposed an image-based saliency framework to enhance the explainability of deep learning models in medical image analysis. We use adaptive path-based gradient integration, gradient-free techniques, and class activation mapping along with its derivatives to attribute predictions from brain tumor MRI and COVID-19 chest X-ray datasets made by recent deep convolutional neural network models.The proposed framework integrates qualitative and statistical quantitative assessments, employing Accuracy Information Curves (AICs) and Softmax Information Curves (SICs) to measure the effectiveness of saliency methods in retaining critical image information and their correlation with model predictions. Visual inspections indicate that methods such as ScoreCAM, XRAI, GradCAM, and GradCAM++ consistently produce focused and clinically interpretable attribution maps. These methods highlighted possible biomarkers, exposed model biases, and offered insights into the links between input features and predictions, demonstrating their ability to elucidate model reasoning on these datasets. Empirical evaluations reveal that ScoreCAM and XRAI are particularly effective in retaining relevant image regions, as reflected in their higher AUC values. However, SICs highlight variability, with instances of random saliency masks outperforming established methods, emphasizing the need for combining visual and empirical metrics for a comprehensive evaluation.The results underscore the importance of selecting appropriate saliency methods for specific medical imaging tasks and suggest that combining qualitative and quantitative approaches can enhance the transparency, trustworthiness, and clinical adoption of deep learning models in healthcare. This study advances model explainability to increase trust in deep learning among healthcare stakeholders by revealing the rationale behind predictions. Future research should refine empirical metrics for stability and reliability, include more diverse imaging modalities, and focus on improving model explainability to support clinical decision-making.

AB  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in various domains, such as face recognition, object detection, and image segmentation. However, the lack of transparency and limited interpretability inherent in CNNs pose challenges in fields such as medical diagnosis, autonomous driving, finance, and military applications. Several studies have explored the interpretability of CNNs and proposed various post-hoc interpretable methods. The majority of these methods are feature-based, focusing on the influence of input variables on outputs. Few methods undertake the analysis of parameters in CNNs and their overall structure. To explore the structure of CNNs and intuitively comprehend the role of their internal parameters, we propose an Attribution Graph-based Interpretable method for CNNs (AGIC) which models the overall structure of CNNs as graphs and provides interpretability from global and local perspectives. The runtime parameters of CNNs and feature maps of each image sample are applied to construct attribution graphs (At-GCs), where the convolutional kernels are represented as nodes and the SHAP values between kernel outputs are assigned as edges. These At-GCs are then employed to pretrain a newly designed heterogeneous graph encoder based on Deep Graph Infomax (DGI). To comprehensively delve into the overall structure of CNNs, the pretrained encoder is used for two types of interpretable tasks: (1) a classifier is attached to the pretrained encoder for the classification of At-GCs, revealing the dependency of At-GC's topological characteristics on the image sample categories, and (2) a scoring aggregation (SA) network is constructed to assess the importance of each node in At-GCs, thus reflecting the relative importance of kernels in CNNs. The experimental results indicate that the topological characteristics of At-GC exhibit a dependency on the sample category used in its construction, which reveals that kernels in CNNs show distinct combined activation patterns for processing different image categories, meanwhile, the kernels that receive high scores from SA network are crucial for feature extraction, whereas low-scoring kernels can be pruned without affecting model performance, thereby enhancing the interpretability of CNNs.

AB  - Background Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is a common endocrine malignancy with rising incidence and frequent recurrence, despite a generally favorable prognosis. Accurate recurrence prediction is critical for guiding post-treatment strategies. This study aimed to enhance predictive performance by refining feature engineering and evaluating a diverse ensemble of machine learning models using the UCI DTC dataset.
   Methods Unsupervised data engineering-specifically dimensionality reduction and clustering-was used to improve feature quality. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (t-SVD) were selected based on superior clustering metrics: adjusted Rand Index (ARI > 0.55) and V-measure (> 0.45). These were integrated into classification pipelines using Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Feedforward Neural Network (FNN), and Gradient Boosting (GB). Model performance was evaluated through bootstrapping on an independent test set, stratified 10-fold cross-validation (CV), and subgroup analyses. Metrics included balanced accuracy, F1 score, AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and precision, each reported with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). SHAP analysis supported model interpretability.
   Results The PCA-based LR pipeline achieved the best test set performance: balanced accuracy of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.90-0.99), AUC of 0.99 (95% CI: 0.97-1.00), and sensitivity of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.84-1.00). In stratified CV, it maintained strong results (balanced accuracy: 0.86; AUC: 0.97; sensitivity: 0.80), with consistent performance across clinically relevant subgroups. The t-SVD-based LR pipeline showed comparable performance on both test and CV sets. SVM and FNN pipelines also performed robustly (test AUCs > 0.99; CV AUCs > 0.96). RF and KNN had high specificity but slightly lower sensitivity (test: similar to 0.87; CV: 0.77-0.80). GB pipelines showed the lowest overall performance (test balanced accuracy: 0.86-0.88; CV: 0.85-0.88).
   Conclusions Dimensionality reduction via PCA and t-SVD significantly improved model performance, particularly for LR, SVM, FNN, RF and KNN classifiers. The PCA-based LR pipeline showed the best generalizability, supporting its potential integration into clinical decision-support tools for personalized DTC management.

AB  - Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFUs) are a critical healthcare issue requiring early detection. Although deep learning models show promise in DFU diagnosis, their large parameter sizes and high computational demands limit their practical use. This work addresses these challenges by introducing DFU-LWNet, a lightweight, knowledge- distilled model that maintains or even surpasses the performance of existing models while drastically reducing computing costs. The DFU-LWNet model synergistically integrates the MBConv Block, leveraging its capabilities in feature expansion, depthwise convolution for parameter efficiency, and adaptive feature recalibration through the Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) mechanism. The methodology commences with the fine-tuning of seven pre- trained models, ultimately selecting InceptionV3 as the optimal teacher model based on experimental results. Subsequently, knowledge distillation (KD) is applied, leveraging the insights from this robust teacher model to enhance the performance of the student model, DFU-LWNet. The primary objective is to reduce the student model's parameter size and computational complexity while maintaining diagnostic accuracy. Through comprehensive evaluations, DFU-LWNet achieves an impressive classification accuracy of 96.23 % on a publicly available dataset comprising 1055 foot images. Notably, this achievement is accomplished with a remarkably low parameter size of only 0.49 million, consuming 2MB of disk space. This reduction in parameter size not only improves inference speed but also significantly reduces computational costs compared to pre-trained models. Moreover, the study employs Grad-CAM visualizations to demonstrate the model's enhanced saliency and interpretability in predictions post-KD, thereby offering valuable insights to clinicians. Additionally, the efficacy of DFU-LWNet extends to thermal imagery domains, as validated by experiments on a diverse dataset of thermal images of diabetic foot cases. The proposed approach achieves remarkable accuracy of 93.13% on a separate thermal image dataset, demonstrating cross-domain success and reinforcing the model's practical utility in real- world scenarios. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, this work demonstrates promising practical viability. DFU-LWNet's minimal parameter count and low prediction times make it well-suited for deployment in resource-limited healthcare settings.

AB  - Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), cataract, diabetic retinopathy (DR) and glaucoma are the four most common ocular conditions that lead to vision loss. Early detection in asymptomatic stages is necessary to alleviate vision loss. Manual diagnosis is costly, tedious, laborious and burdensome; assistive tools such as computer aided diagnosis (CAD) systems can help to alleviate these issues. Existing CAD systems for ocular diseases primarily address a single disease condition, employing disease-specific algorithms that rely on anatomical and morphological characteristics for localization of regions of interest (ROIs). The dependence on exhaustive image processing algorithms for pre-processing, ROI detection and feature extraction often results in overly complex systems prone to errors that affect classifier performance. Conglomerating many such individual diagnostic frameworks, each targeting a single disease, is not a practical solution for detecting multiple ocular diseases, especially in mass screening. Alternatively, a single generic CAD framework modeled as a multiclass problem serves to be useful in such high throughput scenarios, significantly reducing cost, time and manpower. Nevertheless, ambiguities in the overlapping features of multiple classes representing different diseases should be effectively addressed. This paper proposes a segmentation-independent approach based on deep learning (DL) to realize a single framework for the detection of different ocular conditions. The proposed work alleviates the need for pixel-level operations and segmentation techniques specific to different ocular diseases, offering a solution that has an upper hand compared to conventional systems in terms of complexity and accuracy. Further, explainability is incorporated as a value-addition that assures trust and confidence in the model. The system involves automatic feature extraction from full fundus images using Xception, a pre-trained deep model. Xception utilizes depthwise separable convolutions to capture subtle patterns in fundus images, effectively addressing the similarities between clinical indicators, such as drusen in AMD and exudates in DR, which often lead to misdiagnosis. A random over-sampling technique is performed to address class imbalance by equalizing the number of training samples across the classes. These features are fed to extreme gradient boosting (XGB) for classification. This study further aims to unveil the "black box" paradigm of model classification, by leveraging gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) technique to highlight relevant ROIs. The combination of Xception based feature extraction and XGB classification results in 99.31% accuracy, 99.5% sensitivity, 99.8% specificity, 99.4% F1-score and 99.4% precision. The proposed system can be a promising tool aiding conventional manual screening in primary health care centres and mass screening scenarios for efficiently diagnosing multiple ocular diseases, enhancing personalized and remote eye care, particularly in resource-limited settings. By combining objective performance metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity with subjective Grad- CAM visualizations, the system offers a comprehensive evaluation framework, ensuring transparency and building trust in ocular healthcare, making it well-suited for clinical adoption.

AB  - Drug combinations have demonstrated great potential in cancer treatments. They alleviate drug resistance and improve therapeutic efficacy. The fast-growing number of anti-cancer drugs has caused the experimental investigation of all drug combinations to become costly and time-consuming. Computational techniques can improve the efficiency of drug combination screening. Despite recent advances in applying machine learning to synergistic drug combination prediction, several challenges remain. First, the performance of existing methods is suboptimal. There is still much space for improvement. Second, biological knowledge has not been fully incorporated into the model. Finally, many models are lack interpretability, limiting their clinical applications. To address these challenges, we have developed a knowledge-enabled and self-attention transformer boosted deep learning model, TranSynergy, which improves the performance and interpretability of synergistic drug combination prediction. TranSynergy is designed so that the cellular effect of drug actions can be explicitly modeled through cell-line gene dependency, gene-gene interaction, and genome-wide drug-target interaction. A novel Shapley Additive Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (SA-GSEA) method has been developed to deconvolute genes that contribute to the synergistic drug combination and improve model interpretability. Extensive benchmark studies demonstrate that TranSynergy outperforms the state-of-the-art method, suggesting the potential of mechanism-driven machine learning. Novel pathways that are associated with the synergistic combinations are revealed and supported by experimental evidence. They may provide new insights into identifying biomarkers for precision medicine and discovering new anti-cancer therapies. Several new synergistic drug combinations have been predicted with high confidence for ovarian cancer which has few treatment options. The code is available at .
   Author summary
   The number of anti-cancer drugs has been consistently and quickly growing. They are mainly used as standardized mono-therapy. Drug combinations show substantial advantages over the anti-cancer mono-therapy. Cancer cells treated with the mono-therapy could later activate bypassing pathways and harbor drug resistances. Drug combinations can alleviate this issue by using a smaller doses of each anti-cancer drug or targeting multiple oncogenic pathways. However, the investigation of all anti-cancer drug combinations using experimental methods is costly and time-consuming. Machine learning provides an attractive solution to screening synergistic drug combinations, but it is a black-box and not easy to explain. We have developed a knowledge-enabled deep learning model, TranSynergy, to predict synergistic drug combinations and have demonstrated that our model outperformed other state-of-the-art methods. A novel Shapley Additive Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (SA-GSEA) method is introduced to improve the interpretability of the machine learning model. Using TransSynergy and SA-GSEA, we can deconvolute genes responsible for the synergistic drug combination, suggesting the potential of machine learning in developing precision anti-cancer therapy.

AB  - Objectives Herbal prescription recommendation (HPR) is a hot topic and challenging issue in field of clinical decision support of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). However, almost all previous HPR methods have not adhered to the clinical principles of syndrome differentiation and treatment planning of TCM, which has resulted in suboptimal performance and difficulties in application to real-world clinical scenarios.Materials and Methods We emphasize the synergy among diagnosis and treatment procedure in real-world TCM clinical settings to propose the PresRecST model, which effectively combines the key components of symptom collection, syndrome differentiation, treatment method determination, and herb recommendation. This model integrates a self-curated TCM knowledge graph to learn the high-quality representations of TCM biomedical entities and performs 3 stages of clinical predictions to meet the principle of systematic sequential procedure of TCM decision making.Results To address the limitations of previous datasets, we constructed the TCM-Lung dataset, which is suitable for the simultaneous training of the syndrome differentiation, treatment method determination, and herb recommendation. Overall experimental results on 2 datasets demonstrate that the proposed PresRecST outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm by significant improvements (eg, improvements of P@5 by 4.70%, P@10 by 5.37%, P@20 by 3.08% compared with the best baseline).Discussion The workflow of PresRecST effectively integrates the embedding vectors of the knowledge graph for progressive recommendation tasks, and it closely aligns with the actual diagnostic and treatment procedures followed by TCM doctors. A series of ablation experiments and case study show the availability and interpretability of PresRecST, indicating the proposed PresRecST can be beneficial for assisting the diagnosis and treatment in real-world TCM clinical settings.Conclusion Our technology can be applied in a progressive recommendation scenario, providing recommendations for related items in a progressive manner, which can assist in providing more reliable diagnoses and herbal therapies for TCM clinical task.

AB  - Objective: While clinical Artificial Intelligence (cAI) mortality prediction models and relevant studies have increased, limitations including the lack of external validation studies and inadequate model calibration leading to decreased overall accuracy have been observed. To combat this, we developed and evaluated a novel deep neural network (DNN) and a validation framework to promote transparent cAI development.
   Methods: Data from Japan's largest ICU database was used to develop the DNN model, predicting in-hospital mortality including ICU and post-ICU mortality by days since ICU discharge. The most important variables to the model were extracted with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to examine the DNN's efficacy as well as develop models that were also externally validated.
   Main results: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for predicting ICU mortality was 0.94 [0.93-0.95], and 0.91 [0.90-0.92] for in-hospital mortality, ranging between 0.91-0.95 throughout one year since ICU discharge. An external validation using only the top 20 variables resulted with higher AUCs than traditional severity scores.
   Conclusions: Our DNN model consistently generated AUCs between 0.91-0.95 regardless of days since ICU discharge. The 20 most important variables to our DNN, also generated higher AUCs than traditional severity scores regardless of days since ICU discharge. To our knowledge, this is the first study that predicts ICU and in-hospital mortality using cAI by post-ICU discharge days up to over a year. This finding could contribute to increased transparency on cAI applications. (C) 2022 Societe francaise d'anesthesie et de reanimation (Sfar). Published by Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aims/Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted the need for accurate and efficient diagnostic methods. This study aims to improve COVID-19 detection by integrating chest X-ray (CXR) and computerized tomography (CT) images using deep learning techniques, further improving diagnostic accuracy by using a combined imaging approach. Methods The study used two publicly accessible databases, COVID-19 Questionnaires for Understanding the Exposure (COVID-QU-Ex) and Integrated Clinical and Translational Cancer Foundation (iCTCF), containing CXR and CT images, respectively. The proposed system employed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for classification, specifically EfficientNet and ResNet architectures. The data underwent preprocessing steps, including image resizing, Gaussian noise addition, and data augmentation. The dataset was divided into training, validation, and test sets. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was used for model interpretability. Results The EfficientNet-based models outperformed the ResNet-based models across all metrics. The highest accuracy achieved was 99.44% for CXR images and 99.81% for CT images with EfficientNetB5. The models also demonstrated high precision, recall, and F1 scores. For statistical significance, the pvalues were less than 0.05, indicating that the results are significant. Conclusion Integrating CXR and CT images using deep learning significantly improves the accuracy of COVID-19 diagnosis. The EfficientNet-based models, with their superior feature extraction capabilities, show better performance than ResNet models. Grad-CAM Visualizations provide insights into the model's decision-making process, potentially reducing diagnostic errors and accelerating diagnosis processes. This approach can improve patient care and support healthcare systems in managing the pandemic more effectively.

AB  - With the rapid growth of healthcare data and the need for secure, interpretable, and decentralized machine learning systems, Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution. However, FL models often face challenges regarding privacy preservation, transparency, and resistance to adversarial attacks. To address these limitations, this paper proposes the Privacy Preserving Federated Blockchain Explainable Artificial Intelligence Optimization (PPFBXAIO) framework, which integrates blockchain technology, Explainable AI (XAI), and optimization techniques to ensure privacy, traceability, and robustness in FL-based systems. PPFBXAIO employs Secure Hash Algorithm 256 (SHA-256) for blockchain-backed secure model updates, Min-Max normalization for feature scaling, and the Levy Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (LGOA) for optimal feature selection and federated model tuning. The Entropy Deep Belief Network (EDBN) is used as the classifier to enhance classification accuracy and detect attacks. XAI tools like SHAP are utilized to improve model interpretability. Experimental validation was conducted using the Heart Disease dataset from Kaggle and the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. Results showed that PPFBXAIO achieved 95.07% accuracy, 95.44% precision, 96.54% recall, 95.98% F1 score, and reduced training loss by 4.93% for Breast Cancer Wisconsin and achieved 93.07% accuracy, 91.19% precision, 95.39% recall, 93.24% F1 score for Heart Disease dataset. Proposed system has reduced latency by 81 ms, and improved throughput by 109 transactions per second for 100 rounds as compared to traditional models like FedAvg, FL-MPC, FL-RAEC, and PEFL. These results highlight the framework's superior performance, privacy preservation, and practical applicability in decentralized healthcare AI systems.

AB  - Kidney tumors represent a significant medical challenge, characterized by their often-asymptomatic nature and the need for early detection to facilitate timely and effective intervention. Although neural networks have shown great promise in disease prediction, their computational demands have limited their practicality in clinical settings. This study introduces a novel methodology, the UNet-PWP architecture, tailored explicitly for kidney tumor segmentation, designed to optimize resource utilization and overcome computational complexity constraints. A key novelty in our approach is the application of adaptive partitioning, which deconstructs the intricate UNet architecture into smaller submodels. This partitioning strategy reduces computational requirements and enhances the model's efficiency in processing kidney tumor images. Additionally, we augment the UNet's depth by incorporating pre-trained weights, therefore significantly boosting its capacity to handle intricate and detailed segmentation tasks. Furthermore, we employ weight-pruning techniques to eliminate redundant zero-weighted parameters, further streamlining the UNet-PWP model without compromising its performance. To rigorously assess the effectiveness of our proposed UNet-PWP model, we conducted a comparative evaluation alongside the DeepLab V3+ model, both trained on the "KiTs 19, 21, and 23" kidney tumor dataset. Our results are optimistic, with the UNet-PWP model achieving an exceptional accuracy rate of 97.01% on both the training and test datasets, surpassing the DeepLab V3+ model in performance. Furthermore, to ensure our model's results are easily understandable and explainable. We included a fusion of the attention and Grad-CAM XAI methods. This approach provides valuable insights into the decision-making process of our model and the regions of interest that affect its predictions. In the medical field, this interpretability aspect is crucial for healthcare professionals to trust and comprehend the model's reasoning.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus is a prevalent chronic disease that impacts the metabolic system of an increasing number of individuals every year. Due to this persistent and rapid increase, hospitals worldwide face a significant global health burden. An advanced and accurate predictive system is essential to alleviate this increasing burden and enable early diagnosis and effective treatment. Existing predictive methods predominantly rely on traditional Artificial Intelligence (AI) models; however, these models often struggle to address challenges such as high feature complexity, data imbalance, non-linear pattern learning, and lack of interpretability. To address the significant class imbalance in the trustworthy and patient privacy-concious diabetes health indicator dataset, this study employs the proximity-weighted random affine shadow sampling technique, which reduces prediction bias by focusing on borderline instances. The point-biserial correlation coefficient is used to choose the most significant and important features from the dataset. To capture the complex relationships within the diabetes dataset, Deep Gated Network (DGNet), a novel Deep Learning (DL) model, is proposed. DGNet's architecture includes fully connected dense layers and a unique gating mechanism. The experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed DGNet performs significantly better than state-of-the-art logistic regression, support vector machines, decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, residual networks, long-short-term memory, multi-layer perceptrons, deep neural networks, highway networks, and deep belief networks. Compared to conventional models, DGNet achieves notable performance improvements, with gains of 11.4% in accuracy, 8.2 % in F1-score, 7.73% in recall, 9.13% in precision, 11.8% in receiver operating characteristics area under the curve, 12.22% in precision-recall area under the curve, and 40.54% reduction in log loss. The 10-fold cross validation technique is used to assess the DGNet's generalizability and reliability. Furthermore, advanced explainable AI techniques, Shapley additive explanations, and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations are employed to interpret the importance of features in early diabetes prediction. This study establishes the DGNet as an effective and interpretable approach for early-stage diabetes prediction, with the rising need for responsible AI solutions in healthcare, where transparency, trust, and data privacy have become necessary for patient-focused innovation.

AB  - Mental illness has grown to become a prevalent and global health concern that affects individuals across various demographics. Timely detection and accurate diagnosis of mental disorders are crucial for effective treatment and support as late diagnosis could result in suicidal, harmful behaviors and ultimately death. To this end, the present study introduces a novel pipeline for the analysis of facial expressions, leveraging both the AffectNet and 2013 Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) datasets. Consequently, this research goes beyond traditional diagnostic methods by contributing a system capable of generating a comprehensive mental disorder dataset and concurrently predicting mental disorders based on facial emotional cues. Particularly, we introduce a hybrid architecture for mental disorder detection leveraging the state-of-the-art object detection algorithm, YOLOv8 to detect and classify visual cues associated with specific mental disorders. To achieve accurate predictions, an integrated learning architecture based on the fusion of Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) and Visual Transformer (ViT) models is developed to form an ensemble classifier that predicts the presence of mental illness (e.g., depression, anxiety, and other mental disorder). The overall accuracy is improved to about 81% using the proposed ensemble technique. To ensure transparency and interpretability, we integrate techniques such as Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and saliency maps to highlight the regions in the input image that significantly contribute to the model's predictions thus providing healthcare professionals with a clear understanding of the features influencing the system's decisions thereby enhancing trust and more informed diagnostic process.

AB  - BackgroundLike other scientific fields, such as cosmology, high-energy physics, or even the life sciences, medicine and healthcare face the challenge of an extremely quick transformation into data-driven sciences. This challenge entails the daunting task of extracting usable knowledge from these data using algorithmic methods. In the medical context this may for instance realized through the design of medical decision support systems for diagnosis, prognosis and patient management. The intensive care unit (ICU), and by extension the whole area of critical care, is becoming one of the most data-driven clinical environments.ResultsThe increasing availability of complex and heterogeneous data at the point of patient attention in critical care environments makes the development of fresh approaches to data analysis almost compulsory. Computational Intelligence (CI) and Machine Learning (ML) methods can provide such approaches and have already shown their usefulness in addressing problems in this context. The current study has a dual goal: it is first a review of the state-of-the-art on the use and application of such methods in the field of critical care. Such review is presented from the viewpoint of the different subfields of critical care, but also from the viewpoint of the different available ML and CI techniques. The second goal is presenting a collection of results that illustrate the breath of possibilities opened by ML and CI methods using a single problem, the investigation of septic shock at the ICU.ConclusionWe have presented a structured state-of-the-art that illustrates the broad-ranging ways in which ML and CI methods can make a difference in problems affecting the manifold areas of critical care. The potential of ML and CI has been illustrated in detail through an example concerning the sepsis pathology. The new definitions of sepsis and the relevance of using the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in its diagnosis have been considered. Conditional independence models have been used to address this problem, showing that SIRS depends on both organ dysfunction measured through the Sequential Organ Failure (SOFA) score and the ICU outcome, thus concluding that SIRS should still be considered in the study of the pathophysiology of Sepsis. Current assessment of the risk of dead at the ICU lacks specificity. ML and CI techniques are shown to improve the assessment using both indicators already in place and other clinical variables that are routinely measured. Kernel methods in particular are shown to provide the best performance balance while being amenable to representation through graphical models, which increases their interpretability and, with it, their likelihood to be accepted in medical practice.

AB  - Deep learning (DL) has had an incredible influence on many different scientific areas over the past couple of decades. Particularly in the field of healthcare, DL strategies were able to outclass other existing methodologies in image processing. The rapid expansion of the monkeypox endemic to over 40 nations apart from Africa has prompted serious worries in the realm of public health. Given that monkeypox can have symptoms that are akin to both chickenpox and measles, early detection can be difficult. Fortunately, due to the developments in artificial intelligence approaches, it can be implemented to promptly and accurately identify monkeypox disease using visual data information. Many DL driven techniques have already been exploited in the literature for skin related issues, which have provided accurate results to some extent. These models were dependent on extensive computational and time resources due to which the real-time applicability is difficult. Rather of building and training CNNs from scratch, this study uses transfer learning (TL) technique to fine-tune pre-trained networks, particularly exploiting various versions of ConvNeXt, by substituting last layer with additional task specific ones. A number of pre-processing and data augmentation methods have also been assessed and adjusted with regard to computing time and performance. The proposed study performs the binary and multi class monkeypox disease classification task. Promising accurate results of 99.9 % on the benchmark MSLD (binary class) dataset and 94 % on the MSLD v2.0 (multi-class) dataset is obtained by fine-tuned TL-based ConvNeXtSmall and ConvNeXtBase architecture with Adafactor optimization technique, demonstrating the practicality of the suggested framework as a substitute for the current ones. The proposed model is assessed through both standard train-test split and kfold cross validation techniques. Furthermore, performance of models is also assessed on several other metrics including recall, F1 score, precision and multiple statistical tests incorporated with explainable AI methods for better interpretability of results. The concerns regarding the real-time applicability are tackled by utilizing the less time consuming and computationally efficient networks through the exploitation of transfer learning capabilities. Moreover, the explainable findings of the proposed study will be highly valuable for the healthcare professionals to understand the decisive behavior of the model and make informed clinical decisions.

AB  - Machine learning has achieved remarkable success across diverse domains. Nevertheless, concerns about interpretability in black-box models, especially within Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), have become pronounced in safety-critical fields like healthcare and finance. Classical machine learning (ML) classifiers, known for their higher interpretability, are preferred in these domains. Similar to DNNs, classical ML classifiers can exhibit bugs that could lead to severe consequences in practice. Test input prioritization has emerged as a promising approach to ensure the quality of an ML system, which prioritizes potentially misclassified tests so that such tests can be identified earlier with limited manual labeling costs. However, when applying to classical ML classifiers, existing DNN test prioritization methods are constrained from three perspectives: 1) Coverage-based methods are inefficient and time-consuming; 2) Mutation-based methods cannot be adapted to classical ML models due to mismatched model mutation rules; 3) Confidence-based methods are restricted to a single dimension when applying to binary ML classifiers, solely depending on the model's prediction probability for one class. To overcome the challenges, we propose MLPrior, a test prioritization approach specifically tailored for classical ML models. MLPrior leverages the characteristics of classical ML classifiers (i.e., interpretable models and carefully engineered attribute features) to prioritize test inputs. The foundational principles are: 1) tests more sensitive to mutations are more likely to be misclassified, and 2) tests closer to the model's decision boundary are more likely to be misclassified. Building on the first concept, we design mutation rules to generate two types of mutation features (i.e., model mutation features and input mutation features) for each test. Drawing from the second notion, MLPrior generates attribute features of each test based on its attribute values, which can indirectly reveal the proximity between the test and the decision boundary. For each test, MLPrior combines all three types of features of it into a final vector. Subsequently, MLPrior employs a pre-trained ranking model to predict the misclassification probability of each test based on its final vector and ranks tests accordingly. We conducted an extensive study to evaluate MLPrior based on 185 subjects, encompassing natural datasets, mixed noisy datasets, and fairness datasets. The results demonstrate that MLPrior outperforms all the compared test prioritization approaches, with an average improvement of 14.74%similar to similar to 66.93% on natural datasets, 18.55%similar to similar to 67.73% on mixed noisy datasets, and 15.34%similar to similar to 62.72% on fairness datasets.

AB  - In today's generation, many healthcare organizations moving towards patient-centred quality assessment, transparency strategies, and practices. Therefore, online reviews are the part of everyday life and millions of online reviews being generated daily; unfortunately, all online reviews are not genuine do happen negative reviews written by malicious users are everywhere on the social media platform such as Google, Yelp, Facebook, TripAdvisor, Amazon, Healthgrades, etc. Every fake, spam, and negative online review can directly impact a potential customer's purchasing decision, company's reputation, profitability and misleading the consumers, and damage the reputation of review websites. Hence, detecting fake online reviews has become a big challenge in the rapid development of e-commerce but it can be more dangerous when it comes to medical products, e-healthcare platforms to classify online reviews correctly due to the high false-positive rate (FPR) and the false-negative rate (FNR). In the medical environment, trust is the best reason to pursue transparency and deserve their confidence then patients have made online reviews an integral part of their decision-making process. Patient online reviews and ratings can be a good indicator of clinical effectiveness, efficiently control their health and patient safety. Researchers performed various investigations to predict fake online reviews, and their models could have provided low prediction accuracy due to the selection of lesser features and lack of essential prediction labels. To handle this issue, this paper presents an efficient approach to specifically predict fake online reviews with multiple feature analyses in an automated way with different perspectives of patient safety using qualitative methods. The primary aim of this paper is to provide a solid and complete comparative study of present research on detecting fake online reviews designed a deep learning index system to examine multiple features such as sentiment, test, and behaviour features of the online reviewers. The input samples are trained with the novel dense network model to extract essential features. And the labels are provided tentatively, and the model adopts some initial samples to train the proposed classifier model as the model intends to give better accuracy. The model's novelty relies on the feature selection and label classification of reviews. The experimental results indicated that fake review detection yields better accuracy of 99.5% on the anticipated model than other baseline approaches across the Amazon and medical datasets, using deep learning techniques to reduce the FPR, and FNR then improves fake review detection capabilities. The proposed model significantly improved the classifier's performance compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques in the Amazon and medical domains, demonstrating the effectiveness and relevance of the method.

AB  - The prevalence of brain tumor disorders is currently a global issue. In general, radiography, which includes a large number of images, is an efficient method for diagnosing these life-threatening disorders. The biggest issue in this area is that it takes a radiologist a long time and is physically strenuous to look at all the images. As a result, research into developing systems based on machine learning to assist radiologists in diagnosis continues to rise daily. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), one type of deep learning approach, have been pivotal in achieving state-of-the-art results in several medical imaging applications, including the identification of brain tumors. CNN hyperparameters are typically set manually for segmentation and classification, which might take a while and increase the chance of using suboptimal hyperparameters for both tasks. Bayesian optimization is a useful method for updating the deep CNN's optimal hyperparameters. The CNN network, however, can be considered a "black box" model because of how difficult it is to comprehend the information it stores because of its complexity. Therefore, this problem can be solved by using Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) tools, which provide doctors with a realistic explanation of CNN's assessments. Implementation of deep learning-based systems in real-time diagnosis is still rare. One of the causes could be that these methods don't quantify the Uncertainty in the predictions, which could undermine trust in the AI-based diagnosis of diseases. To be used in real-time medical diagnosis, CNN-based models must be realistic and appealing, and uncertainty needs to be evaluated. So, a novel three-phase strategy is proposed for segmenting and classifying brain tumors. Segmentation of brain tumors using the DeeplabV3+ model is first performed with tuning of hyperparameters using Bayesian optimization. For classification, features from state-of-the-art deep learning models Darknet53 and mobilenetv2 are extracted and fed to SVM for classification, and hyperparameters of SVM are also optimized using a Bayesian approach. The second step is to understand whatever portion of the images CNN uses for feature extraction using XAI algorithms. Using confusion entropy, the Uncertainty of the Bayesian optimized classifier is finally quantified. Based on a Bayesian-optimized deep learning framework, the experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms earlier techniques, achieving a 97% classification accuracy and a 0.98 global accuracy.

AB  - Background and Objective: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) refers to self-reported difficulties in concentration, memory, and decision-making. Since SCD is based on subjective experiences, no specific medical test can definitively confirm its presence, making early detection challenging. Thus, it is advantageous to develop an AI model to capitalize on self-reported health complications, personality traits, and sociodemographic factors for early detection of SCD. Methods & Materials: This research has proposed an AI-based framework for SCD detection using self- reported measures from the BRFSS 2021 dataset. A novel Weighted Fusion Selection (WFS) approach has been introduced, which combines multiple feature selection techniques to address class imbalance and identify relevant features associated with less frequent classes. The data set has shown a significant imbalance, with individuals at risk of SCD being 81.76% fewer than those not at risk. An Attention Cost Convolutional Neural Network (AC-CNN) has been developed to address this, integrating channel-wise attention mechanisms and cost-sensitive learning to enhance performance across imbalanced data. Results: The AC-CNN model has achieved a balance between specificity (77%) and sensitivity (81%), with an AUC-ROC of 0.87. This has represented an overall 24.8% improvement in handling class imbalance compared to prior studies. Additional testing on the NHIS 2022 dataset has shown that AC-CNN has maintained balanced performance, confirming its robust generalizability, while other models have remained unstable. Conclusions: Further, applying SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) explainable techniques to the AC-CNN model has revealed how individual aspects of an individual's health records, lifestyle, and demographics contribute to the prediction of SCD. For example, depression, low education, poor income, inadequate healthcare, and poor overall health have all been strongly linked to an increased risk of SCD.

AB  - Video capsule endoscopy (VCE) is a revolutionary technology for the early diagnosis of gastric disorders. However, owing to the high redundancy and subtle manifestation of anomalies among thousands of frames, the manual construal of VCE videos requires considerable patience, focus, and time. The automatic analysis of these videos using computational methods is a challenge as the capsule is un-tamed in motion and captures frames inaptly. Several machine learning (ML) methods, including recent deep convolutional neural networks approaches, have been adopted after evaluating their potential of improving the VCE analysis. However, the clinical impact of these methods is yet to be investigated. This survey aimed to highlight the gaps between existing ML-based research methodologies and clinically significant rules recently established by gastroenterologists based on VCE. A framework for interpreting raw frames into contextually relevant frame-level findings and subsequently merging these findings with meta-data to obtain a disease-level diagnosis was formulated. Frame-level findings can be more intelligible for discriminative learning when organized in a taxonomical hierarchy. The proposed taxonomical hierarchy, which is formulated based on pathological and visual similarities, may yield better classification metrics by setting inference classes at a higher level than training classes. Mapping from the frame level to the disease level was structured in the form of a graph based on clinical relevance inspired by the recent international consensus developed by domain experts. Furthermore, existing methods for VCE summarization, classification, segmentation, detection, and localization were critically evaluated and compared based on aspects deemed significant by clinicians. Numerous studies pertain to single anomaly detection instead of a pragmatic approach in a clinical setting. The challenges and opportunities associated with VCE analysis were delineated. A focus on maximizing the discriminative power of features corresponding to various subtle lesions and anomalies may help cope with the diverse and mimicking nature of different VCE frames. Large multicenter datasets must be created to cope with data sparsity, bias, and class imbalance. Explainability, reliability, traceability, and transparency are important for an ML-based diagnostics system in a VCE. Existing ethical and legal bindings narrow the scope of possibilities where ML can potentially be leveraged in healthcare. Despite these limitations, ML based video capsule endoscopy will revolutionize clinical practice, aiding clinicians in rapid and accurate diagnosis.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Patient Similarity Network paradigm implies modeling the similarity between patients based on specific data. The similarity can summarize patients' relationships from high-dimensional data, such as biological omics. The end PSN can undergo un/supervised learning tasks while being strongly interpretable, tailored for precision medicine, and ready to be analyzed with graph-theory methods. However, these benefits are not guaranteed and depend on the granularity of the summarized data, the clarity of the similarity measure, the complexity of the network's topology, and the implemented methods for analysis. To date, no patient classifier fully leverages the paradigm's inherent benefits. PSNs remain complex, unexploited, and meaningless. We present StellarPath, a hierarchical-vertical patient classifier that leverages pathway analysis and patient similarity concepts to find meaningful features for both classes and individuals. StellarPath processes omics data, hierarchically integrates them into pathways, and uses a novel similarity to measure how patients' pathway activity is alike. It selects biologically relevant molecules, pathways, and networks, considering molecule stability and topology. A graph convolutional neural network then predicts unknown patients based on known cases. StellarPath excels in classification performances and computational resources across sixteen datasets. It demonstrates proficiency in inferring the class of new patients described in external independent studies, following its initial training and testing phases on a local dataset. It advances the PSN paradigm and provides new markers, insights, and tools for in-depth patient profiling.
   A clinician's decision-making process for diagnosing an unknown patient involves selecting properties where patients with the same condition are alike but distinct from others, creating a mental database of known patients linked by their similarities, and evaluating the condition of the unknown patient based on its similarities with those in the database. However, constructing a network from biological omics data, which profiles patients through thousands of molecules, poses a significant challenge. The network's quality hinges on the choice of the molecules used to determine the patients' similarities, the significance of the similarity measure, and the network's structure interpretability. StellarPath is a patient classifier based on patient similarity networks. It manages data normalization, molecule selection, and combines molecule types based on their interactions. It determines key cellular functions distinguishing patient classes and models how much two patients are similar based on how their cells regulate each function. It retains networks that group similar patients while separating different ones, using this data to predict unknown patients' outcomes. Tested on seventeen datasets, StellarPath has proven efficient and insightful. It pushes the patient similarity network paradigm forward, offers reliable markers, and provides new tools and insights for patient analysis.

AB  - Objectives Emerging systemic immune-inflammatory biomarkers demonstrate potential for predicting postoperative complications. This study develops machine learning models to assess the combined predictive value of Aggregate Index of Systemic Inflammation (AISI), Systemic Immune-Inflammation Index (SII), CRP-Albumin-Lymphocyte (CALLY) index and Subcutaneous Lumbar Spine Index (SLSI) for surgical site infection (SSI) following posterior lumbar spinal fusion.Methods This retrospective study analyzed 2,921 patients undergoing posterior lumbar spinal fusion at two tertiary hospitals in Guangxi (August 2017-January 2025). Data were partitioned into training (70%) and validation (30%) groups. Feature selection via univariate regression analysis identified predictive variables, followed by model development using ten machine learning algorithms: logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), gradient boosting machine (GBM), XGBoost, neural network, K-nearest neighbors(KNN), AdaBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. Hyperparameters were optimized with 10-fold cross-validation. The top seven performing models (assessed by AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1 scores) were integrated into a dynamic nomogram. Internal validation employed ROC analysis and calibration curves, while Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) values interpreted feature importance in the optimal model.Results Among 2,921 screened patients, 1,272 met inclusion criteria. Consensus feature selection across the seven top-performing ML algorithms identified AISI, SII, CALLY and SLSI as independent predictors of SSI. The derived nomogram demonstrated exceptional discrimination (training groups AUC = 0.966; C-index = 0.993, 95% CI 0.984-0.995) and excellent calibration. Additionally, the SHAP method emphasized the significance of AISI, SII, CALLY and SLSI as independent predictors influencing the machine learning model's predictions.Conclusion The AISI, SII, CALLY and SLSI emerged as independent predictors of SSI following posterior lumbar spinal fusion. Our machine learning-derived nomogram demonstrated high discriminative accuracy and clinical applicability through dynamic risk stratification. Leveraging the SHAP methodology enhances model interpretability, thereby empowering healthcare providers to proactively mitigate SSI occurrences and enhance overall patient outcomes.

AB  - Simple Summary Different chest diseases badly affect the human respiration system. The chest radiographs of the lungs are used to classify these diseases. Identifying diseases is essential, but the most important thing is explaining the reason behind classification results. This research provides an explanation of the classification results of different lung pulmonary diseases so that doctors can understand the reason that causes these diseases. This work achieved 97% classification accuracy. This research also evaluated the highlighted regions in the input image, during the explanation of classification results with the manifest file, where the doctor highlighted the same regions with red arrows. The automatic disease explanation and identification will help doctors to diagnose these diseases at a very early stage. Explainable Artificial Intelligence is a key component of artificially intelligent systems that aim to explain the classification results. The classification results explanation is essential for automatic disease diagnosis in healthcare. The human respiration system is badly affected by different chest pulmonary diseases. Automatic classification and explanation can be used to detect these lung diseases. In this paper, we introduced a CNN-based transfer learning-based approach for automatically explaining pulmonary diseases, i.e., edema, tuberculosis, nodules, and pneumonia from chest radiographs. Among these pulmonary diseases, pneumonia, which COVID-19 causes, is deadly; therefore, radiographs of COVID-19 are used for the explanation task. We used the ResNet50 neural network and trained the network on extensive training with the COVID-CT dataset and the COVIDNet dataset. The interpretable model LIME is used for the explanation of classification results. Lime highlights the input image's important features for generating the classification result. We evaluated the explanation using radiologists' highlighted images and identified that our model highlights and explains the same regions. We achieved improved classification results with our fine-tuned model with an accuracy of 93% and 97%, respectively. The analysis of our results indicates that this research not only improves the classification results but also provides an explanation of pulmonary diseases with advanced deep-learning methods. This research would assist radiologists with automatic disease detection and explanations, which are used to make clinical decisions and assist in diagnosing and treating pulmonary diseases in the early stage.

AB  - Background Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an early stage of cognitive decline which could develop into dementia. An early detection of MCI is a crucial step for timely prevention and intervention. Recent studies have developed deep learning models to detect MCI and dementia using a bedside task like the classic clock drawing test (CDT). However, it remains a challenge to predict the early stage of the disease using the CDT data alone. Moreover, the state-of-the-art deep learning techniques still face black box challenges, making it questionable to implement them in a clinical setting. Methods We recruited 918 subjects from King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital (651 healthy subjects and 267 MCI patients). We propose a novel deep learning framework that incorporates data from the CDT, cube-copying, and trail-making tests. Soft label and self-attention were applied to improve the model performance and provide a visual explanation. The interpretability of the visualization of our model and the Grad-CAM approach were rated by experienced medical personnel and quantitatively evaluated using intersection over union (IoU) between the models' heat maps and the regions of interest. Results Rather than using a single CDT image in the baseline VGG16 model, using multiple drawing tasks as inputs into our proposed model with soft label significantly improves the classification performance between the healthy aging controls and the MCI patients. In particular, the classification accuracy increases from 0.75 (baseline model) to 0.81. The F1-score increases from 0.36 to 0.65, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) increases from 0.74 to 0.84. Compared to the multi-input model that also offers interpretable visualization, i.e., Grad-CAM, our model receives higher interpretability scores given by experienced medical experts and higher IoUs. Conclusions Our model achieves better classification performance at detecting MCI compared to the baseline model. In addition, the model provides visual explanations that are superior to those of the baseline model as quantitatively evaluated by experienced medical personnel. Thus, our work offers an interpretable machine learning model with high classification performance, both of which are crucial aspects of artificial intelligence in medical diagnosis.

AB  - Simple Summary In the era of personalized medicine, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful tool with growing applications in the field of gynaecologic oncology. However, AI applications are encountered with several challenges derived from their "black-box" nature, which limits their adoption by clinicians. Surgical decision-making at cytoreductive surgery for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is a complex matter, and an accurate prediction of surgical effort is required to ensure the good health and care of patients. We combined high-performance AI modeling with an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) framework to explain feature effects and interactions associated with specific threshold surgical effort using data from a single public institution. We revealed features not routinely measured in the clinical practice, including human factors that could be responsible for the variation in the surgical effort. Selective decreased surgical effort may be associated with the surgeon's age. The use of XAI frameworks can provide actionable information for surgeons to improve patient outcomes in gynaecologic oncology. (1) Background: Surgical cytoreduction for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is a complex procedure. Encompassed within the performance skills to achieve surgical precision, intra-operative surgical decision-making remains a core feature. The use of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) could potentially interpret the influence of human factors on the surgical effort for the cytoreductive outcome in question; (2) Methods: The retrospective cohort study evaluated 560 consecutive EOC patients who underwent cytoreductive surgery between January 2014 and December 2019 in a single public institution. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Deep Neural Network (DNN) algorithms were employed to develop the predictive model, including patient- and operation-specific features, and novel features reflecting human factors in surgical heuristics. The precision, recall, F1 score, and area under curve (AUC) were compared between both training algorithms. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) framework was used to provide global and local explainability for the predictive model; (3) Results: A surgical complexity score (SCS) cut-off value of five was calculated using a Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve, above which the probability of incomplete cytoreduction was more likely (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.644; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.598-0.69; sensitivity and specificity 34.1%, 86.5%, respectively; p = 0.000). The XGBoost outperformed the DNN assessment for the prediction of the above threshold surgical effort outcome (AUC = 0.77; 95% [CI] 0.69-0.85; p < 0.05 vs. AUC 0.739; 95% [CI] 0.655-0.823; p < 0.95). We identified "turning points" that demonstrated a clear preference towards above the given cut-off level of surgical effort; in consultant surgeons with <12 years of experience, age <53 years old, who, when attempting primary cytoreductive surgery, recorded the presence of ascites, an Intraoperative Mapping of Ovarian Cancer score >4, and a Peritoneal Carcinomatosis Index >7, in a surgical environment with the optimization of infrastructural support. (4) Conclusions: Using XAI, we explain how intra-operative decisions may consider human factors during EOC cytoreduction alongside factual knowledge, to maximize the magnitude of the selected trade-off in effort.
   XAI techniques are critical for a better understanding of Artificial Intelligence frameworks, and to enhance their incorporation in medical applications.

TI  - Data-driven survival modeling for breast cancer prognostics: A comparative study with machine learning and traditional survival modeling methods
T2  - PLOS ONE

KW  - HEALTH-CARE
KW  - PREDICTION
AB  - Background This investigation delves into the potential application of data-driven survival modeling approaches for prognostic assessments of breast cancer survival. The primary objective is to evaluate and compare the ability of machine learning (ML) models and conventional survival analysis techniques, to identify consistent key predictors of breast cancer survival outcomes.Methods This study employs data-driven survival modeling approaches to predict breast cancer survival, including survival-specific methods such as the Cox Proportional Hazards (CPH) model, Random Survival Forests (RSF), and Cox Proportional Deep Neural Networks (DeepSurv), as well as machine learning models like Random Forests (RF), XGBoost, Support Vector Machines (SVM) with an RBF Kernel, and LightGBM. The dataset, sourced from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program, comprises 4,024 women diagnosed with infiltrating duct and lobular carcinoma breast cancer between 2006 and 2010. To ensure interpretability across all models, the Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) method was applied to RSF, DeepSurv, Random Forests (RF), and XGBoost. This enabled the identification of key predictors influencing breast cancer survival, highlighting consistent factors across models while uncovering unique insights specific to each approach.Results The performance of survival-specific and ML models were evaluated using the Concordance index (C-index), Integrated Brier Score (IBS), mean accuracy, and mean AUC. The CPH model achieved a C-index of 0 . 71 +/- 0 . 015 and an IBS of 0 . 08 +/- 0 . 006, while RSF demonstrated slightly better discriminatory power with a C-index of 0 . 72 +/- 0 . 0117. DeepSurv performed comparably, with a C-index of 0 . 71 +/- 0 . 0095 and an IBS of 0 . 09 +/- 0 . 0008. Both Cox and RSF models achieved the lowest IBS (0 . 08), indicating accurate survival probability predictions over time. For ML models, RF achieved a mean AUC of 0 . 74 +/- 0 . 0021, and XGBoost with a mean AUC 0 . 69 +/- 0 . 0183, reflecting fair discriminatory ability but not accounting for censoring in survival data. SHAP analysis for the top-performing models highlighted the extent of lymph node involvement, Regional Node-Positive (number of affected lymph nodes), tumor grade (cell abnormality and growth rate), progesterone status, and age as key predictors of breast cancer survival outcomes.Conclusions While ML models like XGBoost and RF can effectively identify important predictors and patterns in breast cancer outcomes, survival-specific methods such as the Cox model, RSF, and DeepSurv provide essential capabilities for handling time-to-event data and censoring, making them more suitable for accurate survival predictions. The primary objective of including ML models in this analysis was to leverage their interpretability in identifying key variables alongside survival-specific models, rather than to directly compare their performance against survival models. By examining both ML and survival models, this research highlights the complementary strengths of each approach. This study contributes to the integration of artificial intelligence in healthcare, emphasizing the value of data-driven survival modeling techniques in supporting healthcare professionals with accurate, personalized, and actionable insights for high-risk patients. Together, these approaches enhance the precision of survival predictions, paving the way for more informed clinical decision-making and improved patient care.

AB  - Vascular age is traditionally measured using invasive methods or through 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). This paper utilizes a low-cost single-lead (lead-I) ECG internet of thing (IoT) module to predict the vascular age of an apparently healthy young person. In addition, we also study the impact of smoking on ECG traces of the light-but-habitual smokers. We begin by collecting (lead-I) ECG data from 42 apparently healthy subjects (smokers and non-smokers) aged 18 to 30 years, using our custom-built low-cost, portable, single-lead ECG IoT module, and anthropometric data, e.g., body mass index, smoking status, blood pressure, etc. Under our proposed method, we first pre-process our dataset by denoising the ECG traces, followed by baseline drift removal, followed by z-score normalization. Next, we create another dataset by dividing the ECG traces into overlapping segments of five-second duration. We then feed both segmented and unsegmented datasets to a number of machine learning models, a 1D convolutional neural network, and ResNet18 model, for vascular ageing prediction. We also do transfer learning whereby we pre-train our models on a public PPG dataset, and later, fine-tune and evaluate them on our unsegmented ECG dataset. The random forest model outperforms all other models by achieving a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.07 and coefficient of determination R2\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$R<^>2$$\end{document} of 0.99, MSE of 3.56 and R2\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$R<^>2$$\end{document} of 0.26, MSE of 0.99 and R2\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$R<^>2$$\end{document} of 0.87, for segmented ECG dataset, for unsegmented ECG dataset, and for transfer learning scenario, respectively.

AB  - Introduction Triage is a pivotal function within the operational framework of an emergency department, as it directly influences patient outcomes and hospital efficiency. However, traditional triage methods frequently depend on human judgment, which is susceptible to high subjectivity and low efficiency.Methods To address these issues, this paper presents a novel emergency department triage algorithm. The proposed EDT-MCFEF (Emergency Triage Algorithm Based on Multi-Channel Feature Extraction and Fusion) addresses numerous shortcomings of conventional triage methodologies. The model employs a hybrid masking approach and RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Approach) to facilitate feature enhancement and word vector processing of text. Moreover, the model employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a multi-headed attention (MHA) mechanism to extract text features from multiple channels, effectively capturing both local and global features. Furthermore, this paper introduces a multi-channel feature fusion method, which integrates local and global features and achieves comprehensive learning and optimization of feature information through dynamic weight adjustment.Results and discussion The objective of this model is to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of emergency department triage, thereby providing scientific and technological support to the emergency department. In this paper, two medical text datasets are employed for experimental validation: a self-built emergency department triage dataset and a medical literature abstract dataset. The emergency department triage dataset consists of 28,000 English-annotated samples from 11 clinical departments, while the medical literature abstract dataset is a publicly available dataset (https://huggingface.co/datasets/123rc/medical_text). The experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed model exhibits superior accuracy to seven benchmark models utilized in this study on both medical text datasets, indicating its efficacy in handling imbalanced datasets. This suggests enhanced generalization and robustness. In addition to its strong classification ability, the model exhibits favorable interpretability through its multi-channel design, and the hybrid masking strategy supports data minimization and privacy protection, aligning with ethical AI principles. This approach holds promise for integration into clinical decision support systems for improved triage accuracy. The models and the self-built dataset presented in this paper are available at https://github.com/Yiii-master/EDT-MCFEF.

AB  - Background: The amount of available textual health data such as scientific and biomedical literature is constantly growing and becoming more and more challenging for health professionals to properly summarize those data and practice evidence-based clinical decision making. Moreover, the exploration of unstructured health text data is challenging for professionals without computer science knowledge due to limited time, resources, and skills. Current tools to explore text data lack ease of use, require high computational efforts, and incorporate domain knowledge and focus on topics of interest with difficulty.
   Objective: We developed a methodology able to explore and target topics of interest via an interactive user interface for health professionals with limited computer science knowledge. We aim to reach near state-of-the-art performance while reducing memory consumption, increasing scalability, and minimizing user interaction effort to improve the clinical decision-making process. The performance was evaluated on diabetes-related abstracts from PubMed.
   Methods: The methodology consists of 4 parts: (1) a novel interpretable hierarchical clustering of documents where each node is defined by headwords (words that best represent the documents in the node), (2) an efficient classification system to target topics, (3) minimized user interaction effort through active learning, and (4) a visual user interface. We evaluated our approach on 50,911 diabetes-related abstracts providing a hierarchical Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) structure, a unique identifier for a topic. Hierarchical clustering performance was compared against the implementation in the machine learning library scikit-learn. On a subset of 2000 randomly chosen diabetes abstracts, our active learning strategy was compared against 3 other strategies: random selection of training instances, uncertainty sampling that chooses instances about which the model is most uncertain, and an expected gradient length strategy based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
   Results: For the hierarchical clustering performance, we achieved an F1 score of 0.73 compared to 0.76 achieved by scikit-learn. Concerning active learning performance, after 200 chosen training samples based on these strategies, the weighted F1 score of all MeSH codes resulted in a satisfying 0.62 F1 score using our approach, 0.61 using the uncertainty strategy, 0.63 using the CNN, and 0.45 using the random strategy. Moreover, our methodology showed a constant low memory use with increased number of documents.
   Conclusions: We proposed an easy-to-use tool for health professionals with limited computer science knowledge who combine their domain knowledge with topic exploration and target specific topics of interest while improving transparency. Furthermore, our approach is memory efficient and highly parallelizable, making it interesting for large Big Data sets. This approach can be used by health professionals to gain deep insights into biomedical literature to ultimately improve the evidence-based clinical decision making process.

AB  - The rising prevalence of mouth and oral diseases (MOD), including gum disease and oral cancer, presents a significant global health challenge. Early detection is crucial for effective intervention. However, existing models often rely on complex preprocessing, computationally expensive operations, and specialized resources, leading to inefficiency and limited practicality. This paper presents a novel lightweight hybrid model that combines the local feature extraction strengths of CNNs with the global contextual power of Transformer attention mechanisms, contributing to the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical image analysis. The proposed architecture integrates the local feature extraction efficiency of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with the global context modeling strength of Transformers. This combination enables the model to effectively capture both fine-grained details and broader spatial patterns, while maintaining low computational complexity. By leveraging CNNs' weight-sharing properties for efficient feature extraction and Transformers' ability to model global patterns, the proposed model performs well across datasets of varying sizes and complexities. Its lightweight design emphasizes efficiency, with fewer parameters, reduced floating-point operations (FLOPs), and shorter inference times, making it ideal for real-time AI applications, particularly in resource-constrained environments. The proposed model is also well-suited for deployment on mobile devices and in regions with limited medical infrastructure, providing a scalable solution for early diagnosis in diverse healthcare settings. In the context of medical engineering, the proposed model is applied to the automated detection of mouth and oral diseases (MOD) using both clinical and histopathological images. This approach aims to enhance diagnostic capabilities in resource-constrained clinical environments. The model is rigorously evaluated on three datasets: the MOD dataset (5143 images, 7 classes), the Oral Cancer dataset (241 images, 2 classes), and the Histopathological Oral Cancer dataset (5192 images, 2 classes). The proposed model achieves accuracies of 99.03 %, 97.83 %, and 94.23 %, respectively-surpassing several state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Its strong performance, lightweight design, and enhanced interpretability position it as a practical and scalable solution for early and reliable oral disease detection in diverse clinical settings.

AB  - Chest X-ray (CXR) is a challenging problem in automated medical diagnosis, where complex visual patterns of thoracic diseases must be precisely identified through multi-label classification and lesion localization. Current approaches typically consider classification and localization in isolation, resulting in a piecemeal system that does not exploit common representations and is often not clinically interpretable, as well as limited in handling multi-label diseases. Although multi-task learning frameworks, such as DeepChest and CLN, appear to meet this goal, they suffer from task interference and poor explainability, which limits their practical application in real-world clinical workflows. To address these limitations, we present a unified multi-task deep learning framework, CXR-MultiTaskNet, for simultaneously classifying thoracic diseases and localizing lesions in chest X-rays. Our framework comprises a standard ResNet50 feature extractor, two task-specific heads for multi-task learning, and a Grad-CAM-based explainability module that provides accurate predictions and enhances clinical explainability. We formulate a joint loss that weighs the relative importance of representation extraction, which is large due to class variations, and the final loss, which is larger in the detection loss that occurs in extreme class imbalances between days and the detectability of varying disease manifestation types. Recent advances made by deep learning methods in the identification of disease in chest X-ray images are promising; however, there are limitations in their performance for complete analysis due to the lack of interpretability, some inherent weaknesses of convolutional neural networks (CNN), and prior learning of classification at the image level before localization of the disease. In this paper, we propose a dual-attention-based hierarchical feature extraction approach, which addresses the challenges of deep learning in detecting diseases in chest X-ray images. Through the use of visual attention maps, the detection steps can be better tracked, and therefore, the entire process is made more interpretable than with a traditional CNN-embedding model. We also manage to obtain both disease-level and pixel-level predictions, which enable explainable and comprehensive analysis of each image and aid in localizing each detected abnormality area. The proposed approach was further optimized for X-ray images by computing the objective losses during training, which ultimately gives higher significance to smaller lesions. Experimental evaluations on a benchmark chest X-ray dataset demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach achieving a macro F1-score of 0.965 (0.968 micro F1-score) for disease classification and mean IoU of 0.851 (mAP@0.50) for localization of diseases Content: Model intepretability, Chest X-ray image disease detection, Detection region localization, Weakly supervised transfer learning Lesion localization -> 5 of 0.927 Compared to state-of-the-art single-task and multi-task baselines, these results are consistently better. The presented framework provides an integrated, method-based approach to chest X-ray analysis that is clinically useful, interpretable, and scalable for automation, allowing for efficient diagnostic pathways and enhanced clinical decision-making. This single framework can serve as a router for next-gen explainable AI in radiology.

AB  - Introduction: The risk prediction of the occurrence of a clinical event is often based on conventional statistical procedures, through the implementation of risk score models. Recently, approaches based on more complex machine learning (ML) methods have been developed. Despite the latter usually have a better predictive performance, they obtain little approval from the physicians, as they lack interpretability and, therefore, clinical confidence. One clinical issue where both types of models have received great attention is the mortality risk prediction after acute coronary syndromes (ACS).
   Objective: We intend to create a new risk assessment methodology that combines the best characteristics of both risk score and ML models. More specifically, we aim to develop a method that, besides having a good performance, offers a personalized model and outcome for each patient, presents high interpretability, and incorporates an estimation of the prediction reliability which is not usually available. By combining these features in the same approach we expect that it can boost the confidence of physicians to use such a tool in their daily activity.
   Methods: In order to achieve the mentioned goals, a three-step methodology was developed: several rules were created by dichotomizing risk factors; such rules were trained with a machine learning classifier to predict the acceptance degree of each rule (the probability that the rule is correct) for each patient; that information was combined and used to compute the risk of mortality and the reliability of such prediction. The methodology was applied to a dataset of 1111 patients admitted with any type of ACS (myocardial infarction and unstable angina) in two Portuguese hospitals, to assess the 30-days all-cause mortality risk, being validated through a Monte-Carlo cross-validation technique. The performance was compared with state-of-the-art approaches: logistic regression (LR), artificial neural network (ANN), and clinical risk score model (namely the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events - GRACE).
   Results: For the scenario being analyzed, the performance of the proposed approach and the comparison models was assessed through discrimination and calibration. The ability to rank the patients was evaluated through the area under the ROC curve (AUC), and the ability to stratify the patients into low or high-risk groups was determined using the geometric mean (GM) of specificity and sensitivity, the negative predictive value (NPV) and the positive predictive value (PPV). The validation calibration curves were also inspected. The proposed approach (AUC = 81%, GM = 74%, PPV = 17%, NPV = 99%) achieved testing results identical to the standard LR model (AUC = 83%, GM = 73%, PPV = 16%, NPV=99%), but offers superior interpretability and personalization; it also significantly outperforms the GRACE risk model (AUC = 79%, GM = 47%, PPV = 13%, NPV = 98%) and the standard ANN model (AUC = 78%, GM = 70%, PPV = 13%, NPV = 98%). The calibration curve also suggests a very good generalization ability of the obtained model as it approaches the ideal curve (slope = 0.96). Finally, the reliability estimation of individual predictions presented a great correlation with the misclassifications rate.
   Conclusion: We developed and described a new tool that showed great potential to guide the clinical staff in the risk assessment and decision-making process, and to obtain their wide acceptance due to its interpretability and reliability estimation properties. The methodology presented a good performance when applied to ACS events, but those properties may have a beneficial application in other clinical scenarios as well.

AB  - BackgroundAI modeling CDM can improve the quality and efficiency of clinical practice or provide secondary opinion consultations for patients with limited medical resources to address healthcare disparities.PurposeIn this study, we developed an interpretable AI model to select radiotherapy treatment options, that is, whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) versus stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), for patients with brain metastases.Materials/MethodsA total of 232 patients with brain metastases treated by radiation therapy from 2018 to 2023 were obtained. CT/MR images with contoured target lesions and organs-at-risk (OARs) as well as non-image-based clinical parameters were extracted and digitized as inputs to the model. These parameters included (1) tumor size, shape, location, and proximity of lesions to OARs; (2) age; (3) the number of brain metastases; (4) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status; (5) presence of neurologic symptoms; (6) if surgery was performed (either pre/post-op RT); (7) newly diagnosed cancer with brain metastases (de-novo) versus re-treatment (either local or distant in the brain); (8) primary cancer histology; (9) presence of extracranial metastases; (10) extent of extracranial disease (progression vs. stable); and (11) receipt of systemic therapy. One vanilla and two interpretable 3D convolutional neural networks (CNN) models were developed. The vanilla one-path model (VM-1) uses only images as input, while the two interpretable models use both images and clinical parameters as inputs with two (IM-2) and 11 (IM-11) independent paths, respectively. This novel design allowed the model to calculate a class activation score for each input to interpret its relative weighting and importance in decision-making. The actual radiotherapy treatment (WBRT or SRS) used for the patients was used as ground truth for model training. The model performance was assessed by Stratified-10-fold cross-validation, with each fold consisting of selected 184 training, 24 validation, and 24 testing subjects.ResultA total of 232 brain metastases patients treated by WBRT or SRS were evaluated, including 80 WBRT and 152 SRS patients. Based on the images alone, the VM-1 model prescribed correctly for 143 (94%) SRS and 67 (84%) WBRT cases. Based on both images and clinical parameters, the IM-2 model prescribed correctly for 149 (98%) SRS and 74 (93%) WBRT cases. IM-11 provided the most interpretability with a relative weighting for each input as follows: CT image (59.5%), ECOG performance status (7.5%), re-treatment (5%), extracranial metastases (1.5%), number of brain metastases (9.5%), neurologic symptoms (3%), pre/post-surgery (2%), primary cancer histology (2%), age (1%), progressive extracranial disease (6%), and receipt of systemic therapy (4.5%), reflecting the importance of all these inputs in clinical decision-making.ConclusionInterpretable CNN models were successfully developed to use CT/MR images and non-image-based clinical parameters to predict the treatment selection between WBRT and SRS for brain metastases patients. The interpretability makes the model more transparent, carrying profound importance for the prospective integration of these models into routine clinical practice, particularly for informing real-time clinical decision-making.

AB  - Background Out of the pressure of Digital Transformation, the major industrial domains are using advanced and efficient digital technologies to implement processes that are applied on a daily basis. Unfortunately, this still does not happen in the same way in the medical domain. For this reason, doctors usually do not have the time or knowledge to evaluate all alternative treatment options for each patient accurately and individually. However, physicians can reduce their workload by using recommender systems, still having every decision under control. In this way, they also get an insight into how other physicians make treatment decisions in each situation. In this work, we report the development of a novel recommender system that uses predicted outcomes based on continuous-valued logic and multi-criteria decision operators. The advantage of this methodology is that it is transparent, since the model outcomes emulate logical decision processes based on the hierarchy of relevant physiological parameters, and second, it is safer against adversarial attacks than conventional deep learning methods since it drastically reduces the number of trainable parameters. Methods We test our methodology in a patient population with diabetes and heart insufficiency that becomes a therapy (beta-blockers, ACE or Aspirin). The original database (Pakistan database) is publicly available and accessible via the internet. However, to explore methods to protect the patient's identity and guarantee data privacy we implemented a methodology on a variable-by-variable basis by fitting a sequence of regression models and drawing synthetic values from the corresponding predictive distributions using linear regressions and norm rank. Furthermore, we implemented a deep-learning model based on logical gates modeled by perceptrons with fixed weights and biases. While a first trainable layer automatically recognizes a meaningful parameter hierarchy, the implemented Logic-Operator Neuronal Network (LONN) simulates cognitive processes like a rational, logical thinking process, considering that this logic is joined by fuzziness, i.e., logical operations are not exact but essentially fuzzy due to the implemented continuous-valued operators. The predicted outcomes of the model (kind of therapy-ACE, Aspirin or beta-blocker- and expected therapy time of the patient) are then implemented in a recommender system that compares two different models: model 1 trained on a population excluding negative outcomes (patient group 1, with no patient dead and long therapy times) and a model 2 trained on the whole patient population (patient group 2). In this way, we provide a recommendation of the best possible therapy based on the outcome of the model and the confidence of this recommendation when the outcome of model 1 is compared with the outcome of model 2. Results With the applied method for data synthetization, we obtained an error of about 1% for all the relevant parameters. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the LONN models reach an accuracy of about 75%. After comparing the LONN models against conventional deep-learning models we observe that our implemented models are less accurate (accuracy loss of about 8%). However, the loss of accuracy is compensated by the fact that LONN models are transparent and safe because the freezing of training parameters makes them less prone to adversarial attacks. Finally, we predict the best therapy as well as the expected therapy time.
   We were able to predict individualized therapies, which were classified as optimal (binary value) when the prediction fully matched predictions made with models 1 and 2. The results provided by the recommender system are displayed using a graphical interface. The current is a proof of concept to improve the quality of the disease management, while the methods are continuously visualized to preserve transparency for the customers. Conclusions This work contributes to simplify administrative functions and boost the quality of management of patients improving the quality of healthcare with models that are both transparent and safe. Our methodology can be extended to different clinical scenarios where recommender systems can be applied. The acceptance and further development of the app is one of the next important steps and still requires further development depending on specific requirements of the health management, the physicians or health professionals, and the patent population.

AB  - Deep learning has revolutionized medical image processing, offering powerful tools for diagnosing critical conditions like brain tumors, skin cancer, and pneumonia. However, the opaque nature of these models necessitates interpretability, especially in healthcare applications where transparency and trust are vital. This study addresses this challenge by integrating explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, specifically local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) and gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM), to enhance model transparency. A comparative analysis of five deep learning models-CNN, XceptionNet, EfficientNet, VGG, and ResNet-is conducted across three distinct medical image classification tasks. Performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, specificity, and AUC score, while LIME and Grad-CAM provide visual insights into the regions influencing model predictions, supporting clinical validation. The findings underscore the importance of XAI in improving model transparency, offering valuable insights into the reliability and applicability of deep learning models in medical image analysis, ultimately aiding in the development of more explainable and trustworthy AI systems for healthcare.

AB  - Background: The increasing use of Deep Learning (DL) in healthcare has highlighted the critical need for improved transparency and interpretability. While Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods provide insights into model predictions, reliability cannot be guaranteed by simply relying on explanations. Objectives: This position paper proposes the integration of Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) with XAI methods to improve model reliability and trustworthiness in healthcare applications. Methods: We examine state-of-the-art XAI and UQ techniques, discuss implementation challenges, and suggest solutions to combine UQ with XAI methods. We propose a framework for estimating both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in the XAI context, providing illustrative examples of their potential application. Results: Our analysis indicates that integrating UQ with XAI could significantly enhance the reliability of DL models in practice. This approach has the potential to reduce interpretation biases and over-reliance, leading to more cautious and conscious use of AI in healthcare.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) networks continue to grow and have been integrated into critical applications such as healthcare, industrial control, and national infrastructure. The interconnected nature and resource-constrained devices can create numerous entry points for malicious actors who can bring about data breaches, unauthorised access, service disruptions, and even compromise critical infrastructure. Ensuring the security of these networks is essential to maintain the integrity and availability of services that could have serious social, economic, or operational consequences. Automated Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) have been widely used to identify threats with high accuracy and reduced detection time. However, the complexity of machine learning and deep learning models poses a serious challenge to the transparency and interpretability of the produced detection results. The lack of explainability in AI-driven IDS undermines user confidence and limits their practical deployment, especially among non-expert stakeholders. To address these challenges, this paper investigates the use of Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to enhance the interpretability of AI-based IDSs within IoT ecosystems. Specifically, it applies SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) to different Machine learning models. The models' performance is evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. The results show that incorporating XAI techniques significantly improves the transparency of IDS results, allowing users to understand and trust the reasoning behind AI decisions. This enhanced interpretability not only supports more informed cybersecurity practices but also makes AI systems more accessible to non-specialist users.

AB  - The intelligent use of artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis is a significant step towards the rapidly advancing field of consumer electronics (CE) used in healthcare. It greatly improves the accuracy and usefulness of diagnostic processes. This paper introduces a novel MRI analysis approach through the lens of AIGC, leveraging physics-informed deep learning (PIDL) models. This integration pioneers a new paradigm in consumer healthcare diagnostics and embeds physics principles into deep learning (DL) models, thus improving interpretability and adherence to physical constraints. Additionally, this method improves the visibility of the healthcare community by integrating explainable AI (XAI) techniques, including gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME). This approach demonstrates a reasonable precision rate of 96% when applied to brain tumor MRI images. Therefore, this research introduces a new para diagram of applying AIGC in medical imaging analysis within Consumer Healthcare Electronics (CHE).

AB  - Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has shown benefits in clinical decision support systems (CDSSs); however, it is still unclear to CDSS developers how to select an XAI method to optimize the advice-taking of healthcare practitioners. We performed a user study on healthcare practitioners based on a machine learning-based CDSS for the prediction of gestational diabetes mellitus to explore and compare two XAI methods: explanation by feature contribution and explanation by example. Participants were asked to make estimates for both correctly and incorrectly predicted cases to determine if there were any over-reliance or self-reliance issues. We examined the weight of advice and healthcare practitioners' preferences. Our results based on statistical tests showed no significant difference between the two XAI methods regarding the advice-taking. The CDSS explained by either method had a substantial impact on the decision-making of healthcare practitioners; however, both methods may lead to over-reliance issues. We identified the inclination towards CDSS use as a key factor in the advice-taking from an explainable CDSS among obstetricians. Additionally, we found that different types of healthcare practitioners had differing preferences for explanations; therefore, we suggest that CDSS developers should select XAI methods according to their target users.

AB  - In this era, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is being employed in many health-related problems, but it faces challenges because most models produce results that are opaque and interpretable. The goal of explainable AI is to make machine learning, and deep learning models more understandable and accessible to people. Consequently, there is a pressing need for XAI models to enhance trust, given its increasing popularity in the field of medical artificial intelligence. This study explores the XAI nature of machine learning for disease prediction, with a particular focus on transparency and reliability of the results. The study examines the interpretability of artificial intelligence, focusing on issues such as bias, equality, and system reliability. The main theme is to minimize errors, disparities in human understanding, and use artificial intelligence in disease prediction to improve the outcomes for medical patients. The XAI methods were validated on Sclerosis predictions using two important models with fine-tuning their hyperparameters. The experiments demonstrated that the XAI methods outperformed the existing methods, achieving impressive results in terms of accuracy, recall, f1 score, precision, and AUC. The proposed approach achieved 98.53% accuracy using 75%-25% hold-out splitting, and 98.14% accuracy using 10-fold validation. This semantic approach is superior to previous methods by showing the abundance of correct predictions and demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting multiple sclerosis in the real world.

AB  - Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) in general and Natural Language Processing (NLP) in particular are paving the new way forward for the automated detection and prediction of mental health disorders among the population. Recent research in this area has prioritized predictive accuracy over model interpretability by relying on deep learning methods. However, prioritizing predictive accuracy over model interpretability can result in a lack of transparency in the decision-making process, which is critical in sensitive applications such as healthcare. There is thus a growing need for explainable AI (XAI) approaches to psychiatric diagnosis and prediction. The main aim of this work is to address a gap by conducting a systematic investigation of XAI approaches in the realm of automatic detection of mental disorders from language behavior leveraging textual data from social media. In pursuit of this aim, we perform extensive experiments to evaluate the balance between accuracy and interpretability across predictive mental health models. More specifically, we build BiLSTM models trained on a comprehensive set of human-interpretable features, encompassing syntactic complexity, lexical sophistication, readability, cohesion, stylistics, as well as topics and sentiment/emotions derived from lexicon-based dictionaries to capture multiple dimensions of language production. We conduct extensive feature ablation experiments to determine the most informative feature groups associated with specific mental health conditions. We juxtapose the performance of these models against a "black-box" domain-specific pretrained transformer adapted for mental health applications. To enhance the interpretability of the transformers models, we utilize a multi-task fusion learning framework infusing information from two relevant domains (emotion and personality traits). Moreover, we employ two distinct explanation techniques: the local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) method and a model-specific self-explaining method (AGRAD). These methods allow us to discern the specific categories of words that the information-infused models rely on when generating predictions. Our proposed approaches are evaluated on two public English benchmark datasets, subsuming five mental health conditions (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression and psychological stress).

AB  - Rapid technological advancements in healthcare have significantly enhanced diagnostics and patient care. The exponential growth of complex medical data requires innovative architectures to ensure efficient processing and real-world deployment. To address this need, quantum computing is revolutionizing healthcare applications by efficiently processing high-dimensional data. At the same time, artificial intelligence (AI) enhances disease detection and treatment planning; however, its black-box nature reduces trust. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) bridges this gap by improving interpretability and accountability in healthcare applications. This study explores the fusion of quantum computing with XAI (QXAI) to support improved medical decision-making. It presents a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art quantum-based, XAI-based, and QXAI-based techniques for healthcare solutions using a survey research questions-based methodology. We critically evaluate the capability of QXAI models to analyze vast and high-dimensional healthcare data using case studies. This work also highlights major challenges in the adoption of QXAI, such as privacy, ethical concerns, and standardization. Through a comprehensive analysis of recent developments, this review outlines key research directions to make QXAI more interpretable, reliable, and ethically compliant in real-world medical applications. Thus, this review provides valuable insights for researchers and offers practical guidelines for implementing quantum-enabled XAI models in real-world healthcare environments.

AB  - The success of artificial intelligence (AI), and deep learning models in particular, has led to their widespread adoption across various industries due to their ability to process huge amounts of data and learn complex patterns. However, due to their lack of explainability, there are significant concerns regarding their use in critical sectors, such as finance and healthcare, where decision-making transparency is of paramount importance. In this paper, we provide a comparative survey of methods that aim to improve the explainability of deep learning models within the context of finance. We categorize the collection of explainable AI methods according to their corresponding characteristics, and we review the concerns and challenges of adopting explainable AI methods, together with future directions we deemed appropriate and important.

AB  - The early prediction of ocular disease is certainly an obligatory concern in the domain of ophthalmic medicine. Although modern scientific discoveries have shown the potential to treat eye diseases by using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, explainable AI remains a crucial challenge confronting this area of research. Although some traditional methods put in significant effort, they cannot accurately predict the proper ocular diseases. However, incorporating AI into diagnosing eye diseases in healthcare complicates the situation as the decision-making process of AI demonstrates complexity, which is a significant concern, especially in major sectors like ocular disease prediction. The lack of transparency in the AI models may hinder the confidence and trust of the doctors and the patients, as well as their perception of the AI and its abilities. Accordingly, explainable AI is significant in ensuring trust in the technology, enhancing clinical decision-making ability, and deploying ocular disease detection. This research proposed an efficient transfer learning model for eye disease prediction to transform smart vision potential in the healthcare sector and meet conventional approaches' challenges while integrating explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). The integration of XAI in the proposed model ensures the transparency of the decision-making process through the comprehensive provision of rationale. This proposed model provides promising results with 95.74% accuracy and explains the transformative potential of XAI in advancing ocular healthcare. This significant milestone underscores the effectiveness of the proposed model in accurately determining various types of ocular disease. It is clearly shown that the proposed model is performing better than the previously published methods.

AB  - Stroke is among the leading causes of death, especially among old adults. Thus, the mortality rate and severe cerebral disability can be avoided when stroke is diagnosed at its early stages, followed by subsequent treatment. There is no doubt that healthcare specialists can find the necessary solutions more effectively and instantly with the help of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). In this study, we used ML classifiers and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to predict stroke. Six different ML classifiers that trained on available datasets for stroke patients. Six feature selection methodologies were used to extract essential features from the dataset. The XAI methods applied (Shapley Additive Values (SHAP), ELI5, and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME)). This study provides preliminary insights that may support the development of future tools to assist medical practitioners in managing patients, pending further clinical validation and real-world testing.

AB  - The increasing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in critical domains such as healthcare, law, and defense demands robust mechanisms to ensure transparency and explainability in decision-making processes. While machine learning and deep learning algorithms have advanced significantly, their growing complexity presents persistent interpretability challenges. Existing maturity frameworks, such as Capability Maturity Model Integration, fall short in addressing the distinct requirements of explainability in AI systems, particularly where ethical compliance and public trust are paramount. To address this gap, we propose the Maturity Model for eXplainable Artificial Intelligence: Analysis and Evaluation (MM4XAI-AE), a domain-agnostic maturity model tailored to assess and guide the practical deployment of explainability in AI-based applications. The model integrates two complementary components: an analysis model and an evaluation model, structured across four maturity levels-operational, justified, formalized, and managed. It evaluates explainability across three critical dimensions: technical foundations, structured design, and human-centered explainability. MM4XAI-AE is grounded in the PAG-XAI framework, emphasizing the interrelated dimensions of practicality, auditability, and governance, thereby aligning with current reflections on responsible and trustworthy AI. The MM4XAI-AE model is empirically validated through a structured evaluation of thirteen published AI applications from diverse sectors, analyzing their design and deployment practices. The results show a wide distribution across maturity levels, underscoring the model's capacity to identify strengths, gaps, and actionable pathways for improving explainability. This work offers a structured and scalable framework to standardize explainability practices and supports researchers, developers, and policymakers in fostering more transparent, ethical, and trustworthy AI systems.

AB  - Much of the research on eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has centered on providing transparency of machine learning models. More recently, the focus on human-centered approaches to XAI has increased. Yet, there is a lack of practical methods and examples on the integration of human factors into the development processes of AI-generated explanations that humans prove to uptake for better performance. This paper presents a case study of an application of a human-centered design approach for AI-generated explanations. The approach consists of three components: Domain analysis to define the concept & context of explanations, Requirements elicitation & assessment to derive the use cases & explanation requirements, and the consequential Multi-modal interaction design & evaluation to create a library of design patterns for explanations. In a case study, we adopt the DoReMi-approach to design explanations for a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) for child health. In the requirements elicitation & assessment, a user study with experienced paediatricians uncovered what explanations the CDSS should provide. In the interaction design & evaluation, a second user study tested the consequential interaction design patterns. This case study provided a first set of user requirements and design patterns for an explainable decision support system in medical diagnosis, showing how to involve expert end users in the development process and how to develop, more or less, generic solutions for general design problems in XAI.

KW  - Artificial intelligence
AB  - Background: The addition of ultrasonic plaque texture features to clinical features in patients with asymptomatic internal carotid artery stenosis (ACS) improved the ability of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to identify plaques that are likely to produce stroke. However, SVM like manyArtificial Intelligence (AI) black-box models lack transparency, limiting their adoption in critical settings. Explainable AI (XAI) techniques offer potential solutions by making model decision more interpretable. This study investigates whether incorporating XAI techniques can improve interpretability without significantly compromising predictive accuracy in stroke risk assessment. Methods: We developed an Argumentation-based Explainable Machine Learning (ArgEML) methodology and framework for explainable machine learning predictions via argumentation. We used this framework to learn explainable argumentation theories from a real-life dataset of patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis. We assessed the performance of these theories using standard machine learning (ML) metrics, while interpretability was evaluated through model transparency and quality of explanations. Results: Results indicate that the ArgEML models maintain high predictive accuracy while significantly improving the interpretability of the predictions. Moreover, undecided predictions are addressed as dilemmas which still offer valuable information through the explanations of the different prediction capabilities. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that ArgEML enhances the interpretability of stroke prediction from real life medical data without sacrificing predictive performance. Moreover, explanations offer valuable insights into misclassified cases and cases where a definite prediction cannot be derived. This transparency can help refine a model, guiding clinical decisions and improving AI adoption in healthcare.

AB  - Affective computing often relies on audiovisual data to identify affective states from non-verbal signals, such as facial expressions and vocal cues. Since automatic affect recognition can be used in sensitive applications, such as healthcare and education, it is crucial to understand how models arrive at their decisions. Interpretability of machine learning models is the goal of the emerging research area of Explainable AI (explainable AI (XAI)). This scoping review aims to survey the field of audiovisual affective machine learning to identify how XAI is applied in this domain. We first provide an overview of XAI concepts relevant to affective computing. Next, following the recommended PRISMA guidelines, we perform a literature search in the ACM, IEEE, Web of Science and PubMed databases. After systematically reviewing 1190 articles, a final set of 65 papers is included in our analysis. We quantitatively summarize the scope, methods and evaluation of the XAI techniques used in the identified papers. Our findings show encouraging developments for using XAI to explain models in audiovisual affective computing, yet only a limited set of methods are used in the reviewed works. Following a critical discussion, we provide recommendations for incorporating interpretability in future work for affective machine learning.

AB  - Explainable artificial intelligence is beneficial in converting opaque machine learning models into transparent ones and outlining how each one makes decisions in the healthcare industry. To comprehend the variables that affect decision-making regarding diabetes prediction that can be accounted for by model-agnostic techniques. In this project, we investigate how to generate local and global explanations for a machine-learning model built on a logistic regression architecture. We trained on 253,680 survey responses from diabetes patients using the explainable AI techniques LIME and SHAP. LIME and SHAP were then used to explain the predictions produced by the logistic regression and Random forest-based model on the validation and test sets. With a discussion of future work, the comparative analysis and discussion of various experimental findings between LIME and SHAP are provided, along with their strengths and weaknesses in terms of interpretation. With a high accuracy of 86% on the test set, we used LR architecture with a spatial attention mechanism, demonstrating the possibility of merging machine learning and explainable AI to improve diabetes prediction, diagnosis, and treatment. We also focus on various applications, difficulties, and probable future directions of machine learning models for LIME and SHAP interpreters.

AB  - Erythemato-squamous diseases (ESD) diagnosis is a significant challenge in dermatology. It is divided into six categories. Artificial intelligence models have been applied to categorize these categories. Artificial intelligent models are black boxes in nature. The objective of this study is to unbox the black-box behavior and interpret the decision-making. Random Forest and XGBoost models are applied on a standard dataset with SHAP value to get interpretability and causability of decision. The Random Forest model had a classification accuracy of 98.21%. Integration of explainability increase the transparency of result and identify the root cause of the disease in the subject. A comprehensive quantitative study will help to adopt artificial intelligence in healthcare with ethical issues like transparency, causability, and interpretability of diagnosis.

AB  - Machine learning has made rapid advances in safety-critical applications, such as traffic control, finance, and healthcare. With the criticality of decisions they support and the potential consequences of following their recommendations, it also became critical to provide users with explanations to interpret machine learning models in general, and black-box models in particular. However, despite the agreement on explainability as a necessity, there is little evidence on how recent advances in eXplainable Artificial Intelligence literature (XAI) can be applied in collaborative decision-making tasks, i.e., human decision-maker and an AI system working together, to contribute to the process of trust calibration effectively. This research conducts an empirical study to evaluate four XAI classes for their impact on trust calibration. We take clinical decision support systems as a case study and adopt a within-subject design followed by semi-structured interviews. We gave participants clinical scenarios and XAI interfaces as a basis for decision-making and rating tasks. Our study involved 41 medical practitioners who use clinical decision support systems frequently. We found that users perceive the contribution of explanations to trust calibration differently according to the XAI class and to whether XAI interface design fits their job constraints and scope. We revealed additional requirements on how explanations shall be instantiated and designed to help a better trust calibration. Finally, we build on our findings and present guidelines for designing XAI interfaces.

AB  - Brain tumor causes life-threatening consequences due to which its timely detection and accurate classification are critical for determining appropriate treatment plans while focusing on the improved patient outcomes. However, conventional approaches of brain tumor diagnosis, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computed Tomography (CT) scans, are often labor-intensive, prone to human error, and completely reliable on expertise of radiologists.Thus, the integration of advanced techniques such as Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) has brought revolution in the healthcare sector due to their supporting features or properties having ability to analyze medical images in recent years, demonstrating great potential for achieving accurate and improved outcomes but also resulted in a few drawbacks due to their black-box nature. As understanding reasoning behind their predictions is still a great challenge for the healthcare professionals and raised a great concern about their trustworthiness, interpretability and transparency in clinical settings. Thus, an advanced algorithm of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has been synergized with hybrid model comprising of DenseNet201 network for extracting the most important features based on the input Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data following supervised algorithm, support vector machine (SVM) to distinguish distinct types of brain scans. To overcome this, an explainable hybrid framework has been proposed that integrates DenseNet201 for deep feature extraction with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for robust binary classification. A region-adaptive preprocessing pipeline is used to enhance tumor visibility and feature clarity. To address the need for interpretability, multiple XAI techniques-Grad-CAM, Integrated Gradients (IG), and Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) have been incorporated. Our comparative evaluation shows that LRP achieves the highest performance across all explainability metrics, with 98.64% accuracy, 0.74 F1-score, and 0.78 IoU. The proposed model provides transparent and highly accurate diagnostic predictions, offering a reliable clinical decision support tool. It achieves 0.9801 accuracy, 0.9223 sensitivity, 0.9909 specificity, 0.9154 precision, and 0.9360 F1-score, demonstrating strong potential for real-world brain tumor diagnosis and personalized treatment strategies.

AB  - Ovarian cancer is a dangerous gynaecological malignancy, and the presence of many subtypes causes significant diagnostic difficulties. In general, the high accuracy of classification results in adequate prognosis and effectiveness of treatment. This work aims at the development of a Deep Learning (DL) approach for subtypes of ovarian cancer multiclassification, which tries to solve the problem of the creation of precise and reliable diagnostic methods. In the work, we have used and explored various DL models such as MobileNetV2, VGG19, ResNet18, ResNeXt, Xception, EfficientNet, and InceptionV3 to perform the classification task. Further, we used the state-of-the-art eXplainable Artificial Intelligence methods, including integrated gradient, saliency map, Grad-CAM, and DeepLift, to improve model interpretability. From our experiments, we inferred that the highest accuracy was achieved by InceptionV3, with a value of 97.96%. XAI techniques incorporated provide transparent insights into the model's operations during the decision-making process, thus increasing the level of trust and clinical usability. The proposed DL approach, by leveraging InceptionV3 as its top performer, has convincingly demonstrated the potential of AI to revolutionize the diagnosis of ovarian cancer through a high level of accuracy in subtype classification. XAI techniques integrated allow transparency support for the model and further enable its clinical adoption. All of these developments have significant potential for improved patient outcomes within the scope of personalized medicine in ovarian cancer treatment.

AB  - Neuro Degenerative Disorders (NDDs) involve progressive nerve cell loss, impacting functions like sensation, movement, memory, and cognition, posing life-threatening risks. Despite extensive research, viable therapies remain elusive due to complex pathophysiology. Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), shows promise in NDD diagnosis and treatment by leveraging vast datasets for accurate predictions. However, because AI models are "black boxes," explainable AI (XAI) had to be created to make sure that physicians and patients would trust and accept it. Early detection is critical to stop degeneration and make things better for patients. Many in-depth studies on XAI are designed explicitly for NDDs. Existing research does not constantly look at how to interpret NDDs, how to evaluate them, or how to keep them safe. This paper fills in these gaps by looking at and grouping XAI methods for different NDDs, to make them easier to understand and use in medical settings. In this paper, we look at the interpretability methods used in various NDD studies. The methods are split into five groups based on the conditions they are used to treat: Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). It organizes XAI methods into groups and talks about their pros, cons, and clinical importance. The study also finds some important research gaps. For example, it says that there are no good security frameworks and that XAI is hard to use in real-life healthcare settings. By giving helpful information and a plan for future research, this paper shows how XAI could change how NDDs are found, treated, and predicted. AI technologies will be used more in healthcare, and this will help us learn more about these challenging conditions.

TI  - Solving the explainable AI conundrum by bridging clinicians' needs and developers' goals
T2  - NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE
LA  - English
KW  - INFORMATION
AB  - Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has emerged as a promising solution for addressing the implementation challenges of AI/ML in healthcare. However, little is known about how developers and clinicians interpret XAI and what conflicting goals and requirements they may have. This paper presents the findings of a longitudinal multi-method study involving 112 developers and clinicians co-designing an XAI solution for a clinical decision support system. Our study identifies three key differences between developer and clinician mental models of XAI, including opposing goals (model interpretability vs. clinical plausibility), different sources of truth (data vs. patient), and the role of exploring new vs. exploiting old knowledge. Based on our findings, we propose design solutions that can help address the XAI conundrum in healthcare, including the use of causal inference models, personalized explanations, and ambidexterity between exploration and exploitation mindsets. Our study highlights the importance of considering the perspectives of both developers and clinicians in the design of XAI systems and provides practical recommendations for improving the effectiveness and usability of XAI in healthcare.

AB  - The primary objective of this research is to create a reliable technique to determine whether a patient has glioma, a specific kind of brain tumour, by examining various diagnostic markers, using a variety of machine learning as well as deep learning approaches, and involving XAI (explainable artificial intelligence) methods. Through the integration of patient data, including medical records, genetic profiles, algorithms using machine learning have the ability to predict how each individual will react to different medical interventions. To guarantee regulatory compliance and inspire confidence in AI-driven healthcare solutions, XAI is incorporated. Machine learning methods employed in this study includes Random Forest, decision trees, logistic regression, KNN, Adaboost, SVM, Catboost, LGBM classifier, and Xgboost whereas the deep learning methods include ANN and CNN. Four alternative XAI strategies, including SHAP, Eli5, LIME, and QLattice algorithm, are employed to comprehend the predictions of the model. The Xgboost, a ML model achieved accuracy, precision, recall, f1 score, and AUC of 88%, 82%, 94%, 88%, and 92%, respectively. The best characteristics according to XAI techniques are IDH1, Age at diagnosis, PIK3CA, ATRX, PTEN, CIC, EGFR and TP53. By applying data analytic techniques, the objective is to provide healthcare professionals with practical tool that enhances their capacity for decision-making, enhances resource management, and ultimately raises the bar for patient care. Medical experts can customise treatments and improve patient outcomes by taking into account patient's particular characteristics. XAI provides justifications to foster faith amongst patients and medical professionals who must rely on AI-assisted diagnosis and treatment recommendations.

AB  - Background Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) is a common vestibular disorder significantly impacting older adults, characterized by brief episodes of vertigo triggered by head movements. Accurate and timely diagnosis of BPPV can be challenging due to its overlapping symptoms with other conditions. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising approach to enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. PurposeThe primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of various ML models in predicting BPPV. This common vestibular disorder significantly impacts older adults. This research sought to build models that could accurately predict BPPV using readily available clinical data and to assess the application of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to enhance transparency and trust in ML-driven diagnoses. Methods In this study, we trained and evaluated several ML models on a rich dataset from Froedtert Hospital involving 7,760 patients characterized by a diverse range of demographic and clinical features. This robust dataset enabled a detailed exploration of the factors influencing BPPV. By employing explainable AI techniques, we aimed to enhance the predictive accuracy of our models and provide clinicians with transparent and interpretable insights into diagnostic reasoning, bridging the gap between machine learning efficacy and clinical usability. Results Gradient Boosting emerged as the most effective model, exhibiting the highest accuracy (85.422%), F1 (0.851), and AUC (0.911). Statistical analysis revealed significant demographic disparities in BPPV occurrence. Specifically, the odds ratio (OR) for BPPV among "White or Caucasian" individuals was 2.433 (p < 0.001), indicating a higher prevalence compared to other races. Conversely, "Black or African American" individuals had an OR of 0.851 (p < 0.05), and "Asian" individuals had an OR of 0.791 (p = 0.26). The study also found an OR of 4.498 (p < 0.001) for "Not Hispanic or Latino" individuals, suggesting a significantly higher prevalence of BPPV in this group. The application of XAI facilitated a deeper understanding and trust in model decisions, particularly highlighting how model predictions align with clinical indicators. Conclusion The study confirms that machine learning, complemented by Explainable AI, can effectively predict BPPV with high accuracy and interpretability. Leveraging XAI enhances the usability and acceptance of ML predictions in clinical settings, enabling healthcare providers to integrate these insights into their diagnostic processes. Future work should focus on further integrating these models into clinical practice to facilitate early and accurate BPPV diagnosis.

AB  - In the recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been widely deployed in the healthcare industry. The new AI technology enables efficient and personalized healthcare systems for the public. In this paper, transfer learning with pretrained VGGFace model is applied to identify sick symptoms based on the facial features of a person. As the deep learning model's operation is unknown for making a decision, this paper investigates the use of Explainable AI (XAI) techniques for soliciting explanations for the predictions made by the model. Various XAI techniques including Integrated Gradient, Explainable region-based AI (XRAI) and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) are studied. XAI is crucial to increase the model's transparency and reliability for practical deployment. Experimental results demonstrate that the attribution method can give proper explanations for the decisions made by highlighting important attributes in the images. The facial features that account for positive and negative classes predictions are highlighted appropriately for effective visualization. XAI can help to increase accountability and trustworthiness of the healthcare system as it provides insights for understanding how a conclusion is derived from the AI model.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a leading global health challenge due to its high mortality rate and the complexity of early diagnosis, driven by risk factors such as hypertension, high cholesterol, and irregular pulse rates. Traditional diagnostic methods often struggle with the nuanced interplay of these risk factors, making early detection difficult. In this research, we propose a novel artificial intelligence-enabled (AI-enabled) framework for CVD risk prediction that integrates machine learning (ML) with eXplainable AI (XAI) to provide both high- accuracy predictions and transparent, interpretable insights. Compared to existing studies that typically focus on either optimizing ML performance or using X AI separately for local or global explanations, our approach uniquely combines both local and global interpretability using Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). This dual integration enhances the interpretability of the model and facilitates clinicians to comprehensively understand not just what the model predicts but also why those predictions are made by identifying the contribution of different risk factors, which is crucial for transparent and informed decision-making in healthcare. The framework uses ML techniques such as K-nearest neighbors (KNN), gradient boosting, random forest, and decision tree, trained on a cardiovascular dataset. Additionally, the integration of LIME and SHAP provides patient- specific insights alongside global trends, ensuring that clinicians receive comprehensive and actionable information. Our experimental results achieve 98% accuracy with the Random Forest model, with precision, recall, and F1-scores of 97%, 98%, and 98%, respectively. The innovative combination of SHAP and LIME sets a new benchmark in CVD prediction by integrating advanced ML accuracy with robust interpretability, fills a critical gap in existing approaches. This framework paves the way for more explainable and transparent decision-making in healthcare, ensuring that the model is not only accurate but also trustworthy and actionable for clinicians.

AB  - Machine learning-based systems have presented increasing learning performance, in a wide variety of tasks. However, the problem with some state-of-the-art models is their lack of transparency, trustworthiness, and explainability. To address this problem, eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) appeared. It is a research field that aims to make black-box models more understandable to humans. The research on this topic has increased in recent years, and many methods, such as LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) have been proposed. Machine learning-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are one of the many application domains of XAI. However, most of the works about model interpretation focus on other fields, like computer vision, natural language processing, biology, healthcare, etc. This poses a challenge for cybersecurity professionals tasked with analyzing IDS results, thereby impeding their capacity to make informed decisions. In an attempt to address this problem, we have selected two XAI methods, LIME, and SHAP. Using the methods, we have retrieved explanations for the results of a black-box model, part of an IDS solution that performs intrusion detection on IoT devices, increasing its interpretability. In order to validate the explanations, we carried out a perturbation analysis where we tried to obtain a different classification based on the features present in the explanations. With the explanations and the perturbation analysis we were able to draw conclusions about the negative impact of particular features on the model results when present in the input data, making it easier for cybersecurity experts when analyzing the model results and it serves as an aid to the continuous improvement the model. The perturbations also serve as a comparison of performance between LIME and SHAP. To evaluate the degree of interpretability increase, and the explanations provided by each XAI method of the model and directly compare the XAI methods, we have performed a survey analysis.

AB  - This study explores the application of machine learning (ML) to derive and analyze individual gait patterns (i.e., gait signatures) from ground reaction force data. This study leverages three datasets containing 2,092 individuals, including 1,283 cases with pathological gait, and addresses three key objectives: (1) Demonstrating the uniqueness of gait signatures in a large-scale dataset with heterogeneity introduced by patient data and various conditions. (2) Characterizing gait signatures using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to highlight specific features that contribute to their uniqueness. (3) Evaluating the reliability of gait signatures and their characterizations across different numbers of individuals and training samples per individual. The results show that ML can accurately differentiate unique gait patterns across healthy individuals and patients with pathological gait patterns, highlighting the importance of considering individual gait signatures in clinical gait analysis. The high reliability of a person's unique gait signature may provide the basis for more personalized treatment decisions and rehabilitation programs, with XAI methods providing valuable insights into the key features that characterize individual gait. These results indicate that even more refined and personalized approaches are possible, extending beyond the conventional categories of pathology, age, and sex. This study provides a foundation for exploring the practical impact of gait signatures on rehabilitation, clinical diagnosis, and personalized treatment strategies.

AB  - The worldwide health epidemic of anaemia which is a condition with low levels of red blood cells or haemoglobin requires accurate prediction models to act promptly and improve patient outcomes because it is widespread and has different causes. The effective management of anaemia is piled with obstructions, which may include the variability of diagnostic criteria, the resource limitations of healthcare, and the multifactorial nature of the disease including nutritional deficiencies, chronic disease, and genetic factors. Conventional anaemia prediction models, that predominantly rely on statistics and are trained on clinical risk scores, are frequently incapable of providing practical solutions and meaningful insights into anaemia diagnosis. There is a growing interest in focusing on Artificial Intelligence (AI) use for anaemia prediction, however, traditional AI models (black boxes) lack transparency, which causes doctors not to pick them up for practical usage. Actionable insights that are enabled by transparent AI models (white boxes) based on the explainable AI methodologies reveal the rationales of the prediction, clarify the features that are responsible for them, and help clinicians and healthcare providers. In this research work, a transparent anaemia prediction model (white box) empowered by explainable AI techniques is proposed to address the limitations of black boxes in terms of transparency. The proposed model utilizes machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Trees, K-Neighbors Classifier, and Gradient Boosting Classifier, enhanced with Explainable AI (XAI) techniques like SHAP and LIME. With the integration of explainable AI techniques like SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), the proposed model offers insights into the underlying factors influencing anaemia predictions. The proposed model, significantly, represents exceptional growth in the healthcare sector and helps in bridging the gap between predictive performance and clinical interpretability, thus improving patient care and disease management strategies. The model simulation results are showing promising results in terms of the accuracy (98.13%) and the miss-rate (1.87%) which are the superior performance compared to the previous published approaches.

AB  - Background and Objective: Scalable, flexible and highly interpretable tools for predicting mortality in residential aged care facilities for the purpose of informing and optimizing palliative care decisions, do not exist. This study is the first and most comprehensive work applying machine learning to address this need while seeking to offer a transformative approach to integrating AI into palliative care decision-making. The objective is to predict survival in elderly individuals six months post-admission to residential aged care facilities with patient-level interpretability for transparency and support for clinical decision-making for palliative care options. Methods: Data from 11,944 residents across 40 facilities, with a novel combination of 18 features was used to develop predictive models, comparing standard approaches like Cox Proportional Hazards, Ridge and Lasso Regression with machine learning algorithms, Gradient Boosting (GB) and Random Survival Forest. Model calibration was performed together with ROC and a suite of evaluation metrics to analyze results. Explainable AI (XAI) tools were used to demonstrate both the cohort-level and patient-level model interpretability to enable transparency in the clinical usage of the models. TRIPOD reporting guidelines were followed, with model parameters and code provided publicly. Results: GB was the top performer with a Dynamic AUROC of 0.746 and a Concordance Index of 0.716 for six-month survival prediction. Explainable AI tools provided insights into key features such as comorbidities, cognitive impairment, and nutritional status, revealing their impact on survival outcomes and interactions that inform clinical decision-making. The calibrated model showed near-optimal performance with adjustable clinically relevant thresholds. The integration of XAI tools proved effective in enhancing the transparency and trustworthiness of predictions, offering actionable insights that support informed and ethically responsible end-of-life (EoL) care decisions in aged care settings. Conclusion: This study successfully applied machine learning to create viable survival models for aged care residents, demonstrating their usability for clinical settings via a suite of interpretable tools. The findings support the introduction into clinical trials of machine learning with explainable AI tools in geriatric medicine for mortality prediction to enhance the quality of EoL care and informed discussions regarding palliative care.

AB  - In the field of precision healthcare, where accurate decision-making is paramount, this study underscores the indispensability of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) in the context of epilepsy management within the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). The methodology entails meticulous preprocessing, involving the application of a band-pass filter and epoch segmentation to optimize the quality of Electroencephalograph (EEG) data. The subsequent extraction of statistical features facilitates the differentiation between seizure and non-seizure patterns. The classification phase integrates Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Random Forest classifiers. Notably, SVM attains an accuracy of 97.26%, excelling in the precision, recall, specificity, and F1 score for identifying seizures and non-seizure instances. Conversely, KNN achieves an accuracy of 72.69%, accompanied by certain trade-offs. The Random Forest classifier stands out with a remarkable accuracy of 99.89%, coupled with an exceptional precision (99.73%), recall (100%), specificity (99.80%), and F1 score (99.86%), surpassing both SVM and KNN performances. XAI techniques, namely Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP), enhance the system's transparency. This combination of machine learning and XAI not only improves the reliability and accuracy of the seizure detection system but also enhances trust and interpretability. Healthcare professionals can leverage the identified important features and their dependencies to gain deeper insights into the decision-making process, aiding in informed diagnosis and treatment decisions for patients with epilepsy.

AB  - As Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly utilized in dermatology, ensuring fairness in the development of Machine Learning models is crucial, particularly in skin lesion classification, where decisions can significantly impact people's lives. This study investigates the presence of biases between different Fitzpatrick Skin Types in baseline pretrained models and evaluates various training techniques to mitigate these disparities. An unsupervised skin transformer is developed to adjust an image's Fitzpatrick Skin Type (FST), and joint regularization and synthetic image blending methods are employed to address bias concerns. Additionally, eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, such as Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), are utilized to identify any underlying reasons for bias in the models. The results indicate that joint regularization and synthetic blending methods enhance the area under the curve performance and fairness. Meanwhile, XAI was found to be a valuable tool for fine-tuning Deep Learning models and uncovering problems. These findings can aid in developing accurate and unbiased skin lesion classification models, promoting equitable healthcare, and improving patient outcomes.

AB  - BackgroundMalaria, an infectious disease caused by protozoan parasites belonging to the Plasmodium genus, remains a significant public health challenge, with African regions bearing the heaviest burden. Machine learning techniques have shown great promise in improving the diagnosis of infectious diseases, such as malaria.ObjectivesThis study aims to integrate ensemble machine learning models and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) frameworks to enhance the diagnosis accuracy of malaria.MethodsThe study utilized a dataset from the Federal Polytechnic Ilaro Medical Centre, Ilaro, Ogun State, Nigeria, which includes information from 337 patients aged between 3 and 77 years (180 females and 157 males) over a 4-week period. Ensemble methods, namely Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boost, XGBoost, and CatBoost, were employed after addressing class imbalance through oversampling techniques. Explainable AI techniques, such as LIME, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) and Permutation Feature Importance, were utilized to enhance transparency and interpretability.ResultsAmong the ensemble models, Random Forest demonstrated the highest performance with an ROC AUC score of 0.869, followed closely by CatBoost at 0.787. XGBoost, Gradient Boost, and AdaBoost achieved ROC AUC scores of 0.770, 0.747, and 0.633, respectively. These methods evaluated the influence of different characteristics on the probability of malaria diagnosis, revealing critical features that contribute to prediction outcomes.ConclusionBy integrating ensemble machine learning models with explainable AI frameworks, the study promoted transparency in decision-making processes, thereby empowering healthcare providers with actionable insights for improved treatment strategies and enhanced patient outcomes, particularly in malaria management.

AB  - Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) based on machine learning (ML) hold great promise for improving medical care. Technically, such CDSSs are already feasible but physicians have been skeptical about their application. In particular, their opacity is a major concern, as it may lead physicians to overlook erroneous outputs from ML-based CDSSs, potentially causing serious consequences for patients. Research on explainable AI (XAI) offers methods with the potential to increase the explainability of black-box ML systems. This could significantly accelerate the application of ML based CDSSs in medicine. However, XAI research to date has mainly been technically driven and largely neglects the needs of end users. To better engage the users of ML-based CDSSs, we applied a design science approach to develop a design for explainable ML-based CDSSs that incorporates insights from XAI literature while simultaneously addressing physicians' needs. This design comprises five design principles that designers of ML-based CDSSs can apply to implement user-centered explanations, which are instantiated in a prototype of an explainable ML-based CDSS for lung nodule classification. We rooted the design principles and the derived prototype in a body of justificatory knowledge consisting of XAI literature, the concept of usability, and an online survey study involving 57 physicians. We refined the design principles and their instantiation by conducting walk-throughs with six radiologists. A final experiment with 45 radiologists demonstrated that our design resulted in physicians perceiving the ML-based CDSS as more explainable and usable in terms of the required cognitive effort than a system without explanations.

AB  - Machine learning revolutionizes accuracy in diverse fields such as disease diagnosis, speech understanding, and sentiment analysis. However, its intricate architecture often obscures the decision-making process, creating a "black box" that hinders trust and limits its potential. This lack of transparency poses significant challenges, particularly in critical fields like the healthcare system. We present OntoXAI, a Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) based Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) approach to address these challenges. OntoXAI leverages semantic technology and machine learning (ML) to enhance prediction accuracy and generate user-comprehensible natural language explanations in the context of dengue disease classification. OntoXAI can be summarized into three key aspects. (1) Creates a knowledge base that incorporates domain-specific knowledge related to the disease. This allows for the integration of expert knowledge into the classification process. (2) OntoXAI presents a diagnostic classification system that utilizes patient symptoms as input to classify the disease accurately. By leveraging ML algorithms, it achieves high accuracy in disease classification. (3) OntoXAI introduces SWRL and ontology to integrate explainable AI techniques with Open AI API, enabling a better understanding of the classification process. By combining the power of machine learning algorithms with the ability to provide transparent, human-understandable explanations through Open AI API, this approach offers several advantages in enhancing prediction accuracy, achieving levels of up to 96%. Overall, OntoXAI represents a significant advancement in the field of explainable AI, addressing the challenges of transparency and trust in machine learning systems, particularly in critical domains like healthcare.

AB  - Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) pose a global health challenge due to their increasing incidence and delayed detection, compounded by the burden they place on healthcare systems worldwide. This surge is particularly pronounced in both industrialized and emerging nations, fueled by the rising prevalence of conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. While Artificial Intelligence (AI) shows promise for early CKD detection, issues with data security, model transparency, and decision-making trust have created uncertainty among both patients and healthcare providers. To tackle these issues, a decentralized collaborative learning framework utilizing explainable AI to detect CKD is proposed. This approach combines the privacy-preserving nature of blockchain technology with the interpretability of explainable AI models. A real-time environment was set up to conduct these experiments, simulating a network of healthcare providers collaborating on CKD detection while maintaining patient privacy.

AB  - This study presents a novel clinical decision support platform for orthodontic-orthognathic treatment that integrates multi-task reinforcement learning with explainable artificial intelligence. The platform addresses the challenges of personalized treatment planning in complex dentofacial deformities by formulating treatment as a sequential decision-making process optimizing multiple clinical objectives simultaneously. We developed a comprehensive framework comprising: (1) a multi-task reinforcement learning core with specialized state-action representations for craniofacial structures; (2) complementary explainable AI components that render complex model decisions interpretable within clinical contexts; and (3) an interactive interface facilitating collaborative human-AI decision-making. Experimental validation with 347 retrospectively analyzed cases demonstrated significant improvements in treatment plan quality (19.9%), decision efficiency (73.9% time reduction), and prediction accuracy (92.7%) compared to conventional methods. Clinical evaluation by multidisciplinary specialists confirmed the system's practical utility, with particularly strong performance in complex cases featuring multiple dentofacial abnormalities. The proposed platform represents a significant advancement toward evidence-driven, personalized treatment planning in orthodontic-orthognathic therapy while maintaining clinical interpretability and expert oversight.

AB  - Potential uses of automated Facial Expression Recognition (FER) cover a wide range of applications such as customer behavior analysis, healthcare applications or providing personalized services. Data for machine learning play a fundamental role, therefore, understanding the relevancy of the data in the outcomes is of utmost importance. In this work we present a study on how gender influences the learning of a FER system. We analyze with Explainable Artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques how gender contributes to the learning and assess which facial expressions are more similar regarding face regions that impact on the classification. Results show that there exist common regions in some expressions both for females and males with different intensities (e.g. happiness); however, there are other expressions like disgust, where important face regions differ. The insights of this work will help improving FER systems and understand the source of any inequality.

AB  - Regenerative AI is transforming breast cancer diagnosis and treatment through enhanced imaging analysis, personalized medicine, drug discovery, and remote patient monitoring. AI algorithms can detect subtle patterns in mammograms and other imaging modalities with high accuracy, potentially leading to earlier diagnoses. In treatment planning, AI integrates patient-specific data to predict individual responses and optimize therapies. For drug discovery, generative AI models rapidly design and screen novel molecules targeting breast cancer pathways. Remote monitoring tools powered by AI provide real-time insights to guide care. Examples include Google's LYNA for analyzing pathology slides, Kheiron's Mia for mammogram interpretation, and Tempus's platform for integrating clinical and genomic data. While promising, challenges remain, including limited high-quality training data, integration into clinical workflows, interpretability of AI decisions, and regulatory/ethical concerns. Strategies to address these include collaborative data-sharing initiatives, user-centered design, explainable AI techniques, and robust oversight frameworks. In developing countries, AI tools like MammoAssist and Niramai's thermal imaging system are improving access to screening. Overall, regenerative AI offers significant potential to enhance breast cancer care, but judicious implementation with awareness of limitations is crucial. Coordinated efforts across the healthcare ecosystem are needed to fully realize AI's benefits while addressing challenges.

AB  - Early and accurate detection of breast cancer is essential for reducing mortality rates and improving clinical outcomes. However, deep learning (DL) models used in healthcare face significant challenges, including concerns about data privacy, domain-specific overfitting, and limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose BreastSwinFedNetX, a federated learning (FL)-enabled ensemble system that combines four hierarchical variants of the Swin Transformer (Tiny, Small, Base, and Large) with a Random Forest (RF) meta-learner. By utilizing FL, our approach ensures collaborative model training across decentralized and institution-specific datasets while preserving data locality and preventing raw patient data exposure. The model exhibits strong generalization and performs exceptionally well across five benchmark datasets-BreakHis, BUSI, INbreast, CBIS-DDSM, and a Combined dataset-achieving an F1 score of 99.34% on BreakHis, a PR AUC of 98.89% on INbreast, and a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 99.61% on the Combined dataset. To enhance transparency and clinical adoption, we incorporate explainable AI (XAI) through Grad-CAM, which highlights class-discriminative features. Additionally, we deploy the model in a real-time web application that supports uncertainty-aware predictions and clinician interaction and ensures compliance with GDPR and HIPAA through secure federated deployment. Extensive ablation studies and paired statistical analyses further confirm the significance and robustness of each architectural component. By integrating transformer-based architectures, secure collaborative training, and explainable outputs, BreastSwinFedNetX provides a scalable and trustworthy AI solution for real-world breast cancer diagnostics.

Adopting artificial intelligence (AI) technology in the food supply chain is one strategy to reduce these hazards. Although the use of AI has been rising in numerous industries, such as precision nutrition, self-driving cars, precision agriculture, precision medicine and food safety, much of what AI systems do is a black box due to its poor explainability. This study covers numerous use cases of food fraud risk prediction using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, such as LIME, SHAP and WIT. We aimed to interpret the predictions of a machine learning model with the aid of these technologies. The case study was performed on a food fraud dataset using adulteration/fraud notifications retrieved from the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed system and economically motivated adulteration database. A deep learning model was built based on this dataset and XAI tools have been investigated on the proposed deep learning model. Both features and shortcomings of the current XAI tools in the food fraud area have been presented.

AB  - This paper describes the implementation of a comprehensive clinical decision support system (CDSS) for the risk factors prediction of comorbidities related to obesity and for the characterization of indirect connections between such comorbidities and non-communicable diseases. In particular, the direct correlation between obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular, and heart disease is analyzed by using machine learning (ML) predictive models, while the connection of the co-occurring disorders to the numerous additional non-communicable diseases is analyzed via a graph-based user interface. The CDSS here proposed is, therefore, structured with three main components: ML predictive models based on publicly available datasets, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) local and global model interpretation, and graph-based representation of non-communicable disease connections. Multiple ML models are presented for risk assessment and a comparison is carried out based on performance key performance indicators. The best-performing model for each disease was proved to be: the multi-layer perceptron for diabetes and heart disease, and extreme gradient boosting for cardiovascular disease. Comorbidities risk factor prediction and a XAI local model explanation is performed on significant case studies. In addition, XAI global model interpretation is given for the entire dataset providing insights on the features' contribution to the models' implementation. Moreover, the graph-based visualization of indirect disease co-occurrence is performed by filtering connections according to different relative risk factor thresholds. This interface can be exploited by healthcare professionals to obtain, according to the needs and the clinical approach, a global perspective on obesity and its associated pathologies prevention as well as long-term treatment and care provision.

AB  - In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has shown great promise in medicine. However, explainability issues make AI applications in clinical usages difficult. Some research has been conducted into explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to overcome the limitation of the black-box nature of AI methods. Compared with AI techniques such as deep learning, XAI can provide both decision-making and explanations of the model. In this review, we conducted a survey of the recent trends in medical diagnosis and surgical applications using XAI. We have searched articles published between 2019 and 2021 from PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Association for Computing Machinery, and Google Scholar. We included articles which met the selection criteria in the review and then extracted and analyzed relevant information from the studies. Additionally, we provide an experimental showcase on breast cancer diagnosis, and illustrate how XAI can be applied in medical XAI applications. Finally, we summarize the XAI methods utilized in the medical XAI applications, the challenges that the researchers have met, and discuss the future research directions. The survey result indicates that medical XAI is a promising research direction, and this study aims to serve as a reference to medical experts and AI scientists when designing medical XAI applications.

AB  - Women exhibit marked physiological transformations in pregnancy, mandating regular and holistic assessment. Maternal and fetal vitality is governed by a spectrum of clinical, demographic, and lifestyle factors throughout this critical period. The existing maternal health monitoring techniques lack precision in assessing pregnancy-related risks, often leading to late interventions and adverse outcomes. Accurate and timely risk prediction is crucial to avoid miscarriages. This research proposes a deep learning framework for personalized pregnancy risk prediction using the NFHS-5 dataset, and class imbalance is addressed through a hybrid NearMiss-SMOTE approach. Fifty-one primary features are selected via the LASSO to refine the dataset and enhance model interpretability and efficiency. The framework integrates a multimodal model (NFHS-5, fetal plane images, and EHG time series) along with two core architectures. ResRNN-Net further combines Bi-LSTM, CNNs, and attention mechanisms to capture sequential dependencies. MultiScaleFusion-Net leverages GRU and multiscale convolutions for effective feature extraction. Additionally, TabNet and MLP models are explored to compare interpretability and computational efficiency. SHAP and Grad-CAM are used to ensure transparency and explainability, offering both feature importance and visual explanations of predictions. The proposed models are trained using 5-fold stratified cross-validation and evaluated with metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. The results demonstrate that MultiScaleFusion-Net balances accuracy and computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-time clinical deployment, while ResRNN-Net achieves higher precision at a slight computational cost. Performance comparisons with baseline machine learning models confirm the superiority of deep learning approaches, achieving over 80% accuracy in pregnancy complication prediction.

AB  - This paper presents a cross-layer intrusion detection framework leveraging explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) and interpretability methods to enhance transparency and robustness in attack detection within the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) domain. By addressing the dual challenges of compromised data integrity, which span both biosensor and network-layer data, this study combines advanced techniques to enhance interpretability, accuracy, and trust. Unlike conventional flow-based intrusion detection systems that primarily rely on transport-layer statistics, the proposed framework operates directly on raw packet-level features and application-layer semantics, including MQTT message types, payload entropy, and topic structures. The key contributions of this research include the application of K-Means clustering combined with the principal component analysis (PCA) algorthim for initial categorization of attack types, the use of SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) for feature prioritization to identify the most influential factors in model predictions, and the employment of Partial Dependence Plots (PDP) and Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) to elucidate feature interactions across layers. These methods enhance the system's interpretability, making data-driven decisions more accessible to nontechnical stakeholders. Evaluation on a realistic healthcare IoMT testbed demonstrates significant improvements in detection accuracy and decision-making transparency. Furthermore, the proposed approach highlights the effectiveness of explainable and cross-layer intrusion detection for secure and trustworthy medical IoT environments that are tailored for cybersecurity analysts and healthcare stakeholders.

AB  - There have recently been rapid developments in smart healthcare systems, such as precision diagnosis, smart diet management, and drug discovery. These systems require the integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) for data acquisition, Digital Twins (DT) for data representation into a digital replica and Artificial Intelligence (AI) for decision-making. DT is a digital copy or replica of physical entities (e.g., patients), one of the emerging technologies that enable the advancement of smart healthcare systems. AI and Machine Learning (ML) offer great benefits to DT-based smart healthcare systems. They also pose certain risks, including security risks, and bring up issues of fairness, trustworthiness, explainability, and interpretability. One of the challenges that still make the full adaptation of AI/ML in healthcare questionable is the explainability of AI (XAI) and interpretability of ML (IML). Although the study of the explainability and interpretability of AI/ML is now a trend, there is a lack of research on the security of XAI-enabled DT for smart healthcare systems. Existing studies limit their focus to either the security of XAI or DT. This paper provides a brief overview of the research on the security of XAI-enabled DT for smart healthcare systems. It also explores potential adversarial attacks against XAI-enabled DT for smart healthcare systems. Additionally, it proposes a framework for designing XAI-enabled DT for smart healthcare systems that are secure and trusted.

AB  - Introduction Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are complex and affect a large part of the world's population; early accurate and timely prediction is also complicated. Typically, predicting CVDs involves using statistical models and other forms of standard machine learning. Although these methods offer some level of prediction, their black-box nature severely hinders the ability of the healthcare professional to trust and use the predictions. The following are some of the challenges that Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) may solve since it can give an understanding of the decision-making system of AI to build confidence and increase usability.Methods This research introduced an intelligent forecasting system for cardiovascular events using XAI and addressed the limitations of traditional methods. This proposed system incorporates advanced machine learning algorithms integrated with XAI to examine a dataset comprising 308,737 patient records with features including age, BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and lifestyle factors. This dataset was sourced from the Kaggle Cardiovascular Disease dataset.Results Incorporating XAI offers an understandable explanation so that the healthcare professional can understand and make the AI-driven prediction trustworthy enough to improve the decision-making of treatment and care delivery for the patients. The simulation results of the proposed system provide better results than those of the previously published research works in terms of 91.94% accuracy and 8.06% miss rate.Discussion This proposed system makes it clear that XAI has the potential to significantly improve cardiovascular healthcare by enhancing transparency, reliability, and the quality of patient care.

AB  - Machine learning (ML) has transformed various sectors, including healthcare, by enabling the extraction of complex knowledge and predictions from vast datasets. However, the opacity of ML models, often referred to as "black boxes," hinders their integration into medical practice. Explainable AI (XAI) has emerged as a crucial area for enhancing the transparency and understandability of ML model decisions, particularly in healthcare where reliability and accuracy are paramount. However, the reliability of the explanations provided by ML models remains a major challenge. This mainly concerns the difficulty of maintaining the validity and relevance of the new training and test data explanations. In this study, we propose a structured approach to enhance and evaluate the reliability of explanations provided by ML models in healthcare. We aim to improve the reliability of explainability by combining the XAI approaches with the k-fold technique. We then developed several metrics to assess the generalizability, concordance, and stability of the combined XAI and k-fold approach, which we applied to case studies on hypothyroidism and diabetes risk prediction using SHAP and LIME frameworks. Our findings reveal that the SHAP approach combined with k-fold exhibits superior generalizability, stability, and concordance compared to the combination of LIME with k-fold. SHAP and k-fold integration provide reliable explanations for hypothyroidism and diabetes predictions, providing strong concordance with the internal explainability of the random forest model, the best generalizability, and good stability. This structured approach can bolster practitioner's confidence in ML models and facilitate their adoption in healthcare settings.

AB  - Artificial intelligence and deep learning are powerful tools for extracting knowledge from large particularly in healthcare. However, their black-box nature raises interpretability concerns, especially stakes applications. Existing eXplainable Artificial Intelligence methods often focus solely on visualization rule-based explanations, limiting interpretability's depth and clarity. This work proposes a novel AI method specifically designed for medical image analysis, integrating statistical, visual, and explanations to improve transparency in deep learning models. Statistical features are derived features extracted using a custom Mobilenetv2 model. A two-step feature selection method-filtering with mutual importance selection-ranks and refines these features. Decision tree and RuleFit are employed to classify data and extract human-readable rules. Additionally, a novel statistical feature overlay visualization generates heatmap-like representations of three key statistical measures (mean, and entropy), providing both localized and quantifiable visual explanations of model decisions. The method has been validated on five medical imaging datasets-COVID-19 radiography, ultrasound breast brain tumor magnetic resonance imaging, lung and colon cancer histopathological, and glaucoma images results confirmed by medical experts, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing interpretability image classification tasks.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is rising as a significant concern for the healthcare sector around the world. Researchers have applied multiple traditional approaches to making healthcare systems find new solutions for the CVD concern. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and blockchain are emerging approaches that may be integrated into the healthcare sector to help responsible and secure decision-making in dealing with CVD concerns. Secure CVD information is needed while dealing with confidential patient healthcare data, especially with a decentralized blockchain technology (BCT) system that requires strong encryption. However, AI and blockchain-empowered approaches could make people trust the healthcare sector, mainly in diagnosing areas like cardiovascular care. This research proposed an explainable AI (XAI) approach entangled with BCT that enhances healthcare interpretability and responsibility to cardiovascular health medical experts. XAI is significant in addressing cardiovascular prediction issues and offers potential solutions for complex communication and decision-making in cardiovascular care. The proposed approach performs better, with the highest accuracy of 97.12% compared to earlier methods. This achievement shows its ability to tackle complex issues, accessible during healthcare sector communication and decision processes.

AB  - The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has transformed healthcare delivery but faces critical challenges, including cybersecurity threats that endanger patient safety and data integrity. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are essential for protecting IoMT networks, yet conventional models often struggle with class imbalance, lack interpretability, and are unsuitable for real-world deployment in sensitive healthcare settings. This study aims to develop an innovative, explainable IDS framework tailored for IoMT systems that ensures both high detection accuracy and model transparency. The proposed approach integrates a hybrid random sampling technique to mitigate class imbalance, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) for feature selection, and an optimized XGBoost classifier for robust attack detection. Explainable AI techniques, namely SHAP and LIME, are employed to provide global and local insights into model predictions, enhancing interpretability and trustworthiness. The system was evaluated using the WUSTL-EHMS-2020 dataset, which contains network flow and biometric data, achieving outstanding performance: 99.22% accuracy, 98.35% precision, 99.91% recall, 99.12% F1-score, and 100% ROC-AUC. The proposed framework outperforms several traditional Machine Learning (ML) models and state-of-the-art IDS approaches, demonstrating its robustness and suitability for practical healthcare environments. By integrating advanced ML with explainable AI, this work addresses the critical need for secure, interpretable, and high-performing IDS solutions in IoMT systems. The study concludes that explainability is not an optional feature but a fundamental requirement in healthcare cybersecurity, and the proposed framework represents a significant step towards safer and more accountable AI-driven security solutions for the IoMT ecosystem.

AB  - The need for AI systems to provide explanations for their behaviour is now widely recognised as key to their adoption. In this article, we examine the problem of trustworthy AI and explore what delivering this means in practice, with a focus on healthcare applications. Work in this area typically treats trustworthy AI as a problem of Human-Computer Interaction involving the individual user and an AI system. However, we argue here that this overlooks the important part played by organisational accountability in how people reason about and trust AI in socio-technical settings. To illustrate the importance of organisational accountability, we present findings from ethnographic studies of breast cancer screening and cancer treatment planning in multidisciplinary team meetings to show how participants made themselves accountable both to each other and to the organisations of which they are members. We use these findings to enrich existing understandings of the requirements for trustworthy AI and to outline some candidate solutions to the problems of making AI accountable both to individual users and organisationally. We conclude by outlining the implications of this for future work on the development of trustworthy AI, including ways in which our proposed solutions may be re-used in different application settings.

AB  - BackgroundUnderstanding the complex interplay between life course exposures, such as adverse childhood experiences and environmental factors, and disease risk is essential for developing effective public health interventions. Traditional epidemiological methods, such as regression models and risk scoring, are limited in their ability to capture the non-linear and temporally dynamic nature of these relationships. Deep learning (DL) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) are increasingly applied within healthcare settings to identify influential risk factors and enable personalised interventions. However, significant gaps remain in understanding their utility and limitations, especially for sparse longitudinal life course data and how the influential patterns identified using explainability are linked to underlying causal mechanisms.MethodsWe conducted a controlled simulation study to assess the performance of various state-of-the-art DL architectures including CNNs and (attention-based) RNNs against XGBoost and logistic regression. Input data was simulated to reflect a generic and generalisable scenario with different rules used to generate multiple realistic outcomes based upon epidemiological concepts. Multiple metrics were used to assess model performance in the presence of class imbalance and SHAP values were calculated.ResultsWe find that DL methods can accurately detect dynamic relationships that baseline linear models and tree-based methods cannot. However, there is no one model that consistently outperforms the others across all scenarios. We further identify the superior performance of DL models in handling sparse feature availability over time compared to traditional machine learning approaches. Additionally, we examine the interpretability provided by SHAP values, demonstrating that these explanations often misalign with causal relationships, despite excellent predictive and calibrative performance.ConclusionsThese insights provide a foundation for future research applying DL and XAI to life course data, highlighting the challenges associated with sparse healthcare data, and the critical need for advancing interpretability frameworks in personalised public health.

AB  - The opaque nature of algorithmic decision-making often leads to public distrust in AI-driven decisions, highlighting the need for explainable AI (XAI) in public services. While research has focused on AI model development, public preferences for XAI remain underexplored. This study investigates public acceptance of XAI in a healthcare context using a discrete choice experiment with 178 participants. Based on four XAI attributes-global explanations, local explanations, presentation formats, and information quantity-16 choice sets were created. Results from a mixed logit model show that XAI enhances public understanding, with a preference for local explanations using affirmative and counterfactual information. Participants also favored concise, visually and textually integrated explanations. These findings underscore the importance of integrating XAI into public services, emphasizing local explanations and clear, visually supported formats to build trust and align with public preferences.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, has rapidly evolved and is reshaping various fields, including clinical medicine. Emergency medicine stands to benefit from AI's capacity for high-volume data processing, workflow optimization, and clinical decision support. However, important challenges exist, ranging from model "hallucinations" and data bias to questions of interpretability, liability, and ethical use in high-stake environments. This updated viewpoint provides a structured overview of AI's current capabilities in emergency medicine, highlights real-world applications, and explores concerns regarding regulatory requirements, safety standards, and transparency (explainable AI). We discuss the potential risks and limitations of LLMs, including their performance in rare or atypical presentations common in the emergency department and potential biases that could disproportionately affect vulnerable populations. We also address the regulatory landscape, particularly the liability for AI-driven decisions, and emphasize the need for clear guidelines and human oversight. Ultimately, AI holds enormous promise for improving patient care and resource management in emergency medicine; however, ensuring safety, fairness, and accountability remains vital.

AB  - Malaria and Typhoid fever are prevalent diseases in tropical regions, and both are exacerbated by unclear protocols, drug resistance, and environmental factors. Prompt and accurate diagnosis is crucial to improve accessibility and reduce mortality rates. Traditional diagnosis methods cannot effectively capture the complexities of these diseases due to the presence of similar symptoms. Although machine learning (ML) models offer accurate predictions, they operate as "black boxes" with non-interpretable decision-making processes, making it challenging for healthcare providers to comprehend how the conclusions are reached. This study employs explainable AI (XAI) models such as Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), and Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT to clarify diagnostic results for healthcare workers, building trust and transparency in medical diagnostics by describing which symptoms had the greatest impact on the model's decisions and providing clear, understandable explanations. The models were implemented on Google Colab and Visual Studio Code because of their rich libraries and extensions. Results showed that the Random Forest model outperformed the other tested models; in addition, important features were identified with the LIME plots while ChatGPT 3.5 had a comparative advantage over other LLMs. The study integrates RF, LIME, and GPT in building a mobile app to enhance the interpretability and transparency in malaria and typhoid diagnosis system. Despite its promising results, the system's performance is constrained by the quality of the dataset. Additionally, while LIME and GPT improve transparency, they may introduce complexities in real-time deployment due to computational demands and the need for internet service to maintain relevance and accuracy. The findings suggest that AI-driven diagnostic systems can significantly enhance healthcare delivery in environments with limited resources, and future works can explore the applicability of this framework to other medical conditions and datasets.

AB  - Explainable AI (XAI) is critical for clinical decision support systems (AI-CDSS) in healthcare, but current approaches often neglect the usability of explanations from a human-computer interaction (HCI) perspective. We investigate progressive disclosure as a strategy for selective transparency to provide effective explanations without overwhelming users. This paper presents a user-centered design of AI-CDSS interface prototypes that incorporate interactive explanation features (e.g., keyword highlighting of medical terms and interactive causal diagrams) and empathy-oriented nudges (e.g., supportive prompts and icons). We evaluated these prototypes through interviews with medical professionals and students, followed by a user study with general users, to assess their impact on understanding, trust, and satisfaction. Our findings suggest that progressive, on-demand disclosure of explanation details may help users manage information load and better follow the AI's reasoning process. While several interface features were well received, some elements such as affective cues like emojis elicited skepticism, particularly in clinical contexts, which underscores the importance of context-sensitive design choices.

AB  - The Internet of things (IoT)-based healthcare decision support system plays a crucial role in modern medicine, especially with the rise in chronic illnesses and an aging population necessitating continuous remote health monitoring. Current healthcare decision support systems struggle to deliver timely and accurate decisions with minimal latency due to limited real-time healthcare data and inefficient computational resources. There is a critical need for an optimized, energy-efficient machine learning model that reliably supports remote health monitoring within IoT and fog computing environments. Our study proposes an Optimized Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) and Explainable AI (XAI) binary classification model for a trustable and energy-efficient healthcare decision support system, leveraging fog computing to optimize performance. The fog-based approach improves response times and enhances bandwidth usage, addressing critical needs such as reduced latency, higher bandwidth utilization, and decreased packet loss. To further improve efficiency, we incorporate the innovative mLZW data compression technique, significantly enhancing data communication efficiency and reducing response time to critical health alerts. However, limited real-time healthcare data records challenge machine learning classification performance. By implementing a TinyML algorithm, our system demonstrates superior performance to other machine learning models. The proposed optimized TinyML model achieves an impressive F1 score of 0.93 for health abnormalities detection, emphasizing its robustness and effectiveness. This paper highlights the potential of TinyML and XAI in delivering robust, trustworthy, and energy-aware healthcare solutions, making significant contributions toward effective remote health monitoring and decision support in fog-enabled IoT networks.

AB  - The global aging population is expanding at an unprecedented rate and is projected to reach 2 billion by 2050, presenting significant medical challenges, particularly multimorbidity and heterogeneous responses to treatment. Using diabetes as an illustrative case, this study explores the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted clinical decision-making to advance personalized precision medicine for older adults. Through systematic analysis of current healthcare practices and emerging AI technologies, we examined the integration of machine learning algorithms, natural language processing, and intelligent monitoring systems into diabetes care for elderly populations. Based on current evidence showing up to 25% reduction in hospitalization rates and 30% increase in treatment adherence, we argue that AI integration represents a transformative approach to improving clinical outcomes in elderly diabetes care. We contend that AIdriven clinical decision support systems (CDSS) offer superior performance in risk prediction and treatment optimization, with studies demonstrating diagnostic accuracy rates of up to 93.07%, supporting our argument for their widespread implementation. Furthermore, AIenhanced monitoring systems improved medication adherence by 17.9% compared to conventional monitoring approaches. Nonetheless, several challenges persist, including issues related to data standardization, algorithm transparency, and patient privacy protection. These results underscore the necessity of adopting a balanced implementation strategy that addresses both technical limitations and ethical considerations, while upholding patient autonomy. This perspective emphasizes the critical importance of multidisciplinary collaboration among healthcare professionals, technology developers, and regulatory authorities in establishing a comprehensive framework for AI deployment in clinical settings. By demonstrating the capacity of AI-assisted clinical decision-making to enhance healthcare quality and efficiency for elderly patients with diabetes, this study makes a meaningful contribution to the evolving field of personalized medicine.

AB  - Cancer accounts for most deaths worldwide, and cases of brain and lung tumors are emerging at a rapid pace. Early detection is of prime importance for better patient outcomes, but the conventional methods of diagnosing cancer rely upon MRI scans, and they are timeconsuming, two-dimensional, and a potential source of inaccuracies. In India alone, more than 70,000 cases are reported of lung cancer. About 50,000 individuals have brain tumors. This research uses deep learning models-sequential model and the pre-trained VGG-16 model-to provide accurate classification for brain and lung tumors from MRI and CT images. With a combination of machine learning and image processing, the automated system reduces false negatives and false positives, thereby attaining high accuracy in diagnosis. Additionally, the use of Explainable AI (XAI) techniques improves the interpretation of predictions by healthcare professionals. These advanced, automated solutions are thus directed toward enhanced early cancer detection in the pursuit of better patient outcomes.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) can unveil novel personalized treatments based on drug screening and whole-exome sequencing experiments (WES). However, the concept of "black box" in AI limits the potential of this approach to be translated into the clinical practice. In contrast, explainable AI (XAI) focuses on making AI results understandable to humans. Here, we present a novel XAI method -called multi-dimensional module optimization (MOM)- that associates drug screening with genetic events, while guaranteeing that predictions are interpretable and robust. We applied MOM to an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cohort of 319 ex-vivo tumor samples with 122 screened drugs and WES. MOM returned a therapeutic strategy based on the FLT3, CBF beta-MYH11, and NRAS status, which predicted AML patient response to Quizartinib, Trametinib, Selumetinib, and Crizotinib. We successfully validated the results in three different large-scale screening experiments. We believe that XAI will help healthcare providers and drug regulators better understand AI medical decisions.

AB  - During the last decade, more and more Artificial Intelligence systems have been designed using complex and sophisticated architectures to reach unprecedented predictive performance. The side effect is an increase in opacity of their inner workings which is inadmissible when such systems are applied in critical domains (healthcare, finance and so on). The eXplainable AI (XAI) research field aims to overcome this limitation thus helping humans to understand black-box decisions. In this paper we propose a novel model-agnostic XAI technique, named Pivot-Aided Space Transformation for Local Explanations (PASTLE), which exploits an instance-space transformation to explain any model's predictions, aiming to enhance human trust towards the AI decisions. We experimentally evaluate the effects of the introduced space transformation on various real-world data sets and our user study reveals promising results in terms of effective explainability.

AB  - Digitization and automation have always had an immense impact on healthcare. It embraces every new and advanced technology. Recently the world has witnessed the prominence of the metaverse which is an emerging technology in digital space. The metaverse has huge potential to provide a plethora of health services seamlessly to patients and medical professionals with an immersive experience. This paper proposes the amalgamation of artificial intelligence and blockchain in the metaverse to provide better, faster, and more secure healthcare facilities in digital space with a realistic experience. Our proposed architecture can be summarized as follows. It consists of three environments, namely the doctor's environment, the patient's environment, and the metaverse environment. The doctors and patients interact in a metaverse environment assisted by blockchain technology which ensures the safety, security, and privacy of data. The metaverse environment is the main part of our proposed architecture. The doctors, patients, and nurses enter this environment by registering on the blockchain and they are represented by avatars in the metaverse environment. All the consultation activities between the doctor and the patient will be recorded and the data, i.e., images, speech, text, videos, clinical data, etc., will be gathered, transferred, and stored on the blockchain. These data are used for disease prediction and diagnosis by explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) models. The GradCAM and LIME approaches of XAI provide logical reasoning for the prediction of diseases and ensure trust, explainability, interpretability, and transparency regarding the diagnosis and prediction of diseases. Blockchain technology provides data security for patients while enabling transparency, traceability, and immutability regarding their data. These features of blockchain ensure trust among the patients regarding their data. Consequently, this proposed architecture ensures transparency and trust regarding both the diagnosis of diseases and the data security of the patient. We also explored the building block technologies of the metaverse. Furthermore, we also investigated the advantages and challenges of a metaverse in healthcare.

AB  - Thyroid illness encompasses a range of disorders affecting the thyroid gland, leading to either hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, which can significantly impact metabolism and overall health. Hypothyroidism can cause a slowdown in bodily processes, leading to symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, depression, and cold sensitivity. Hyperthyroidism can lead to increased metabolism, causing symptoms like rapid weight loss, anxiety, irritability, and heart palpitations. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment are crucial in managing thyroid disorders and improving patients' quality of life. Thyroid illness affects millions worldwide and can significantly impact their quality of life if left untreated. This research aims to propose an effective artificial intelligence-based approach for the early diagnosis of thyroid illness. An open-access thyroid disease dataset based on 3,772 male and female patient observations is used for this research experiment. This study uses the nominal continuous synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE-NC) for data balancing and a fine-tuned light gradient booster machine (LGBM) technique to diagnose thyroid illness and handle class imbalance problems. The proposed SNL (SMOTE-NC-LGBM) approach outperformed the state-of-the-art approach with high-accuracy performance scores of 0.96. We have also applied advanced machine learning and deep learning methods for comparison to evaluate performance. Hyperparameter optimizations are also conducted to enhance thyroid diagnosis performance. In addition, we have applied the explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) mechanism based on Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to enhance the transparency and interpretability of the proposed method by analyzing the decision-making processes. The proposed research revolutionizes the diagnosis of thyroid disorders efficiently and helps specialties overcome thyroid disorders early.

AB  - The accurate prediction of brain stroke is critical for effective diagnosis and management, yet the imbalanced nature of medical datasets often hampers the performance of conventional machine learning models. To address this challenge, we propose a novel meta-learning framework that integrates advanced hybrid resampling techniques, ensemble-based classifiers, and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to enhance predictive performance and interpretability. The framework employs SMOTE and SMOTEENN for handling class imbalance, dynamic feature selection to reduce noise, and a meta-learning approach combining predictions from Random Forest and LightGBM, and further refined by a deep learning-based meta-classifier. The model uses SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) to provide transparent insights into feature contributions, increasing trust in its predictions. Evaluated on three datasets, DF-1, DF-2, and DF-3, the proposed framework consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods, achieving accuracy and F1-Score of 0.992189 and 0.992579 on DF-1, 0.980297 and 0.981916 on DF-2, and 0.981901 and 0.983365 on DF-3. These results validate the robustness and effectiveness of the approach, significantly improving the detection of minority-class instances while maintaining overall performance. This work establishes a reliable solution for stroke prediction and provides a foundation for applying meta-learning and explainable AI to other imbalanced medical prediction tasks.

AB  - With the advent of machine learning in applications of critical infrastructure such as healthcare and energy, privacy is a growing concern in the minds of stakeholders. It is pivotal to ensure that neither the model nor the data can be used to extract sensitive information used by attackers against individuals or to harm whole societies through the exploitation of critical infrastructure. The applicability of machine learning in these domains is mostly limited due to a lack of trust regarding the transparency and the privacy constraints. Various safety-critical use cases (mostly relying on time-series data) are currently underrepresented in privacy-related considerations. By evaluating several privacy-preserving methods regarding their applicability on time-series data, we validated the inefficacy of encryption for deep learning, the strong dataset dependence of differential privacy, and the broad applicability of federated methods.

AB  - Complex "black-box" artificial intelligence (AI) models are interpreted using interpretive machine learning and explainable AI (XAI); therefore, assessing the importance of global and local features is crucial. The previously proposed approximate inverse model explanation (AIME) offers unified explanations of global and local feature importance. This study builds on that foundation by focusing on assessing feature contributions while also examining the multicollinearity and correlation among features in XAI-derived explanations. Given that advanced AI and machine learning models inherently manage multicollinearity and correlations among features, XAI methods must be employed to clearly explain these dynamics and fully understand the estimation results and behaviors of the models. This study proposes a new technique called principal component analysis-enhanced approximate inverse model explanation (PCAIME) that extends AIME and implements dimensionality decomposition and expansion capabilities, such as PCA. PCAIME derives contributing features, demonstrates the multicollinearity and correlation between features and their contributions through a two-dimensional heat map of principal components, and reveals selected features after dimensionality reduction. Experiments using wine quality and automobile mile-per-gallon datasets were conducted to compare the effectiveness of local interpretable model-agnostic explanations, AIME, and PCAIME, particularly in analyzing local feature importance. PCAIME outperformed its counterparts by effectively revealing feature correlations and providing a more comprehensive perspective of feature interactions. Significantly, PCAIME estimated the global and local feature importance and offered novel insights by simultaneously visualizing feature correlations through heat maps. PCAIME could improve the understanding of complex algorithms and datasets, promoting transparent AI and machine learning in healthcare, finance, and public policy.

AB  - Nowadays Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a fundamental component of healthcare applications, both clinical and remote, but the best performing AI systems are often too complex to be self-explaining. Explainable AI (XAI) techniques are defined to unveil the reasoning behind the system's predictions and decisions, and they become even more critical when dealing with sensitive and personal health data. It is worth noting that XAI has not gathered the same attention across different research areas and data types, especially in healthcare. In particular, many clinical and remote health applications are based on tabular and time series data, respectively, and XAI is not commonly analysed on these data types, while computer vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) are the reference applications. To provide an overview of XAI methods that are most suitable for tabular and time series data in the healthcare domain, this paper provides a review of the literature in the last 5 years, illustrating the type of generated explanations and the efforts provided to evaluate their relevance and quality. Specifically, we identify clinical validation, consistency assessment, objective and standardised quality evaluation, and human-centered quality assessment as key features to ensure effective explanations for the end users. Finally, we highlight the main research challenges in the field as well as the limitations of existing XAI methods.

AB  - Background: Skin cancer, particularly melanoma, poses significant challenges due to the heterogeneity of skin images and the demand for accurate and interpretable diagnostic systems. Early detection and effective management are crucial for improving patient outcomes. Traditional AI models often struggle with balancing accuracy and interpretability, which are critical for clinical adoption. Methods: The SmartSkin-XAI methodology incorporates a fine-tuned DenseNet121 model combined with XAI techniques to interpret predictions. This approach improves early detection and patient management by offering a transparent decision-making process. The model was evaluated using two datasets: the ISIC dataset and the Kaggle dataset. Performance metrics such as classification accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score were compared against benchmark models, including DenseNet121, InceptionV3, and esNet50. Results: SmartSkin-XAI achieved a classification accuracy of 97% on the ISIC dataset and 98% on the Kaggle dataset. The model demonstrated high stability in precision, recall, and F1 score measures, outperforming the benchmark models. These results underscore the robustness and applicability of SmartSkin-XAI for real-world healthcare scenarios. Conclusions: SmartSkin-XAI addresses critical challenges in melanoma diagnosis by integrating state-of-the-art architecture with XAI methods, providing both accuracy and interpretability. This approach enhances clinical decision-making, fosters trust among healthcare professionals, and represents a significant advancement in incorporating AI-driven diagnostics into medicine, particularly for bedside applications.

AB  - BackgroundHospital readmission following renal transplantation significantly impacts patient outcomes and healthcare resources. While machine learning approaches offer promising solutions for risk prediction, their clinical application often lacks interpretability. We developed an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) based supervised learning model to predict 30-day hospital readmission risk following renal transplantation.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective analysis of 588 renal transplant recipients at King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, with a predominance of living donor transplants (85.2%, n = 500). Our methodology included a four-stage machine learning pipeline: data processing, feature preparation, model development using stratified 5-fold cross-validation, and clinical validation. Multiple algorithms were evaluated, with gradient boosting demonstrating superior performance. Model interpretability was achieved through dual-approach analysis using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations).ResultsThe gradient boosting model demonstrated strong performance (AUC 0.837, 95% CI: 0.802-0.872) with accuracy of 0.796 +/- 0.050 and sensitivity of 0.388 +/- 0.129. Length of hospital stay (38.0% contribution) and post-transplant systolic blood pressure (30.0% contribution) emerged as primary predictors, with differences between living and deceased donor subgroups. Pre-transplant BMI showed a higher importance in deceased donor recipients (12.6% vs. 2.6%), while HbA1c and eGFR were more impacting in living donor outcomes. The readmission rate in our cohort (88.9%, n = 523) was higher than previously reported ranges (18-47%), likely reflecting center-specific practices.ConclusionsOur XAI-based machine learning model combines strong predictive performance with clinical interpretability, offering transplant physicians donor-specific risk stratification capabilities. The web-based implementation facilitates practical integration into clinical workflows. Given our single-center experience and high proportion of living donors, external validation across diverse transplant centers is essential before widespread implementation. Our approach establishes a framework for developing center-specific risk prediction tools in transplant medicine.

AB  - This work aimed to evaluate both the usefulness and user acceptance of five gradient-based explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods in the use case of a prostate carcinoma clinical decision support system environment. In addition, we aimed to determine whether XAI helps to increase the acceptance of artificial intelligence (AI) and recommend a particular method for this use case. The evaluation was conducted on a tool developed in-house with different visualization approaches to the AI-generated Gleason grade and the corresponding XAI explanations on top of the original slide. The study was a heuristic evaluation of five XAI methods. The participants were 15 pathologists from the University Hospital of Augsburg with a wide range of experience in Gleason grading and AI. The evaluation consisted of a user information form, short questionnaires on each XAI method, a ranking of the methods, and a general questionnaire to evaluate the performance and usefulness of the AI. There were significant differences between the ratings of the methods, with Grad-CAM++ performing best. Both AI decision support and XAI explanations were seen as helpful by the majority of participants. In conclusion, our pilot study suggests that the evaluated XAI methods can indeed improve the usefulness and acceptance of AI. The results obtained are a good indicator, but further studies involving larger sample sizes are warranted to draw more definitive conclusions.

AB  - Machine learning tools are increasingly used to improve the quality of care and the soundness of a treatment plan. Explainable AI (XAI) helps users in understanding the inner mechanisms of opaque machine learning models and is a driver of trust and adoption. Explanation methods for black-box models exist, but there is a lack of user studies on the interpretability of the provided explanations. We used a Think Aloud Protocol (TAP) to explore oncologists' assessment of a lung cancer relapse prediction system with the aim of refining the purpose-built explanation model for better credibility and utility. Novel to this context, TAP is used as a neutral methodology to elicit experts' thought processes and judgements of the AI system, without explicit prompts. TAP aims to elicit the factors which influenced clinicians' perception of credibility and usefulness of the system. Ten oncologists took part in the study. We conducted a thematic analysis of their verbalized responses, generating five themes that help us to understand the context within which oncologists' may (or may not) integrate an explainable AI system into their working day.

AB  - Glioma represents a dominant primary intracranial malignancy in the central nervous system. Artificial intelli-gence that mainly includes machine learning, and deep learning computational approaches, presents a unique opportunity to enhance clinical management of glioma through improving tumor segmentation, diagnosis, dif-ferentiation, grading, treatment, prediction of clinical outcomes (prognosis, and recurrence), molecular features, clinical classification, characterization of the tumor microenvironment, and drug discovery. A growing body of recent studies apply artificial intelligence-based models to disparate data sources of glioma, covering imaging modalities, digital pathology, high-throughput multi-omics data (especially emerging single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptome), etc. While these early findings are promising, future studies are required to normalize artificial intelligence-based models to improve the generalizability and interpretability of the results. Despite prominent issues, targeted clinical application of artificial intelligence approaches in glioma will facilitate the development of precision medicine of this field. If these challenges can be overcome, artificial intelligence has the potential to profoundly change the way patients with or at risk of glioma are provided with more rational care.

AB  - Background/Objective: Gastric cancer (GC) is a complex disease representing a significant global health concern. Advanced tools for the early diagnosis and prediction of adverse outcomes are crucial. In this context, artificial intelligence (AI) plays a fundamental role. The aim of this work was to develop a diagnostic and prognostic tool for GC, providing support to clinicians in critical decision-making and enabling personalised strategies. Methods: Different machine learning and deep learning techniques were explored to build diagnostic and prognostic models, ensuring model interpretability and transparency through explainable AI methods. These models were developed and cross-validated using data from 590 Spanish Caucasian patients with primary GC and 633 cancer-free individuals. Up to 261 variables were analysed, including demographic, environmental, clinical, tumoral, and genetic data. Variables such as Helicobacter pylori infection, tobacco use, family history of GC, TNM staging, metastasis, tumour location, treatment received, gender, age, and genetic factors (single nucleotide polymorphisms) were selected as inputs due to their association with the risk and progression of the disease. Results: The XGBoost algorithm (version 1.7.4) achieved the best performance for diagnosis, with an AUC value of 0.68 using 5-fold cross-validation. As for prognosis, the Random Survival Forest algorithm achieved a C-index of 0.77. Of interest, the incorporation of genetic data into the clinical-demographics models significantly increased discriminatory ability in both diagnostic and prognostic models. Conclusions: This article presents GastricAITool, a simple and intuitive decision support tool for the diagnosis and prognosis of GC.

AB  - Purpose of reviewThe integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in the diagnosis and management of anterior segment diseases has rapidly expanded, demonstrating significant potential to revolutionize clinical practice.Recent findingsAI technologies, including machine learning and deep learning models, are increasingly applied in the detection and management of a variety of conditions, such as corneal diseases, refractive surgery, cataract, conjunctival disorders (e.g., pterygium), trachoma, and dry eye disease. By analyzing large-scale imaging data and clinical information, AI enhances diagnostic accuracy, predicts treatment outcomes, and supports personalized patient care.SummaryAs AI models continue to evolve, particularly with the use of large models and generative AI techniques, they will further refine diagnosis and treatment planning. While challenges remain, including issues related to data diversity and model interpretability, AI's integration into ophthalmology promises to improve healthcare outcomes, making it a cornerstone of data-driven medical practice. The continued development and application of AI will undoubtedly transform the future of anterior segment ophthalmology, leading to more efficient, accurate, and individualized care.

AB  - While stroke is one of the leading causes of disability, the prediction of upper limb (UL) functional recovery following rehabilitation is still unsatisfactory, hampered by the clinical complexity of post-stroke impairment. Predictive models leading to accurate estimates while revealing which features contribute most to the predictions are the key to unveil the mechanisms subserving the post-intervention recovery, prompting a new focus on individualized treatments and precision medicine in stroke. Machine learning (ML) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) are emerging as the enabling technology in different fields, being promising tools also in clinics. In this study, we had the twofold goal of evaluating whether ML can allow deriving accurate predictions of UL recovery in sub-acute patients, and disentangling the contribution of the variables shaping the outcomes. To do so, Random Forest equipped with four XAI methods was applied to interpret the results and assess the feature relevance and their consensus. Our results revealed increased performance when using ML compared to conventional statistical approaches. Moreover, the features deemed as the most relevant were concordant across the XAI methods, suggesting good stability of the results. In particular, the baseline motor impairment as measured by simple clinical scales had the largest impact, as expected. Our findings highlight the core role of ML not only for accurately predicting the individual outcome scores after rehabilitation, but also for making ML results interpretable when associated to XAI methods. This provides clinicians with robust predictions and reliable explanations that are key factors in therapeutic planning/monitoring of stroke patients.

AB  - The amount of data generated in the field of laboratory medicine has grown to an extent that conventional laboratory information systems (LISs) are struggling to manage and analyze this complex, entangled information ("Big Data"). Statistical learning, a generalized framework from machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) is predestined for processing "Big Data" and holds the potential to revolutionize the field of laboratory medicine. Personalized medicine may in particular benefit from AI-based systems, especially when coupled with readily available wearables and smartphones which can collect health data from individual patients and offer new, cost-effective access routes to healthcare for patients worldwide. The amount of personal data collected, however, also raises concerns about patient-privacy and calls for clear ethical guidelines for "Big Data" research, including rigorous quality checks of data and algorithms to eliminate underlying bias and enable transparency. Likewise, novel federated privacy-preserving data processing approaches may reduce the need for centralized data storage. Generative AI-systems including large language models such as ChatGPT currently enter the stage to reshape clinical research, clinical decision-support systems, and healthcare delivery. In our opinion, AI-based systems have a tremendous potential to transform laboratory medicine, however, their opportunities should be weighed against the risks carefully. Despite all enthusiasm, we advocate for stringent added-value assessments, just as for any new drug or treatment. Human experts should carefully validate AI-based systems, including patient-privacy protection, to ensure quality, transparency, and public acceptance. In this opinion paper, data prerequisites, recent developments, chances, and limitations of statistical learning approaches are highlighted.

AB  - Artificial intelligence algorithms have become extensively utilized in survival analysis for high-dimensional, multi-source data. However, due to their complexity, these methods often yield poorly interpretable outcomes, posing challenges in the analysis of several conditions. One of these conditions is obstructive sleep apnea, a sleep disorder characterized by the simultaneous occurrence of comorbidities. Survival analysis provides a potential solution for assessing and categorizing the severity of obstructive sleep apnea, aiding personalized treatment strategies. Given the critical role of time in such scenarios and considering limitations in model interpretability, time-dependent explainable artificial intelligence algorithms have been developed in recent years for direct application to basic Machine Learning models, such as Cox regression and survival random forest. Our work aims to enhance model selection in OSA survival analysis using time-dependent XAI for Machine Learning and Deep Learning models. We developed an end-to-end pipeline, training several survival models and selecting the best performers. Our top models-Cox regression, Cox time, and logistic hazard-achieved good performance, with C-index scores of 0.81, 0.78, and 0.77, and Brier scores of 0.10, 0.12, and 0.11 on the test set. We applied SurvSHAP methods to Cox regression and logistic hazard to investigate their behavior. Although the models showed similar performance, our analysis established that the results of the log hazard model were more reliable and useful in clinical practice compared to those of Cox regression in OSA scenarios.

KW  - safety assurance
AB  - Established approaches to assuring safety-critical systems and software are difficult to apply to systems employing ML where there is no clear, pre-defined specification against which to assess validity. This problem is exacerbated by the "opaque " nature of ML where the learnt model is not amenable to human scrutiny. Explainable AI (XAI) methods have been proposed to tackle this issue by producing human-interpretable representations of ML models which can help users to gain confidence and build trust in the ML system. However, little work explicitly investigates the role of explainability for safety assurance in the context of ML development. This paper identifies ways in which XAI methods can contribute to safety assurance of ML-based systems. It then uses a concrete ML-based clinical decision support system, concerning weaning of patients from mechanical ventilation, to demonstrate how XAI methods can be employed to produce evidence to support safety assurance. The results are also represented in a safety argument to show where, and in what way, XAI methods can contribute to a safety case. Overall, we conclude that XAI methods have a valuable role in safety assurance of ML-based systems in healthcare but that they are not sufficient in themselves to assure safety.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects over 850 million individuals worldwide, yet conventional risk stratification approaches fail to capture complex disease progression patterns. Current machine learning approaches suffer from inefficient parameter optimization and limited clinical interpretability. We developed an integrated framework combining advanced Bayesian optimization with explainable artificial intelligence for enhanced CKD risk assessment. Our approach employs XGBoost ensemble learning with intelligent parameter optimization through Optuna (a Bayesian optimization framework) and comprehensive interpretability analysis using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to explain model predictions. To address algorithmic "black-box" limitations and enhance clinical trustworthiness, we implemented four-tier risk stratification using stratified cross-validation and balanced evaluation metrics that ensure equitable performance across all patient risk categories, preventing bias toward common cases while maintaining sensitivity for high-risk patients. The optimized model achieved exceptional performance with 92.4% accuracy, 91.9% F1-score, and 97.7% ROC-AUC, significantly outperforming 16 baseline algorithms by 7.9-18.9%. Bayesian optimization reduced computational time by 74% compared to traditional grid search while maintaining robust generalization. Model interpretability analysis identified CKD stage, albumin-creatinine ratio, and estimated glomerular filtration rate as primary predictors, fully aligning with established clinical guidelines. This framework delivers superior predictive accuracy while providing transparent, clinically-meaningful explanations for CKD risk stratification, addressing critical challenges in medical AI deployment: computational efficiency, algorithmic transparency, and equitable performance across diverse patient populations.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the critical need for advanced technology in healthcare. Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) have emerged as one of the most promising technologies for improving patient outcomes. This study's focus on developing a deep state-space model (DSSM) is of utmost importance, as it addresses the current limitations of AI predictive models in handling high-dimensional and longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs). The DSSM's ability to capture time-varying information from unstructured medical notes, combined with label-dependent attention for interpretability, will allow for more accurate risk prediction for patients. As we move into a post-COVID-19 era, the importance of CDSS in precision medicine cannot be ignored. This study's contribution to the development of DSSM for unstructured medical notes has the potential to greatly improve patient care and outcomes in the future.

AB  - State-of-the-art healthcare technologies are incorporating advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, allowing for rapid and easy disease diagnosis. However, most AI models are considered "black boxes," because there is no explanation for the decisions made by these models. Users may find it challenging to comprehend and interpret the results. Explainable AI (XAI) can explain the machine learning (ML) outputs and contribution of features in disease prediction models. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a potential predictive tool for understanding cortical impairment caused by an ischemic stroke and can be utilized for acute stroke prediction, neurologic prognosis, and post-stroke treatment. This study aims to utilize ML models to classify the ischemic stroke group and the healthy control group for acute stroke prediction in active states. Moreover, XAI tools (Eli5 and LIME) were utilized to explain the behavior of the model and determine the significant features that contribute to stroke prediction models. In this work, we studied 48 patients admitted to a hospital with acute ischemic stroke and 75 healthy adults who had no history of identified other neurological illnesses. EEG was obtained within three months following the onset of ischemic stroke symptoms using frontal, central, temporal, and occipital cortical electrodes (Fz, C1, T7, Oz). EEG data were collected in an active state (walking, working, and reading tasks). In the results of the ML approach, the Adaptive Gradient Boosting models showed around 80% accuracy for the classification of the control group and the stroke group. Eli5 and LIME were utilized to explain the behavior of the stroke prediction model and interpret the model locally around the prediction. The Eli5 and LIME interpretable models emphasized the spectral delta and theta features as local contributors to stroke prediction. From the findings of this explainable AI research, it is expected that the stroke-prediction XAI model will help with post-stroke treatment and recovery, as well as help healthcare professionals, make their diagnostic decisions more explainable.

AB  - Objective To develop and evaluate a data-driven process to generate suggestions for improving alert criteria using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approaches.Methods We extracted data on alerts generated from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020, at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. We developed machine learning models to predict user responses to alerts. We applied XAI techniques to generate global explanations and local explanations. We evaluated the generated suggestions by comparing with alert's historical change logs and stakeholder interviews. Suggestions that either matched (or partially matched) changes already made to the alert or were considered clinically correct were classified as helpful.Results The final dataset included 2 991 823 firings with 2689 features. Among the 5 machine learning models, the LightGBM model achieved the highest Area under the ROC Curve: 0.919 [0.918, 0.920]. We identified 96 helpful suggestions. A total of 278 807 firings (9.3%) could have been eliminated. Some of the suggestions also revealed workflow and education issues.Conclusion We developed a data-driven process to generate suggestions for improving alert criteria using XAI techniques. Our approach could identify improvements regarding clinical decision support (CDS) that might be overlooked or delayed in manual reviews. It also unveils a secondary purpose for the XAI: to improve quality by discovering scenarios where CDS alerts are not accepted due to workflow, education, or staffing issues.

AB  - We present an explainable artificial intelligence methodology for predicting mortality in patients. We combine clinical data from an electronic patient healthcare record system with factors relevant for severe mental illness and then apply machine learning. The machine learning model is used to predict mortality in patients with severe mental illness. Our methodology uses class-contrastive reasoning. We show how machine learning scientists can use class-contrastive reasoning to generate complex explanations that explain machine model predictions and data. An example of a complex class-contrastive explanation is the following: "The patient is predicted to have a low probability of death because the patient has self-harmed before, and was at some point on medications such as first-generation and second-generation antipsychotics. There are 11 other patients with these characteristics. If the patient did not have these characteristics, the prediction would be different". This can be used to generate new hypotheses, which can be tested in follow-up studies. Diuretics seemed to be associated with a lower probability of mortality (as predicted by the machine learning model) in a group of patients with cardiovascular disease. The combination of delirium and dementia in Alzheimer's disease may also predispose some patients towards a higher probability of predicted mortality. Our technique can be employed to create intricate explanations from healthcare data and possibly other areas where explainability is important. We hope this will be a step towards explainable AI in personalized medicine.

AB  - BackgroundThis study aims to address the gap in understanding clinicians' attitudes toward explainable AI (XAI) methods applied to machine learning models using tabular data, commonly found in clinical settings. It specifically explores clinicians' perceptions of different XAI methods from the ALFABETO project, which predicts COVID-19 patient hospitalization based on clinical, laboratory, and chest X-ray at time of presentation to the Emergency Department. The focus is on two cognitive dimensions: understandability and actionability of the explanations provided by explainable-by-design and post-hoc methods.MethodsA questionnaire-based experiment was conducted with 10 clinicians from the IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation in Pavia, Italy. Each clinician evaluated 10 real-world cases, rating predictions and explanations from three XAI tools: Bayesian networks, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and AraucanaXAI. Two cognitive statements for each method were rated on a Likert scale, as well as the agreement with the prediction. Two clinicians answered the survey during think-aloud interviews.ResultsClinicians demonstrated generally positive attitudes toward AI, but high compliance rates (86% on average) indicate a risk of automation bias. Understandability and actionability are positively correlated, with SHAP being the preferred method due to its simplicity. However, the perception of methods varies according to specialty and expertise.ConclusionsThe findings suggest that SHAP and AraucanaXAI are promising candidates for improving the use of XAI in clinical decision support systems (DSSs), highlighting the importance of clinicians' expertise, specialty, and setting on the selection and development of supportive XAI advice. Finally, the study provides valuable insights into the design of future XAI DSSs.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare, enabling advances in diagnostics, treatment optimization, and patient care. Yet, its integration raises ethical, regulatory, and societal challenges. Key concerns include data privacy risks, algorithmic bias, and regulatory gaps that struggle to keep pace with AI advancements. This study aims to synthesize a multidisciplinary framework for trustworthy AI in healthcare, focusing on transparency, accountability, fairness, sustainability, and global collaboration. It moves beyond high-level ethical discussions to provide actionable strategies for implementing trustworthy AI in clinical contexts. Methods: A structured literature review was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Studies were selected based on relevance to AI ethics, governance, and policy in healthcare, prioritizing peer-reviewed articles, policy analyses, case studies, and ethical guidelines from authoritative sources published within the last decade. The conceptual approach integrates perspectives from clinicians, ethicists, policymakers, and technologists, offering a holistic "ecosystem" view of AI. No clinical trials or patient-level interventions were conducted. Results: The analysis identifies key gaps in current AI governance and introduces the Regulatory Genome-an adaptive AI oversight framework aligned with global policy trends and Sustainable Development Goals. It introduces quantifiable trustworthiness metrics, a comparative analysis of AI categories for clinical applications, and bias mitigation strategies. Additionally, it presents interdisciplinary policy recommendations for aligning AI deployment with ethical, regulatory, and environmental sustainability goals. This study emphasizes measurable standards, multi-stakeholder engagement strategies, and global partnerships to ensure that future AI innovations meet ethical and practical healthcare needs. Conclusions: Trustworthy AI in healthcare requires more than technical advancements-it demands robust ethical safeguards, proactive regulation, and continuous collaboration. By adopting the recommended roadmap, stakeholders can foster responsible innovation, improve patient outcomes, and maintain public trust in AI-driven healthcare.

AB  - As artificial intelligence systems gain traction, their trustworthiness becomes paramount to harness their benefits and mitigate risks. This study underscores the pressing need for an expectation management framework to align stakeholder anticipations before any system-related activities, such as data collection, modeling, or implementation. To this end, we introduce a comprehensive framework tailored to capture end-user expectations specifically for trustworthy artificial intelligence systems. To ensure its relevance and robustness, we validated the framework via semi-structured interviews, encompassing questions rooted in the framework's constructs and principles. These interviews engaged fourteen diverse end users across the healthcare and education sectors, including physicians, teachers, and students. Through a meticulous qualitative analysis of the interview transcripts, we unearthed pivotal themes and discerned varying perspectives among the interviewee groups. Ultimately, our framework stands as a pivotal tool, paving the way for in-depth discussions about user expectations, illuminating the significance of various system attributes, and spotlighting potential challenges that might jeopardize the system's efficacy.

AB  - Black box machine learning models are currently being used for high-stakes decision making in various parts of society such as healthcare and criminal justice. While tree-based ensemble methods such as random forests typically outperform deep learning models on tabular data sets, their built-in variable importance algorithms are known to be strongly biased toward high-entropy features. It was recently shown that the increasingly popular SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values suffer from a similar bias. We propose debiased or "shrunk" SHAP scores based on sample splitting which additionally enable the detection of overfitting issues at the feature level.

AB  - Healthcare data analysis has emerged as one of the most promising fields of study in recent years. There are different types of data in the healthcare industry, such as medical test results, blood reports, medical reports, X-rays, CT, MRI, ultrasound, clinical data, omics data, and sensor data. One of the most important and useful techniques for analysing this complicated medical data is machine learning (ML). ML is proving to be a useful artificial intelligence (AI) technique for data analysis. To accurately predict the outcomes of healthcare data, ML employs a variety of statistical techniques and cutting-edge algorithms. In recent years, different ML approaches have been applied to a variety of medical data for disease diagnosis. The paper provides a comprehensive literature survey based on ML techniques to diagnose various diseases. ML importance in the analysis of medical data is discussed with applications. This paper will motivate advanced research in machine intelligence-driven healthcare by showing its potential in healthcare data analysis. We also discuss the challenges that arise when applying ML to healthcare data. Furthermore, this study introduces a new approach to ensemble learning through explainable stacking. By integrating explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques with the stacking method, we aim to not only enhance predictive accuracy but also improve the interpretability of the stacking model. The proposed predictive model outperforms the existing categorisation models, enhancing both the performance and efficiency of the diagnostic process. In addition, we suggest several future directions for further work in this area.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) systems have demonstrated impressive performance across a variety of clinical tasks. However, notoriously, sometimes these systems are "black boxes. " The initial response in the literature was a demand for "explainable AI. " However, recently, several authors have suggested that making AI more explainable or "interpretable " is likely to be at the cost of the accuracy of these systems and that prioritizing interpretability in medical AI may constitute a "lethal prejudice. " In this article, we defend the value of interpretability in the context of the use of AI in medicine. Clinicians may prefer interpretable systems over more accurate black boxes, which in turn is sufficient to give designers of AI reason to prefer more interpretable systems in order to ensure that AI is adopted and its benefits realized. Moreover, clinicians may be justified in this preference. Achieving the downstream benefits from AI is critically dependent on how the outputs of these systems are interpreted by physicians and patients. A preference for the use of highly accurate black box AI systems, over less accurate but more interpretable systems, may itself constitute a form of lethal prejudice that may diminish the benefits of AI to-and perhaps even harm-patients.

TI  - Explainable quantum-enhanced machine learning for hypertension prediction
T2  - EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL-SPECIAL TOPICS
LA  - English
AB  - Chronic disease prediction presents ongoing challenges in healthcare, primarily due to the complexity of medical data and the need for models that are both accurate and interpretable. This study introduces a quantum-enhanced machine learning model specifically designed for the prediction of hypertension, combining quantum feature transformation with classical algorithms to deliver precise and reliable results. The model demonstrates high performance, achieving an accuracy of 98.40%, precision of 99.3%, recall of 98.6%, and an F1-score of 98.9%. To ensure transparency and facilitate clinical interpretation, explainable AI (XAI) techniques are employed through SHAP values, highlighting critical factors such as hypertension drug usage, age, ferritin, and cholesterol levels as key contributors to hypertension prediction. This quantum-based approach exemplifies the potential for leveraging cutting-edge technologies in healthcare, offering a robust solution that not only ensures predictive accuracy but also supports interpretability-essential for informed clinical decision-making. The integration of quantum computing and explainable machine learning represents a promising step forward in the development of predictive models tailored to complex medical datasets.

AB  - Background: Individuals presenting with psychiatric complaints to the emergency department (ED) are at significant risk of re-referral for suicidal thoughts and behaviours (STB) in the short term. The absence of effective tools to identify these high-risk individuals hampers clinical decision-making, necessitating the development of improved, interpretable, and personalised prediction methods. We aimed to predict the risk of suicide ideation (SI) and suicide attempt (SA) within one, six, and 12 months using XGBoost algorithms; and enhance model interpretability through methods in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Methods: This prognostic study conducted the initial development and evaluation of machine learning (ML) models using structured electronic health records (EHR) from 26,198 patients (51,397 referrals) at the psychiatric emergency department (PED) of the University Hospitals Leuven, Belgium, from January 1, 2002, to December 31, 2022. Results: The models achieved good discriminative ability (Area Under the Curve) ranging from 0.70 [95 % CI: 0.66 to 0.75] to 0.80 [95 % CI: 0.75 to 0.85] and excellent calibration, with Integrated Calibration Index values ranging from 0.001 to 0.004 suggesting reliable predictions. The referrals identified within the five highest-risk ventiles comprised 24.73-26.19 % of all referrals, which accounted for 50.43 % -70 % of all STB referrals. The models exceeded the minimum criteria for cost-effective targeting of active contact and follow-up interventions. Applying XAI methods improved the transparency and interpretability of the predictions on a patient level. Conclusion: Enhancing ML models based on PED EHRs with methods in local XAI has the potential to aid clinicians in effectively identifying high-risk individuals for targeted, cost-effective interventions.

AB  - Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) elucidates the decision-making process of complex AI models and is important in building trust in model predictions. XAI explanations themselves require evaluation as to accuracy and reasonableness and in the context of use of the underlying AI model. This review details the evaluation of XAI in cardiac AI applications and has found that, of the studies examined, 37% evaluated XAI quality using literature results, 11% used clinicians as domain-experts, 11% used proxies or statistical analysis, with the remaining 43% not assessing the XAI used at all. We aim to inspire additional studies within healthcare, urging researchers not only to apply XAI methods but to systematically assess the resulting explanations, as a step towards developing trustworthy and safe models.

AB  - Introduction A brain tumor is a collection of abnormal cells in the brain that can become life-threatening due to its ability to spread. Therefore, a prompt and meticulous classification of the brain tumor is an essential element in healthcare care. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the central resource for producing high-quality images of soft tissue and is considered the principal technology for diagnosing brain tumors. Recently, computer vision techniques such as deep learning (DL) have played an important role in the classification of brain tumors, most of which use traditional centralized classification models, which face significant challenges due to the insufficient availability of diverse and representative datasets and exacerbate the difficulties in obtaining a transparent model. This study proposes a collaborative federated learning model (CFLM) with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to mitigate existing problems using state-of-the-art methods.Methods The proposed method addresses four class classification problems to identify glioma, meningioma, no tumor, and pituitary tumors. We have integrated GoogLeNet with a federated learning (FL) framework to facilitate collaborative learning on multiple devices to maintain the privacy of sensitive information locally. Moreover, this study also focuses on the interpretability to make the model transparent using Gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) and saliency map visualizations.Results In total, 10 clients were selected for the proposed model with 50 communication rounds, each with decentralized local datasets for training. The proposed approach achieves 94% classification accuracy. Moreover, we incorporate Grad-CAM with heat maps and saliency maps to offer interpretability and meaningful graphical interpretations for healthcare specialists.Conclusion This study outlines an efficient and interpretable model for brain tumor classification by introducing an integrated technique using FL with GoogLeNet architecture. The proposed framework has great potential to improve brain tumor classification to make them more reliable and transparent for clinical use.

AB  - Healthcare providers, policymakers, and defense contractors need to understand many types of machine learning model behaviors. While eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) provides tools for interpreting these behaviors, few frameworks, surveys, and taxonomies produce succinct yet general notation to help researchers and practitioners describe their explainability needs and quantify whether these needs are met. Such quantified comparisons could help individuals rank XAI methods by their relevance to use-cases, select explanations best suited for individual users, and evaluate what explanations are most useful for describing model behaviors. This paper collects, decomposes, and abstracts subcomponents of common XAI methods to identify a mathematically grounded syntax that applies generally to describing modern and future explanation types while remaining useful for discovering novel XAI methods. The resulting syntax, introduced as the Qi-Framework, generally defines explanation types in terms of the information being explained, their utility to inspectors, and the methods and information used to produce explanations. Just as programming languages define syntax to structure, simplify, and standardize software development, so too the Qi-Framework acts as a common language to help researchers and practitioners select, compare, and discover XAI methods. Derivative works may extend and implement the Qi-Framework to develop a more rigorous science for interpretable machine learning and inspire collaborative competition across XAI research.

AB  - This study introduces a novel framework leveraging Rough Set Theory (RST)-based feature selection-MLReduct, MLSpecialReduct, and MLFuzzyRoughSet-to enhance machine learning performance on uncertain data. Applied to a private cardiovascular dataset, our MLSpecialReduct algorithm achieves a peak Random Forest accuracy of 0.99 (versus 0.85 without feature selection), while MLFuzzyRoughSet improves accuracy to 0.83, surpassing our MLVarianceThreshold (0.72-0.77), an adaptation of the traditional VarianceThreshold method. We integrate these RST techniques with preprocessing (discretization, normalization, encoding) and compare them against traditional approaches across classifiers like Random Forest and Naive Bayes. The results underscore RST's edge in accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability, with MLSpecialReduct leading in minimal attribute reduction. Against baseline classifiers without feature selection and MLVarianceThreshold, our framework delivers significant improvements, establishing RST as a vital tool for explainable AI (XAI) in healthcare diagnostics and IoT systems. These findings open avenues for future hybrid RST-ML models, providing a robust, interpretable solution for complex data challenges.

AB  - Modern medicine is supported by increasingly sophisticated algorithms. In diagnostics or screening, statistical models are commonly used to assess the risk of disease development, the severity of its course, and expected treatment outcome. The growing availability of very detailed data and increased interest in personalized medicine are leading to the development of effective but complex machine learning models. For these models to be trusted, their predictions must be understandable to both the physician and the patient, hence the growing interest in the area of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). In this paper, we present selected methods from the XAI field in the example of models applied to assess lung cancer risk in lung cancer screening through low-dose computed tomography. The use of these techniques provides a better understanding of the similarities and differences between three commonly used models in lung cancer screening, i.e., BACH, PLCOm2012, and LCART. For the presentation of the results, we used data from the Domestic Lung Cancer Database. The XAI techniques help to better understand (1) which variables are most important in which model, (2) how they are transformed into model predictions, and facilitate (3) the explanation of model predictions for a particular screenee.

AB  - The prevalence of dementia is growing worldwide due to the fast ageing of the population. Dementia is an intricate illness that is frequently produced by a mixture of genetic and environmental risk factors. There is no treatment for dementia yet; therefore, the early detection and identification of persons at greater risk of emerging dementia becomes crucial, as this might deliver an opportunity to adopt lifestyle variations to decrease the risk of dementia. Many dementia risk prediction techniques to recognize individuals at high risk have progressed in the past few years. Accepting a structure uniting explainability in artificial intelligence (XAI) with intricate systems will enable us to classify analysts of dementia incidence and then verify their occurrence in the survey as recognized or suspected risk factors. Deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) are current techniques for detecting and classifying dementia and making decisions without human participation. This study introduces a Leveraging Explainability Artificial Intelligence and Optimization Algorithm for Accurate Dementia Prediction and Classification Model (LXAIOA-ADPCM) technique in medical diagnosis. The main intention of the LXAIOA-ADPCM technique is to progress a novel algorithm for dementia prediction using advanced techniques. Initially, data normalization is performed by utilizing min-max normalization to convert input data into a beneficial format. Furthermore, the feature selection process is performed by implementing the naked mole-rat algorithm (NMRA) model. For the classification process, the proposed LXAIOA-ADPCM model implements ensemble classifiers such as the bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), sparse autoencoder (SAE), and temporal convolutional network (TCN) techniques. Finally, the hyperparameter selection of ensemble models is accomplished by utilizing the gazelle optimization algorithm (GOA) technique. Finally, the Grad-CAM is employed as an XAI technique to enhance transparency by providing human-understandable insights into their decision-making processes. A broad array of experiments using the LXAIOA-ADPCM technique is performed under the Dementia Prediction dataset. The simulation validation of the LXAIOA-ADPCM technique portrayed a superior accuracy output of 95.71% over existing models.

AB  - Dysregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) play a significant role in cancer development and metastasis. In literature, miRNAs have been used for the survival prediction of different types of cancers using AI. Although AI is useful for diagnosis and prognosis prediction of cancer, however, a major criticism of incorporating it into medical fields is that it is essentially a mechanistically uninterpretable opaque "black box", and hence it may not have the required level of accountability, transparency, and reliability in decisions of cancer diagnosis and prognosis for their adoption in clinical settings. Therefore, there is need to develop intelligent models which may explain their prediction so that they may be reliably used by the clinicians. As dysregulated miRNAs are reported to cause cancer metastasis hence, they can play role in survival of patient. Therefore, there is needed to develop ML based techniques which may automatically indicate specific miRNAs involved in survival of patients. In this research, Machine Learning and Explainable AI (XAI) based models have been developed for survival prediction of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSC) patients using miRNA sequences and clinical datasets. miRNAs dataset contains the data of 485 HNSC patients and clinical dataset contains data of 528 patients. The proposed XAI based model explains its prediction by showing the specific miRNA sequences involved in survival of the patients to demonstrate its reliability to be used by clinicians for therapeutic decisions. In this study, it has been shown that explainable ML can provide explicit knowledge of how models make their predictions, which is necessary for increasing the trust and adoption of innovative ML techniques in oncology and healthcare.

AB  - Recently, the healthcare field has undergone rapid changes owing to the accumulation of health big data and the development of machine learning. Data mining research in the field of healthcare has different characteristics from those of other data analyses, such as the structural complexity of the medical data, requirement for medical expertise, and security of personal medical information. Various methods have been implemented to address these issues, including the machine learning model and cloud platform. However, the machine learning model presents the problem of opaque result interpretation, and the cloud platform requires more in-depth research on security and efficiency. To address these issues, this paper presents a recent technology for Internet-of-Things-based (IoT-based) health big data processing. We present a cloud-based IoT health platform and health big data processing technology that reduces the medical data management costs and enhances safety. We also present a data mining technology for health-risk prediction, which is the core of healthcare. Finally, we propose a study using explainable artificial intelligence that enhances the reliability and transparency of the decision-making system, which is called the black box model owing to its lack of transparency.

AB  - The lack of interpretability in artificial intelligence models (i.e., deep learning, machine learning, and rules-based) is an obstacle to their widespread adoption in the healthcare domain. The absence of understandability and transparency frequently leads to (i) inadequate accountability and (ii) a consequent reduction in the quality of the predictive results of the models. On the other hand, the existence of interpretability in the predictions of AI models will facilitate the understanding and trust of the clinicians in these complex models. The data protection regulations worldwide emphasize the relevance of the plausibility and verifiability of AI models' predictions. In response and to take a role in tackling this challenge, we designed the interpretability-based model with algorithms that achieve human-like reasoning abilities through statistical analysis of the datasets by calculating the relative weights of the variables of the features from the medical images and the patient symptoms. The relative weights represented the importance of the variables in predictive decision-making. In addition, the relative weights were used to find the positive and negative probabilities of having the disease, which indicated high fidelity explanations. Hence, the primary goal of our model is to shed light and give insights into the prediction process of the models, as well as to explain how the model predictions have resulted. Consequently, our model contributes by demonstrating accuracy. Furthermore, two experiments on COVID-19 datasets demonstrated the effectiveness and interpretability of the new model.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI)-based clinical decision support systems are gaining momentum by relying on a greater volume and variety of secondary use data. However, the uncertainty, variability, and biases in real -world data environments still pose significant challenges to the development of health AI, its routine clinical use, and its regulatory frameworks. Health AI should be resilient against real -world environments throughout its lifecycle, including the training and prediction phases and maintenance during production, and health AI regulations should evolve accordingly. Data quality issues, variability over time or across sites, information uncertainty, human -computer interaction, and fundamental rights assurance are among the most relevant challenges. If health AI is not designed resiliently with regard to these real -world data effects, potentially biased data -driven medical decisions can risk the safety and fundamental rights of millions of people. In this viewpoint, we review the challenges, requirements, and methods for resilient AI in health and provide a research framework to improve the trustworthiness of next -generation AI -based clinical decision support.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare, notably in ophthalmology, where its ability to interpret images and data can significantly enhance disease diagnosis and patient care. Recent developments in oculomics, the integration of ophthalmic features to develop biomarkers for systemic diseases, have demonstrated the potential for providing rapid, non-invasive methods of screening leading to enhance in early detection and improve healthcare quality, particularly in underserved areas. However, the widespread adoption of such AI-based technologies faces challenges primarily related to the trustworthiness of the system. We demonstrate the potential and considerations needed to develop trustworthy AI in oculomics through a pilot study for HbA1c assessment using an AI-based approach. We then discuss various challenges, considerations, and solutions that have been developed for powerful AI technologies in the past in healthcare and subsequently apply these considerations to the oculomics pilot study. Building upon the observations in the study we highlight the challenges and opportunities for advancing trustworthy AI in oculomics. Ultimately, oculomics presents as a powerful and emerging technology in ophthalmology and understanding how to optimize transparency prior to clinical adoption is of utmost importance.

AB  - BackgroundMonkeypox, a viral zoonotic disease, is an emerging global health concern, with rising incidence and outbreaks extending beyond its endemic regions in Central and, West Africa and the world. The disease transmits through contact with infected animals and humans, leading to fever, rash, and lymphadenopathy symptoms. Control efforts include surveillance, contact tracing, and vaccination campaigns; however, the increasing number of cases underscores the necessity for a coordinated global response to mitigate its impact. Since monkeypox has become a public health issue, new methods for efficiently identifying cases are required. The control of monkeypox infections depends on early detection and prediction. This study aimed to utilize Symptom-Based Detection of Monkeypox using a machine-learning approach.MethodsThis research presents a machine learning approach that integrates various Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to enhance the detection of monkeypox cases based on clinical symptoms, addressing the limitations of image-based diagnostic systems. In this study, we used a publicly available dataset from GitHub containing clinical features about monkeypox disease. The data have been analysed using Random Forest, Bagging, Gradient Boosting, CatBoost, XGBoost, and LGBMClassifier to develop a robust predictive model.ResultsThe study shows that machine learning models can accurately diagnose monkeypox based on symptoms like fever, rash, lymphadenopathy and other clinical symptoms. By using XAI techniques for feature importance, the approach not only achieved high accuracy but also provided transparency in decision-making. This integration of explainable Artificial intelligence (AI) enhances trust and allows healthcare professionals to understand predictions, leading to timely interventions and improved public health responses to monkeypox outbreaks. All Machine learning methods have been compared with the evaluation matrix. The best performance was for the LGBMClassifier, with an accuracy of 89.3%. In addition, multiple Explainable Techniques tools were used to help in examining and explaining the output of the LGBMClassifier model.ConclusionsOur research shows that combining explainable techniques with AI models greatly enhances the accuracy of case detection and boosts the trust of medical professionals. These models result in directly involving the reader and health care professional in the decision-making process, making informed decisions, and efficiently allocating resources by providing insight into the decision-making process. In addition, this study underscores the potential of AI in public health surveillance, particularly in enhancing responses to emerging infectious diseases such as monkeypox.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping healthcare through advancements in clinical decision support and diagnostic capabilities. While human expertise remains foundational to medical practice, AI-powered tools are increasingly matching or exceeding specialist-level performance across multiple domains, paving the way for a new era of democratized healthcare access. These systems promise to reduce disparities in care delivery across demographic, racial, and socioeconomic boundaries by providing high-quality diagnostic support at scale. As a result, advanced healthcare services can be affordable to all populations, irrespective of demographics, race, or socioeconomic background. The democratization of such AI tools can reduce the cost of care, optimize resource allocation, and improve the quality of care. In contrast to humans, AI can potentially uncover complex relationships in the data from a large set of inputs and generate new evidence-based knowledge in medicine. However, integrating AI into healthcare raises several ethical and philosophical concerns, such as bias, transparency, autonomy, responsibility, and accountability. In this study, we examine recent advances in AI-enabled medical image analysis, current regulatory frameworks, and emerging best practices for clinical integration. We analyze both technical and ethical challenges inherent in deploying AI systems across healthcare institutions, with particular attention to data privacy, algorithmic fairness, and system transparency. Furthermore, we propose practical solutions to address key challenges, including data scarcity, racial bias in training datasets, limited model interpretability, and systematic algorithmic biases. Finally, we outline a conceptual algorithm for responsible AI implementations and identify promising future research and development directions.

AB  - The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), has produced high-performance models widely used in various applications, ranging from image recognition and chatbots to autonomous driving and smart grid systems. However, security threats arise from the vulnerabilities of ML models to adversarial attacks and data poisoning, posing risks such as system malfunctions and decision errors. Meanwhile, data privacy concerns arise, especially with personal data being used in model training, which can lead to data breaches. This paper surveys the Adversarial Machine Learning (AML) landscape in modern AI systems, while focusing on the dual aspects of robustness and privacy. Initially, we explore adversarial attacks and defenses using comprehensive taxonomies. Subsequently, we investigate robustness benchmarks alongside open-source AML technologies and software tools that ML system stakeholders can use to develop robust AI systems. Lastly, we delve into the landscape of AML in four industry fields -automotive, digital healthcare, electrical power and energy systems (EPES), and Large Language Model (LLM)-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems- analyzing attacks, defenses, and evaluation concepts, thereby offering a holistic view of the modern AI-reliant industry and promoting enhanced ML robustness and privacy preservation in the future.

AB  - Federated Learning (FL), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) are the most trending and exciting technology in the intelligent healthcare field. Traditionally, the healthcare system works based on centralized agents sharing their raw data. Therefore, huge vulnerabilities and challenges are still existing in this system. However, integrating with AI, the system would be multiple agent collaborators who are capable of communicating with their desired host efficiently. Again, FL is another interesting feature, which works decentralized manner; it maintains the communication based on a model in the preferred system without transferring the raw data. The combination of FL, AI, and XAI techniques can be capable of minimizing several limitations and challenges in the healthcare system. This paper presents a complete analysis of FL using AI for smart healthcare applications. Initially, we discuss contemporary concepts of emerging technologies such as FL, AI, XAI, and the healthcare system. We integrate and classify the FL-AI with healthcare technologies in different domains. Further, we address the existing problems, including security, privacy, stability, and reliability in the healthcare field. In addition, we guide the readers to solving strategies of healthcare using FL and AI. Finally, we address extensive research areas as well as future potential prospects regarding FL-based AI research in the healthcare management system.

AB  - NAS can find better solutions by exploring the vast search space for possible architectures and is widely used in medical AI. However, due to its black-box nature, explainability is important for NAS-assisted medical AI applications. In this paper, we design and implement a risk prediction model for amyloidosis (a rare hematological disease) using an evolutionary neural architecture search (ENAS) to automatically find the best model architecture. To improve the professional acceptance of this prediction model among clinicians, we introduce the concept of result interpretability. Meanwhile, we propose a framework for medical AI systems that can interpret results, utilizing a large language model. The realization of the system provides a more feasible way to apply AI-assisted medical diagnosis on a large scale.

AB  - Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive method employed to discern human behaviors by monitoring the neurological responses during cognitive and motor tasks. Machine learning (ML) represents a promising tool for the recognition of human activities (HAR), and eXplainable artificial intelligence (XAI) can elucidate the role of EEG features in ML-based HAR models. The primary objective of this investigation is to investigate the feasibility of an EEG-based ML model for categorizing everyday activities, such as resting, motor, and cognitive tasks, and interpreting models clinically through XAI techniques to explicate the EEG features that contribute the most to different HAR states. The study involved an examination of 75 healthy individuals with no prior diagnosis of neurological disorders. EEG recordings were obtained during the resting state, as well as two motor control states (walking and working tasks), and a cognition state (reading task). Electrodes were placed in specific regions of the brain, including the frontal, central, temporal, and occipital lobes (Fz, C1, C2, T7, T8, Oz). Several ML models were trained using EEG data for activity recognition and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) was employed for interpreting clinically the most influential EEG spectral features in HAR models. The classification results of the HAR models, particularly the Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models, demonstrated outstanding performances in distinguishing the analyzed human activities. The ML models exhibited alignment with EEG spectral bands in the recognition of human activity, a finding supported by the XAI explanations. To sum up, incorporating eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) into Human Activity Recognition (HAR) studies may improve activity monitoring for patient recovery, motor imagery, the healthcare metaverse, and clinical virtual reality settings.

AB  - The rapid increase in the use of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has transformed everyday life and industries such as healthcare, transportation, and smart homes. However, these devices, often limited in resources, depend on communication across edge, fog, and cloud layers, creating vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit. This paper provides a comprehensive review of intelligent intrusion detection system (IDS) tailored for IoT security, focusing on solutions that utilize Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL). We analyze existing IDS approaches for IoT devices and secure communication across the edge, fog, and cloud layers, highlighting their strengths and limitations. Additionally, we identify Key research challenges include computational complexity, real-time adaptability, and energy efficiency in Edge Computing. To address these gaps, we propose future research directions, including neuromorphic computing for ultra-fast IDS, self-evolving AI-driven IDS, hyper-personalized anomaly detection, federated learning for privacy- preserving security, and explainable AI (XAI) for human-AI collaboration. By integrating these innovations, we envision next-generation IDS solutions that offer scalable, interpretable, and energy- efficient security frameworks for the dynamic IoT ecosystem.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is used in healthcare to monitor patients via wearable sensors to measure different physiological parameters. Smart healthcare IoT-enabled sensors and medical device data collaborate with other smart devices to transfer collected sensitive healthcare data to the central server in a secure manner. However, this collected data suffers from noise, imbalance, privacy concerns, and challenges in real-time analysis. Thus, this work is to develop a novel IoT and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) based data aggregation framework in smart healthcare systems to enable accurate patient health status and decision-making in real-time. Initially, body-integrated wearable sensors and devices collect physiological data, forming a comprehensive dataset. After that, this data is preprocessed and encrypted using Fully Homomorphic Encryption for secure transmission to the centralized servers. Meaningful features are extracted from the preprocessed data using Autoencoders, which perform effective dimensionality reduction while preserving critical information. Finally, Tabular Network (TabNet) classifies health status and risks with high precision. TabNet is a deep learning model specifically designed for structured data, which efficiently handles tabular data using attention mechanisms for feature selection and decision-making. The framework integrates XAI methods to provide interpretable predictions and actionable insights, ensuring transparency for healthcare providers. As a result, TabNet demonstrates a remarkable accuracy rate of 99.57 %, making it possible for doctors to provide consultations at any time, thereby improving the efficiency of traditional medical systems.

AB  - Brain tumor, a leading cause of uncontrolled cell growth in the central nervous system, presents substantial challenges in medical diagnosis and treatment. Early and accurate detection is essential for effective intervention. This study aims to enhance the detection and classification of brain tumors in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans using an innovative framework combining Vision Transformer (ViT) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) models. We utilized primary MRI data from Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical College Hospital (BSMMCH) in Faridpur, Bangladesh. Our hybrid ViT-GRU model extracts essential features via ViT and identifies relationships between these features using GRU, addressing class imbalance and outperforming existing diagnostic methods. We extensively processed the dataset, and then trained the model using various optimizers (SGD, Adam, AdamW) and evaluated through rigorous 10-fold cross-validation. Additionally, we incorporated Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques-Attention Map, SHAP, and LIME-to enhance the interpretability of the model's predictions. For the primary dataset BrTMHD-2023, the ViT-GRU model achieved precision, recall, and F1-score metrics of 97%. The highest accuracies obtained with SGD, Adam, and AdamW optimizers were 81.66%, 96.56%, and 98.97%, respectively. Our model outperformed existing Transfer Learning models by 1.26%, as validated through comparative analysis and cross-validation. The proposed model also shows excellent performances with another Brain Tumor Kaggle Dataset outperforming the existing research done on the same dataset with 96.08% accuracy. The proposed ViT-GRU framework significantly improves the detection and classification of brain tumors in MRI scans. The integration of XAI techniques enhances the model's transparency and reliability, fostering trust among clinicians and facilitating clinical application. Future work will expand the dataset and apply findings to real-time diagnostic devices, advancing the field.

AB  - A comprehensive system for automated medical data analysis and diagnosis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease using artificial intelligence has been developed. The system consists of several modules: medical data aggregation, AI model training using advanced machine learning algorithms, Explainable AI generating reports, and patient diagnosis by ensemble model. Those models have achieved diagnostic accuracy higher than 95%, and the system is designed for continuous improvement by aggregating more data and automatically retraining models. It is a modern, flexible, and scalable tool designed to support medical diagnosis. It can make doctors' work easier and faster, and the discovered biomarkers of a disease can increase the quality of its diagnosis. The ensemble model generating diagnoses achieved nearly perfect quality and, using explainable artificial intelligence, it was possible to determine attributes and their values that constitute non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease (NAFLD) biomarkers.

AB  - Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of cancer that occurs in many organs of the human body. To detect carcinoma, pathologists observe tissue samples at multiple magnifications, which is time-consuming and prone to inter- or intra-observer variability. The key challenge for automation of squamous cell carcinoma diagnosis is to extract the features at low (100x) magnification and explain the decision -making process to healthcare professionals. The existing literature used either machine learning or deep learning models to detect squamous cell carcinoma of specific organs. In this work, we report on the implementation of an explainable diagnostic aid system for squamous cell carcinoma of any organ and present a comparative analysis with state-of-the-art models. A classifier with an ensemble feature selection technique is developed to provide an automatic diagnostic aid for distinguishing between squamous cell carcinoma positive and negative cases based on histopathological images. Moreover, explainable AI techniques such as ELI5, LIME and SHAP are introduced to machine learning model which provides feature interpretability of prediction made by the classifier. The results show that the machine learning model achieved an accuracy of 93.43% and 96.66% on public and multi -centric private datasets, respectively. The proposed CatBoost classifier achieved remarkable performance in diagnosing multi -organ squamous cell carcinoma from low magnification histopathological images, even when various illumination variations were introduced.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) systems have demonstrated impressive performance across a variety of clinical tasks. However, notoriously, sometimes these systems are "black boxes. " The initial response in the literature was a demand for "explainable AI. " However, recently, several authors have suggested that making AI more explainable or "interpretable " is likely to be at the cost of the accuracy of these systems and that prioritizing interpretability in medical AI may constitute a "lethal prejudice. " In this paper, we defend the value of interpretability in the context of the use of AI in medicine. Clinicians may prefer interpretable systems over more accurate black boxes, which in turn is sufficient to give designers of AI reason to prefer more interpretable systems in order to ensure that AI is adopted and its benefits realized. Moreover, clinicians may be justified in this preference. Achieving the downstream benefits from AI is critically dependent on how the outputs of these systems are interpreted by physicians and patients. A preference for the use of highly accurate black box AI systems, over less accurate but more interpretable systems, may itself constitute a form of lethal prejudice that may diminish the benefits of AI to-and perhaps even harm-patients.

AB  - A crucial challenge in critical settings like medical diagnosis is making deep learning models used in decision-making systems interpretable. Efforts in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) are underway to address this challenge. Yet, many XAI methods are evaluated on broad classifiers and fail to address complex, real-world issues, such as medical diagnosis. In our study, we focus on enhancing user trust and confidence in automated AI decision-making systems, particularly for diagnosing skin lesions, by tailoring an XAI method to explain an AI model's ability to identify various skin lesion types. We generate explanations using synthetic images of skin lesions as examples and counterexamples, offering a method for practitioners to pinpoint the critical features influencing the classification outcome. A validation survey involving domain experts, novices, and laypersons has demonstrated that explanations increase trust and confidence in the automated decision system. Furthermore, our exploration of the model's latent space reveals clear separations among the most common skin lesion classes, a distinction that likely arises from the unique characteristics of each class and could assist in correcting frequent misdiagnoses by human professionals.

AB  - Breast cancer represents a significant health concern, particularly in Saudi Arabia, where it ranks as the most prevalent cancer type among women. This study focuses on leveraging eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to predict benign and malignant breast cancer cases using various clinical and pathological features specific to Saudi Arabian patients. Six distinct models were trained and evaluated based on common performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC score. To enhance interpretability, Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were applied. The analysis identified the Random Forest model as the top performer, achieving an accuracy of 0.72, along with robust precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC score values. Conversely, the Support Vector Machine model exhibited the poorest performance metrics, indicating its limited predictive capability. Notably, the XAI approaches unveiled variations in the feature importance rankings across models, underscoring the need for further investigation. These findings offer valuable insights into breast cancer diagnosis and machine learning interpretation, aiding healthcare providers in understanding and potentially integrating such technologies into clinical practices.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) based cyber threat detection tools are widely used to process and analyze a large amount of data for improved intrusion detection performance. However, these models are often considered as black box by the cybersecurity experts due to their inability to comprehend or interpret the reasoning behind the decisions. Moreover, AI-based threat hunting is data-driven and is usually modeled using the data provided by multiple cloud vendors. This is another critical challenge, as a malicious cloud can provide false information (i.e., insider attacks) and can degrade the threat-hunting capability. In this paper, we present a blockchain-enabled eXplainable AI (XAI) for enhancing the decision-making capability of cyber threat detection in the context of Smart Healthcare Systems. Specifically, first, we use blockchain to validate and store data between multiple cloud vendors by implementing a Clique Proof-of-Authority (C-PoA) consensus. Second, a novel deep learning-based threat-hunting model is built by combining Parallel Stacked Long Short Term Memory (PSLSTM) networks with a multi-head attention mechanism for improved attack detection. The extensive experiment confirms its potential to be used as an enhanced decision support system by cybersecurity analysts.

AB  - Understanding the decisions taken by machine learning systems is instrumental in their deployment in real -world systems, as it enables responsible decision -making, fosters trust, and facilitates debugging and improvement. The research field devoted to studying the techniques that explain and illustrate those decisions is called explainable AI. Fuzzy logic, with its interpretable fuzzy rule -based inference, has emerged as a popular tool for Explainable AI because of these interpretable classifiers. However, current fuzzy logic libraries provide limited inference capabilities and integration to machine learning or are only available in the Java or R language, which makes their integration with the standard machine libraries in Python challenging. This paper describes a software library that contains a Python implementation to perform fuzzy inference using different kinds of fuzzy sets, with a special focus on result visualization. This library follows the scikit-learn programming interface, enabling researchers to utilize it with minimum fuzzy logic background seamlessly. This toolkit unveils novel tools for programming fuzzy systems that are learnable using machine learning methods, leading to data -powered systems that maintain full transparency and accountability, accessible to virtually anyone without specialized AI training. The interpretability of these systems makes them highly valuable in industries like healthcare, law, and security.

AB  - Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is currently experiencing a growing worldwide incidence and can lead to premature mortality if diagnosed late, resulting in rising costs to healthcare systems. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) offer the possibility of an early diagnosis of CKD that could revert further kidney damage. However, clinicians may be hesitant to adopt AI models if the reasoning behind the predictions is not understandable. Since eXplainable AI (XAI) addresses the clinicians' requirement of understanding AI models' output, this work presents the development and evaluation of an explainable CKD prediction model that provides information about how different patient's clinical features contribute to CKD early diagnosis. The model was developed using an optimization framework that balances classification accuracy and explainability. The main contribution of the paper lies in an explainable data-driven approach to offer quantitative information about the contribution of certain clinical features in the early diagnosis of CKD. As a result, the optimal explainable prediction model implements an extreme gradient boosting classifier using 3 features (hemoglobin, specific gravity, and hypertension) with an accuracy of 99.2% (standard deviation 0.8) and 97.5% with a 5-fold cross-validation and with new unseen data respectively. In addition, an explainability analysis shows that hemoglobin is the most relevant feature that influences the prediction, followed by specific gravity and hypertension. This small number of features selected results in a reduced cost of the early diagnosis of CKD implying a promising solution for developing countries.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based systems have been proposed to aid Mental Health Professionals (MHPs) in various tasks, including the prevention of suicide by identifying Suicidal Ideation (SI). However, these systems may lack transparency and thereby create mistrust among MHPs. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods can elucidate how features influence system predictions, aiding MHPs in understanding them. This exploratory study aims to investigate how MHPs' trust is influenced by AI explanations (educational intervention and XAI methods) and other factors (professional background, knowledge of AI and computing, and reported system misclassification). We conducted an experiment using Boamente, an AI-powered clinical decision support system designed to assist MHPs in suicide prevention. Boamente identifies SI in Brazilian Portuguese texts typed on smartphones by leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) for analysis. The results demonstrate that professional background, knowledge of AI and computing, and educational intervention had no statistically significant effect on trust. In contrast, trust was affected by factors such as LLM prediction explanations, the quality of explanations, and reported misclassification. Therefore, providing prediction explanations to understand the inner workings of AI models led MHPs to be more critical in relation to predictions, while there was an overtrust on MHPs when no explanations were provided. Furthermore, disagreement with LLM classifications and perceptions of system vulnerabilities also affected trust.

AB  - This survey paper explores the transformative role of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR), marking a paradigm shift from conventional, manually driven resuscitation practices to intelligent, data-driven interventions. It examines the evolution of CPR through the lens of predictive modeling, AI-enhanced devices, and real-time decision-making tools that collectively aim to improve resuscitation outcomes and survival rates. Unlike prior surveys that either focus solely on traditional CPR methods or offer general insights into ML applications in healthcare, this work provides a novel interdisciplinary synthesis tailored specifically to the domain of CPR. It presents a comprehensive taxonomy that classifies ML techniques into four key CPR-related tasks: rhythm analysis, outcome prediction, non-invasive blood pressure and chest compression modeling, and real-time detection of pulse and Return of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC). The paper critically evaluates emerging ML approaches-including Reinforcement Learning (RL) and transformer-based models-while also addressing real-world implementation barriers such as model interpretability, data limitations, and deployment in high-stakes clinical settings. Furthermore, it highlights the role of eXplainable AI (XAI) in fostering clinical trust and adoption. By bridging the gap between resuscitation science and advanced ML techniques, this survey establishes a structured foundation for future research and practical innovation in ML-enhanced CPR. It offers clear insights, identifies unexplored opportunities, and sets a forward-looking research agenda identifying emerging trends and practical implementation challenges aiming to improve both the reliability and effectiveness of CPR in real-world emergencies.

AB  - Ensemble Learning (EL) has been used for almost ten years to classify heart diseases, but it is still difficult to grasp how the "black boxes", or non-interpretable models, behave inside. Predicting heart disease is crucial to healthcare, since it allows for prompt diagnosis and treatment of the patient's true state. Nonetheless, it is still difficult to forecast illness with any degree of accuracy. In this study, we have suggested a framework for the prediction of heart disease based on Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)-based hybrid Ensemble Learning (EL) models, such as LightBoost and XGBoost algorithms. The main goals are to build predictive models and apply SHAP (SHapley Additive expPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) analysis to improve the interpretability of the models. We carefully construct our systems and test different hybrid ensemble learning algorithms to determine which model is best for heart disease prediction (HDP). The approach promotes interpretability and transparency when examining these widespread health issues. By combining hybrid Ensemble learning models with XAI, the important factors and risk signals that underpin the co-occurrence of heart disease are made visible. The accuracy, precision, and recall of such models were used to evaluate their efficacy. This study highlights how crucial it is for healthcare models to be transparent and recommends the inclusion of XAI to improve interpretability and medical decisionmaking.

AB  - Background: This study aims to assess the efficacy of combining automated machine learning (AutoML) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) in identifying metabolomic biomarkers that can differentiate between hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver cirrhosis in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Methods: We investigated publicly accessible data encompassing HCC patients and cirrhotic controls. The TPOT tool, which is an AutoML tool, was used to optimize the preparation of features and data, as well as to select the most suitable machine learning model. The TreeSHAP approach, which is a type of XAI, was used to interpret the model by assessing each metabolite's individual contribution to the categorization process. Results: TPOT had superior performance in distinguishing between HCC and cirrhosis compared to other AutoML approaches AutoSKlearn and H2O AutoML, in addition to traditional machine learning models such as random forest, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbor. The TPOT technique attained an AUC value of 0.81, showcasing superior accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in comparison to the other models. Key metabolites, including L-valine, glycine, and DL-isoleucine, were identified as essential by TPOT and subsequently verified by TreeSHAP analysis. TreeSHAP provided a comprehensive explanation of the contribution of these metabolites to the model's predictions, thereby increasing the interpretability and dependability of the results. This thorough assessment highlights the strength and reliability of the AutoML framework in the development of clinical biomarkers. Conclusions: This study shows that AutoML and XAI can be used together to create metabolomic biomarkers that are specific to HCC. The exceptional performance of TPOT in comparison to traditional models highlights its capacity to identify biomarkers. Furthermore, TreeSHAP boosted model transparency by highlighting the relevance of certain metabolites. This comprehensive method has the potential to enhance the identification of biomarkers and generate precise, easily understandable, AI-driven solutions for diagnosing HCC.

AB  - Deep learning offers significant advancements in the accuracy of prostate identification and classification, underscoring its potential for clinical integration. However, the opacity of deep learning models presents interpretability challenges, critical for their acceptance and utility in medical diagnosis and detection. While explanation methods have been proposed to demystify these models, enhancing their clinical viability, the efficacy and acceptance of these methods in medical tasks are not well documented. This pilot study investigates the effectiveness of deep learning explanation methods in clinical settings and identifies the attributes that radiologists consider crucial for explainability, aiming to direct future enhancements. This study reveals that while explanation methods can improve clinical task performance by up to 20%, their perceived usefulness varies, with some methods being rated poorly. Radiologists prefer explanation methods that are robust against noise, precise, and consistent. These preferences underscore the need for refining explanation methods to align with clinical expectations, emphasizing clarity, accuracy, and reliability. The findings highlight the importance of developing explanation methods that not only improve performance but also are tailored to meet the stringent requirements of clinical practice, thereby facilitating deeper trust and a broader acceptance of deep learning in medical diagnostics.

AB  - Coronary heart disease is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Although no cure exists for this condition, appropriate treatment and timely intervention can effectively manage its symptoms and reduce the risk of complications such as heart attacks. Prior studies have mostly relied on a limited dataset from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, predominantly focusing on Machine Learning (ML) models without incorporating Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) or Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) techniques for dataset enhancement. While some research has explored cloud-based deployments, the implementation of edge AI in this domain remains largely under-explored. Therefore, this paper proposes HealthEdgeAI, a sustainable approach to heart disease prediction that enhances XAI through GAI-driven data augmentation. In our research, we assessed multiple AI models by evaluating accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the curve (AUC). We also developed a web application using Streamlit to demonstrate our XAI methods and employed FastAPI to serve the optimal model as an API. Additionally, we examined the performance of these models in cloud computing and edge AI settings by comparing key Quality of Service (QoS) parameters, such as average response rate and throughput. To highlight the potential of sustainable edge AI and cloud computing, we tested edge devices with both low- and high-end configurations to illustrate differences in QoS. Ultimately, this study identifies current limitations and outlines prospective directions for future research in AI-based cloud and edge computing environments.

AB  - Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is critical for validating and trusting the decisions made by Machine Learning (ML) models, especially in high-stakes domains such as healthcare and finance. However, existing XAI methods often face significant computational challenges. To address this gap, this paper introduces a novel Perturbation-Based Explanation (PeBEx) method and comprehensively evaluates it versus local interpretable model-agnostic explanation approach (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) across multiple datasets and ML models to assess explanation quality and computational efficiency. PeBEx leverages perturbation-based strategies to systematically alter input features and observe changes in model predictions to determine feature importance. This method not only offers superior computational efficiency, leading to scalability and efficiency for complex models on large datasets. Through testing on both synthetic and public datasets using eight ML models, we uncover the relative strengths and limitations of each XAI method in terms of explanation accuracy, fidelity, and computational demands. Our results show that while SHAP and LIME provide detailed explanations, they often suffer from high computational costs, particularly with complex models like Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Conversely, PeBEx demonstrates superior efficiency and scalability, making it particularly suitable for applications that require rapid response times without compromising explanation quality. We conclude by proposing potential enhancements for PeBEx, including its adoption in a wider array of large-scale models. This study not only advances our understanding of the computational aspects of XAI but also proposes PeBEx as a viable solution for improving the efficiency, scalability, and applicability of explainability in ML.

AB  - Machine learning (ML) has been applied to predict the efficacy of biologic agents in ulcerative colitis (UC). ML can offer precision, personalization, efficiency, and automation. Moreover, it can improve decision support in predicting clinical outcomes. However, it faces challenges related to data quality and quantity, overfitting, generalization, and interpretability. This paper comments on two recent ML models that predict the efficacy of vedolizumab and ustekinumab in UC. Models that consider multiple pathways, multiple ethnicities, and combinations of real-world and clinical trial data are required for optimal shared decision-making and precision medicine. This paper also highlights the potential of combining ML with computational models to enhance clinical outcomes and personalized healthcare. Key Insights: (1) ML offers precision, personalization, efficiency, and decision support for predicting the efficacy of biologic agents in UC. (2) Challenging aspects in ML prediction include data quality, overfitting, and interpretability. (3) Multiple pathways, multiple ethnicities, and combinations of real-world and clinical trial data should be considered in predictive models for optimal decision-making. (4) Combining ML with computational models may improve clinical outcomes and personalized healthcare.

AB  - Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), also known as Motor Neuron Disease (MND), is a rare and fatal neurodegenerative disease. As ALS is currently incurable, the aim of the treatment is mainly to alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life (QoL). We designed a prototype Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) to alert clinicians when a person with ALS is experiencing low QoL in order to inform and personalise the support they receive. Explainability is important for the success of a CDSS and its acceptance by healthcare professionals. The aim of this work isto announce our prototype (C-ALS), supported by a first short evaluation of its explainability. Given the lack of similar studies and systems, this work is a valid proof-of-concept that will lead to future work. We developed a CDSS that was evaluated by members of the team of healthcare professionals that provide care to people with ALS in the ALS/MND Multidisciplinary Clinic in Dublin, Ireland. We conducted a user study where participants were asked to review the CDSS and complete a short survey with a focus on explainability. Healthcare professionals demonstrated some uncertainty in understanding the system's output. Based on their feedback, we altered the explanation provided in the updated version of our CDSS. C-ALS provides local explanations of its predictions in a post-hoc manner, using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). The CDSS predicts the risk of low QoL in the form of a probability, a bar plot shows the feature importance for the specific prediction, along with some verbal guidelines on how to interpret the results. Additionally, we provide the option of a global explanation of the system's function in the form of a bar plot showing the average importance of each feature. C-ALS is available online for academic use.

AB  - In recent years, we have witnessed both artificial intelligence obtaining remarkable results in clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) improving the interpretability of these models. In turn, this fosters the adoption by medical personnel and improves trustworthiness of CDSSs. Among others, counterfactual explanations prove to be one such XAI technique particularly suitable for the healthcare domain due to its ease of interpretation, even for less technically proficient staff. However, the generation of high-quality counterfactuals relies on generative models for guidance. Unfortunately, training such models requires a huge amount of data that is beyond the means of ordinary hospitals. In this paper, we therefore propose to use federated learning to allow multiple hospitals to jointly train such generative models while maintaining full data privacy. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to locally generated counterfactuals. Moreover, we prove that generative models for counterfactual generation that are trained using federated learning in a suitable environment perform only marginally worse compared to centrally trained ones while offering the benefit of data privacy preservation. Finally, we integrate our method into a prototypical CDSS for treatment recommendation for sepsis patients, thus providing a proof of concept for real-world application as well as insights and sanity checks from clinical application.

AB  - This study introduces a machine learning (ML)-based platform aimed at predicting the effectiveness of Metacognitive Training (MCT). The platform is meant to function as an experimental prototype in the scope of a clinical research project for a decision support system to assist clinicians in tailoring treatment plans for patients with psychosis. It integrates eight ML models to evaluate MCT effectiveness under a wide range of mental health questionnaires to assess a broad spectrum of psychological symptoms. By incorporating diverse measures, the platform aims to capture a comprehensive understanding of patient profiles, enabling more precise and tailored predictions for treatment personalization. Furthermore, the transparency requirements for artificial intelligence (AI) systems, as outlined in the AI Act regulation of the European Union, are addressed through the implementation of explainable AI models, using post-hoc explanations based on SHAP analysis for each predictive model. Ethical concerns related to ensuring gender-neutral behavior in the system are tackled by conducting a disparate impact analysis, which evaluates biases present in the models enhancing the system's accountability and alignment with ethical and regulatory standards.

AB  - Mental illnesses are becoming increasingly prevalent, in turn leading to an increased interest in exploring artificial intelligence (AI) solutions to facilitate and enhance healthcare processes ranging from diagnosis to monitoring and treatment. In contrast to application areas where black box systems may be acceptable, explainability in healthcare applications is essential, especially in the case of diagnosing complex and sensitive mental health issues. In this paper, we first summarize recent developments in AI research for mental health, followed by an overview of approaches to explainable AI and their potential benefits in healthcare settings. We then present a recent case study of applying explainable AI for ADHD diagnosis which is used as a basis to identify challenges in realizing explainable AI solutions for mental health diagnosis and potential future research directions to address these challenges.

AB  - Social anxiety disorder (SAD), also known as social phobia, is a psychological condition in which a person has a persistent and overwhelming fear of being negatively judged or observed by other individuals. This fear can affect them at work, in relationships and other social activities. The intricate combination of several environmental and biological factors is the reason for the onset of this mental condition. SAD is diagnosed using a test called the "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders (DSM-5), which is based on several physical, emotional and demographic symptoms. Artificial Intelligence has been a boon for medicine and is regularly used to diagnose various health conditions and diseases. Hence, this study used demographic, emotional, and physical symptoms and multiple machine learning (ML) techniques to diagnose SAD. A thorough descriptive and statistical analysis has been conducted before using the classifiers. Among all the models, the AdaBoost and logistic regression obtained the highest accuracy of 88 % each. Four eXplainable artificial techniques (XAI) techniques are utilized to make the predictions interpretable, transparent and understandable. According to XAI, the "Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale questionnaire" and "The fear of speaking in public" are the most critical attributes in the diagnosis of SAD. This clinical decision support system framework could be utilized in various suitable locations such as schools, hospitals and workplaces to identify SAD in people.

T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS

KW  - CT
AB  - Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have sparked interest in developing explainable AI (XAI) methods for clinical decision support systems, especially in translational research. Although using XAI methods may enhance trust in black-box models, evaluating their effectiveness has been challenging, primarily due to the absence of human (expert) intervention, additional annotations, and automated strategies. In order to conduct a thorough assessment, we propose a patch perturbation-based approach to automatically evaluate the quality of explanations in medical imaging analysis. To eliminate the need for human efforts in conventional evaluation methods, our approach executes poisoning attacks during model retraining by generating both static and dynamic triggers. We then propose a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics during the model inference stage to facilitate the evaluation from multiple perspectives, covering a wide range of correctness, completeness, consistency, and complexity. In addition, we include an extensive case study to showcase the proposed evaluation strategy by applying widely-used XAI methods on COVID-19 X-ray imaging classification tasks, as well as a thorough review of existing XAI methods in medical imaging analysis with evaluation availability. The proposed patch perturbation-based workflow offers model developers an automated and generalizable evaluation strategy to identify potential pitfalls and optimize their proposed explainable solutions, while also aiding end-users in comparing and selecting appropriate XAI methods that meet specific clinical needs in real-world clinical research and practice.

AB  - Background Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a type of tumor caused by the uncontrolled growth of cells in the mucosa lining the last part of the intestine. Emerging evidence underscores an association between CRC and gut microbiome dysbiosis. The high mortality rate of this cancer has made it necessary to develop new early diagnostic methods. Machine learning (ML) techniques can represent a solution to evaluate the interaction between intestinal microbiota and host physiology. Through explained artificial intelligence (XAI) it is possible to evaluate the individual contributions of microbial taxonomic markers for each subject. Our work also implements the Shapley Method Additive Explanations (SHAP) algorithm to identify for each subject which parameters are important in the context of CRC.Results The proposed study aimed to implement an explainable artificial intelligence framework using both gut microbiota data and demographic information from subjects to classify a cohort of control subjects from those with CRC. Our analysis revealed an association between gut microbiota and this disease. We compared three machine learning algorithms, and the Random Forest (RF) algorithm emerged as the best classifier, with a precision of 0.729 +/- 0.038 and an area under the Precision-Recall curve of 0.668 +/- 0.016. Additionally, SHAP analysis highlighted the most crucial variables in the model's decision-making, facilitating the identification of specific bacteria linked to CRC. Our results confirmed the role of certain bacteria, such as Fusobacterium, Peptostreptococcus, and Parvimonas, whose abundance appears notably associated with the disease, as well as bacteria whose presence is linked to a non-diseased state.Discussion These findings emphasizes the potential of leveraging gut microbiota data within an explainable AI framework for CRC classification. The significant association observed aligns with existing knowledge. The precision exhibited by the RF algorithm reinforces its suitability for such classification tasks. The SHAP analysis not only enhanced interpretability but identified specific bacteria crucial in CRC determination. This approach opens avenues for targeted interventions based on microbial signatures. Further exploration is warranted to deepen our understanding of the intricate interplay between microbiota and health, providing insights for refined diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Background: Diabetes remains a major global health challenge, contributing significantly to premature mortality due to its potential progression to organ failure if not diagnosed early. Traditional diagnostic approaches are subject to human error, highlighting the need for modern computational techniques in clinical decision support systems. Although these systems have successfully integrated deep learning (DL) models, they still encounter several challenges, such as a lack of intricate pattern learning, imbalanced datasets, and poor interpretability of predictions. Methods: To address these issues, the temporal inception perceptron network (TIPNet), a novel DL model, is designed to accurately predict diabetes by capturing complex feature relationships and temporal dynamics. An adaptive synthetic oversampling strategy is utilized to reduce severe class imbalance in an extensive diabetes health indicators dataset consisting of 253,680 instances and 22 features, providing a diverse and representative sample for model evaluation. The model's performance and generalizability are assessed using a 10-fold cross-validation technique. To enhance interpretability, explainable artificial intelligence techniques are integrated, including local interpretable model-agnostic explanations and Shapley additive explanations, providing insights into the model's decision-making process. Results: Experimental results demonstrate that TIPNet achieves improvement scores of 3.53% in accuracy, 3.49% in F1-score, 1.14% in recall, and 5.95% in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Conclusions: These findings indicate that TIPNet is a promising tool for early diabetes prediction, offering accurate and interpretable results. The integration of advanced DL modeling with oversampling strategies and explainable AI techniques positions TIPNet as a valuable resource for clinical decision support, paving the way for its future application in healthcare settings.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are at an increased risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs), highlighting the need for accurate risk prediction and personalized interventions. This study aims to develop and evaluate machine learning (ML) models to identify key predictive features and enhance clinical decision-making in MACE risk assessment. Methods: A dataset comprising 84 variables, including patient demographics, laboratory findings, and comorbidities, was analyzed using CatBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM. Feature selection, cross-validation, and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analyses were employed to improve model interpretability and clinical relevance. Results: CatBoost exhibited the highest predictive performance among the models tested, achieving an AUC of 0.745 (0.605-0.83) with balanced sensitivity and specificity. Key predictors of MACEs included antiplatelet use, the grade of left ventricular hypertrophy, and serum albumin levels. SHAP analysis enhanced the interpretability of model outputs, supporting clinician-led risk stratification. Conclusions: This study highlights the potential of ML-based predictive modeling to improve MACE risk assessment in patients with ESRD. The findings support the adoption of ML models in clinical workflows by integrating explainable AI methods to enable individualized treatment planning. Future integration with electronic health record systems may facilitate real-time decision-making and enhance patient outcomes.

AB  - Breast cancer is characterized by the proliferation of abnormal breast cells that eventually turn into malignant tumors. These cancer cells can metastasize to be life-threatening and fatal. An intricate mix of environmental factors and individual genetic composition can lead to the formation of this deadly carcinoma. Improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer are essential given the rising incidence of breast cancer. Over the past few decades, machine learning has helped provide accurate medical diagnosis results. Therefore, this study used diagnostic characteristics of patients and multiple machine learning classifiers to identify breast cancer. Incorporating explainable artificial intelligence techniques revealed the underlying factors for the model predictions, adding a layer of transparency and interpretability. Out of the algorithms, random forest showed the best result, an F1-score of 84%. The stacked ensemble model, which combines the strengths of different models, obtained an F1-score performance of 83%. The research emphasized the results obtained by explainers such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations), ELI5 (Explain Like I'm Five), Anchor and QLattice (Quantum Lattice) to decipher the findings. Interpretable algorithms can be applied in the medical sector to assist practitioners in predicting breast cancer, reducing diagnostic errors, and improving clinical decision-making.

AB  - Chronic wounds contribute to significant healthcare and economic burden worldwide. Wound assessment remains challenging given its complex and dynamic nature. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning methods in wound analysis is promising. Explainable modelling can help its integration and acceptance in healthcare systems. We aim to develop an explainable AI model for analysing vascular wound images among an Asian population. Two thousand nine hundred and fifty-seven wound images from a vascular wound image registry from a tertiary institution in Singapore were utilized. The dataset was split into training, validation and test sets. Wound images were classified into four types (neuroischaemic ulcer [NIU], surgical site infections [SSI], venous leg ulcers [VLU], pressure ulcer [PU]), measured with automatic estimation of width, length and depth and segmented into 18 wound and peri-wound features. Data pre-processing was performed using oversampling and augmentation techniques. Convolutional and deep learning models were utilized for model development. The model was evaluated with accuracy, F1 score and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Explainability methods were used to interpret AI decision reasoning. A web browser application was developed to demonstrate results of the wound AI model with explainability. After development, the model was tested on additional 15 476 unlabelled images to evaluate effectiveness. After the development on the training and validation dataset, the model performance on unseen labelled images in the test set achieved an AUROC of 0.99 for wound classification with mean accuracy of 95.9%. For wound measurements, the model achieved AUROC of 0.97 with mean accuracy of 85.0% for depth classification, and AUROC of 0.92 with mean accuracy of 87.1% for width and length determination. For wound segmentation, an AUROC of 0.95 and mean accuracy of 87.8% was achieved. Testing on unlabelled images, the model confidence score for wound classification was 82.8% with an explainability score of 60.6%. Confidence score was 87.6% for depth classification with 68.0% explainability score, while width and length measurement obtained 93.0% accuracy score with 76.6% explainability. Confidence score for wound segmentation was 83.9%, while explainability was 72.1%. Using explainable AI models, we have developed an algorithm and application for analysis of vascular wound images from an Asian population with accuracy and explainability. With further development, it can be utilized as a clinical decision support system and integrated into existing healthcare electronic systems.

AB  - Artificial intelligence-based algorithms are widely adopted in critical applications such as healthcare and autonomous vehicles. Mitigating the security and privacy issues of AI models, and enhancing their trustworthiness have become of paramount importance. We present a detailed investigation of existing security, privacy, and defense techniques and strategies to make machine learning more secure and trustworthy. We focus on the new paradigm of machine learning called federated learning, where one aims to develop machine learning models involving different partners (data sources) that do not need to share data and information with each other. In particular, we discuss how federated learning bridges security and privacy, how it guarantees privacy requirements of AI applications, and then highlight challenges that need to be addressed in the future. Finally, after having surveyed the high-level concepts of trustworthy AI and its different components and identifying present research trends addressing security, privacy, and trustworthiness separately, we discuss possible interconnections and dependencies between these three fields. All in all, we provide some insight to explain how AI researchers should focus on building a unified solution combining security, privacy, and trustworthy AI in the future.

AB  - The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in oncology promises to continuously improve cancer treatment and prevention. In addition to improving diagnosis and optimizing therapy, AI is also helping to increase the efficiency of clinical processes. The automation of routine tasks and AI-based decision-support systems facilitate physicians' work by providing relevant information in real time. In addition, AI algorithms are demonstrating impressive capabilities in the precise detection of tumors through the analysis of medical image data and the identification of genetic markers for personalized therapy approaches. A prerequisite for this is the provision of data, which is also a challenge in oncology. The complexity of the different types of data, including medical images, genomic data, and clinical information, requires not only advanced analysis methods, but also the provision of data in a standardized form. In addition, privacy and ethical issues must be addressed and considered when using sensitive patient data. Transparency and interpretability of AI algorithms are critical to building trust in the technology. The combination of AI and oncology signals a paradigm shift towards more precise, personalized, and efficient patient care, while improving quality of life. While the positive impact on diagnostic accuracy and treatment optimization is promising, overcoming the data-related challenges requires continuous collaboration between researchers, physicians, and patients.

AB  - Emotion recognition, a burgeoning field with applications in healthcare, human-computer interaction, and affective computing, has seen significant advances by integrating physiological signals and environmental factors. With the increasing development of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the precision and efficiency of machine learning (ML) algorithms are becoming increasingly crucial to a growing number of businesses. However, the mystery and black-box effect of ML methods limits our ability to comprehend the underlying applied logic and merely allow us to obtain results. Consequently, understanding the intricate models created for emotion recognition is still vital. ML techniques, such as Random Forest (RF) and Decision Tree (DT) classifiers, were used to predict emotional labels on a dataset collected from an actual study that includes environmental and physiological sensors. In this paper, four performance indicators were used to evaluate the results: precision, recall, precision, and F1 score. Based on the findings, the RF and DT algorithms demonstrated impressive performance with an average accuracy of 98%, precision of 97.8%, recall of 97.8%, and F-measure of 98.2%. Furthermore, this paper discusses the use of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, such as Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) that were implemented and applied to the results obtained from these ML methods, to improve the interpretability and transparency of emotion recognition systems that integrate physiological signals and environmental factors. This article investigates the significance of these methods in providing insights into the relationships between human emotions and external stimuli and their potential to advance personalized and context-based applications in various domains.

AB  - (1) Background: Predictive modeling is becoming increasingly relevant in healthcare, aiding in clinical decision making and improving patient outcomes. However, many of the most potent predictive models, such as deep learning algorithms, are inherently opaque, and their decisions are challenging to interpret. This study addresses this challenge by employing Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to facilitate model interpretability while maintaining prediction accuracy. (2) Methods: We utilized Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs) to predict patient outcomes in an emergency department setting, with a focus on model transparency to ensure actionable insights. (3) Results: Our analysis identifies "Acuity", "Hours", and "Age" as critical predictive features. We provide a detailed exploration of their intricate interactions and effects on the model's predictions. The SHAP summary plots highlight that "Acuity" has the highest impact on predictions, followed by "Hours" and "Age". Dependence plots further reveal that higher acuity levels and longer hours are associated with poorer patient outcomes, while age shows a non-linear relationship with outcomes. Additionally, SHAP interaction values uncover that the interaction between "Acuity" and "Hours" significantly influences predictions. (4) Conclusions: We employed force plots for individual-level interpretation, aligning with the current shift toward personalized medicine. This research highlights the potential of combining machine learning's predictive power with interpretability, providing a promising route concerning a data-driven, evidence-based healthcare future.

AB  - Effective treatment for brain tumors relies on accurate detection because this is a crucial health condition. Medical imaging plays a pivotal role in improving tumor detection and diagnosis in the early stage. This study presents two approaches to the tumor detection problem focusing on the healthcare domain. A combination of image processing, vision transformer (ViT), and machine learning algorithms is the first approach that focuses on analyzing medical images. The second approach is the parallel model integration technique, where we first integrate two pre-trained deep learning models, ResNet101, and Xception, followed by applying local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) to explain the model. The results obtained an accuracy of 98.17% for the combination of vision transformer, random forest and contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization and 99. 67% for the parallel model integration (ResNet101 and Xception). Based on these results, this paper proposed the deep learning approach-parallel model integration technique as the most effective method. Future work aims to extend the model to multi-class classification for tumor type detection and improve model generalization for broader applicability.

Explanations were benchmarked against true clinical deterioration triggers recorded in the data system and agreement was quantified. The evaluation was conducted using two Electronic Medical Records datasets from major hospitals in Australia. Results were examined and commented on by a senior clinician.ResultsFindings demonstrate a violation of consistency criteria and moderate concordance (0.47-0.8) with true triggers, undermining reliability and actionability, criteria for clinicians' trust in XAI.ConclusionExplanations are not trustworthy to guide clinical interventions, though they may offer useful insights and help model troubleshooting. Clinician-informed XAI development and presentation, clear disclaimers on limitations, and critical clinical judgment can promote informed decisions and prevent over-reliance.

AB  - Featured Application Machine-Learning Support for Hospital Admission Decisions.Abstract The study explores the application of automated machine learning (AutoML) using the MIMIC-IV-ED database to enhance decision-making in emergency department (ED) triage. We developed a predictive model that utilizes triage data to forecast hospital admissions, aiming to support medical staff by providing an advanced decision-support system. The model, powered by H2O.ai's AutoML platform, was trained on approximately 280,000 preprocessed records from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center collected between 2011 and 2019. The selected Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) model demonstrated an AUC ROC of 0.8256, indicating its efficacy in predicting patient dispositions. Key variables such as acuity and waiting hours were identified as significant predictors, emphasizing the model's capability to integrate critical triage metrics into its predictions. However, challenges related to the complexity and heterogeneity of medical data, privacy concerns, and the need for model interpretability were addressed through the incorporation of Explainable AI (XAI) techniques. These techniques ensure the transparency of the predictive processes, fostering trust and facilitating ethical AI use in clinical settings. Future work will focus on external validation and expanding the model to include a broader array of variables from diverse healthcare environments, enhancing the model's utility and applicability in global emergency care contexts.

AB  - Although it is widely assumed that Artificial Intelligence (AI) will revolutionise healthcare in the near future, considerable progress must yet be made in order to gain the trust of healthcare professionals and patients. Improving AI transparency is a promising avenue for addressing such trust issues. However, transparency still lacks maturation and definitions. We seek to answer what challenges do experts and professionals in computing and healthcare identify concerning transparency of AI in healthcare? Here, we examine AI transparency in healthcare from five angles: interpretability, privacy, security, equity, and intellectual property. We respond to this question based on recent literature discussing the transparency of AI in healthcare and on an international online survey we sent to professionals working in computing and healthcare and potentially within AI. We collected responses from 40 professionals around the world. Overall, the survey results and current state of the art suggest key problems are a generalised lack of information available to the general public, a lack of understanding of transparency aspects covered in this work, and a lack of involvement of all stakeholders in the development of AI systems. We propose a set of recommendations, the implementation of which can enhance the transparency of AI in healthcare.

KW  - NETWORKS
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) researchers and radiologists have recently reported AI systems that accurately detect COVID-19 in chest radiographs. However, the robustness of these systems remains unclear. Using state-of-the-art techniques in explainable AI, we demonstrate that recent deep learning systems to detect COVID-19 from chest radiographs rely on confounding factors rather than medical pathology, creating an alarming situation in which the systems appear accurate, but fail when tested in new hospitals. We observe that the approach to obtain training data for these AI systems introduces a nearly ideal scenario for AI to learn these spurious 'shortcuts'. Because this approach to data collection has also been used to obtain training data for the detection of COVID-19 in computed tomography scans and for medical imaging tasks related to other diseases, our study reveals a far-reaching problem in medical-imaging AI. In addition, we show that evaluation of a model on external data is insufficient to ensure AI systems rely on medically relevant pathology, because the undesired 'shortcuts' learned by AI systems may not impair performance in new hospitals. These findings demonstrate that explainable AI should be seen as a prerequisite to clinical deployment of machine-learning healthcare models.
   The urgency of the developing COVID-19 epidemic has led to a large number of novel diagnostic approaches, many of which use machine learning. DeGrave and colleagues use explainable AI techniques to analyse a selection of these approaches and find that the methods frequently learn to identify features unrelated to the actual disease.

AB  - This perspective delves into the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance early diagnosis in hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). Despite significantly impacting Quality of Life, HS presents diagnostic challenges leading to treatment delays. We present a viewpoint on AI -powered clinical decision support system designed for HS, emphasizing the transformative potential of AI in dermatology. HS diagnosis, primarily reliant on clinical evaluation and visual inspection, often results in late -stage identification with substantial tissue damage. The incorporation of AI, utilizing machine learning and deep learning algorithms, addresses this challenge by excelling in image analysis. AI adeptly recognizes subtle patterns in skin lesions, providing objective and standardized analyses to mitigate subjectivity in traditional diagnostic approaches. The AI integration encompasses diverse datasets, including clinical records, images, biochemical and immunological data and OMICs data. AI algorithms enable nuanced comprehension, allowing for precise and customized diagnoses. We underscore AI's potential for continuous learning and adaptation, refining recommendations based on evolving data. Challenges in AI integration, such as data privacy, algorithm bias, and interpretability, are addressed, emphasizing the ethical considerations of responsible AI deployment, including transparency, human oversight, and striking a balance between automation and human intervention. From the dermatologists' standpoint, we illustrate how AI enhances diagnostic accuracy, treatment planning, and long-term follow-up in HS management.

AB  - The amalgamation of blockchain-distributed ledger technology (BDLT) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has the potential to revolutionize modern healthcare. The present research draws attention to the existing constraints on patient trust, preservation, data security and privacy, and moral judgment. Using BDLT-integrated XAI, this study offers a novel framework for developing secure, personalized, transparent, and privacy-protected healthcare decision-making. The suggested framework is assessed using several important metrics, including as interpretability accuracy, which is 92.85% in user comprehension tests. Both data security, which employs blockchain technology to verify a 98.97% success rate in limiting unauthorized access/gained access, and privacy preservation, which upholds standardization compliance to 96.78%, have an impact on user satisfaction with the general data protection regulation (GDPR). The research includes the diagnostics' accuracy rate, which increases AI-driven diagnoses by 97.12% using blockchain-verified data. Positive evaluations of patient-physician interactions indicate that the trustworthiness rate is up to 94.33%. It seamlessly integrates with a variety of healthcare apps and achieves 99.02% platform interoperability. When compared to other state-of-the-art methods, the BDLT-powered artificial intelligence-driven refining process validates data and demonstrates an efficiency boost of up to 89.45%. The scalability and effectiveness of the proposed framework are confirmed by simulations and real-world situations. It emphasizes primarily the potential to transform healthcare through the promotion of moral behavior. With increased transparency, this paper empowers patients and improves treatment results. The findings open the door to a new era of ethical and precise medicine by establishing a secure, private, reliable, and customized approach to AI adoption in healthcare.

AB  - Early detection of brain tumors is vital for improving patient survival rates, yet the manual analysis of the extensive 3D MRI images can be error-prone and time-consuming. This study introduces the Deep Explainable Brain Tumor Deep Network (DeepEBTDNet), a novel deep learning model for binary classification of brain MRIs as tumorous or normal. Employing sub-image dualistic histogram equalization (DSIHE) for enhanced image quality, DeepEBTDNet utilizes 12 convolutional layers with leaky ReLU (LReLU) activation for feature extraction, followed by a fully connected classification layer. Transparency and interpretability are emphasized through the application of the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) method to explain model predictions. Results demonstrate DeepEBTDNet's efficacy in brain tumor detection, even across datasets, achieving a validation accuracy of 98.96% and testing accuracy of 94.0%. This study underscores the importance of explainable AI in healthcare, facilitating precise diagnoses and transparent decision-making for early brain tumor identification and improved patient outcomes.

AB  - Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) and fair learning have made significant strides in various application domains, including criminal recidivism predictions, healthcare settings, toxic comment detection, automatic speech detection, recommendation systems, and image segmentation. However, these two fields have largely evolved independently. Recent studies have demonstrated that incorporating explanations into decision-making processes enhances the transparency and trustworthiness of AI systems. In light of this, our objective is to conduct a systematic review of FairXAI, which explores the interplay between fairness and explainability frameworks. To commence, we propose a taxonomy of FairXAI that utilizes XAI to mitigate and evaluate bias. This taxonomy will be a base for machine learning researchers operating in diverse domains. Additionally, we will undertake an extensive review of existing articles, taking into account factors such as the purpose of the interaction, target audience, and domain and context. Moreover, we outline an interaction framework for FairXAI considering various fairness perceptions and propose a FairXAI wheel that encompasses four core properties that must be verified and evaluated. This will serve as a practical tool for researchers and practitioners, ensuring the fairness and transparency of their AI systems. Furthermore, we will identify challenges and conflicts in the interactions between fairness and explainability, which could potentially pave the way for enhancing the responsibility of AI systems. As the inaugural review of its kind, we hope that this survey will inspire scholars to address these challenges by scrutinizing current research in their respective domains.

AB  - Machine Learning (ML) models integrated with in-situ sensing offer transformative solutions for defect detection in Additive Manufacturing (AM), but this integration brings critical challenges in safeguarding sensitive data, such as part designs and material compositions. Differential Privacy (DP), which introduces mathematically controlled noise, provides a balance between data utility and privacy. However, black-box Artificial Intelligence (AI) models often obscure how this noise impacts model accuracy, complicating the optimization of privacy-accuracy trade-offs. This study introduces the Differential Privacy-Hyperdimensional Computing (DP-HD) framework, a novel approach combining Explainable AI (XAI) and vector symbolic paradigms to quantify and predict noise effects on accuracy using a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) metric. DP-HD enables precise tuning of DP noise levels, ensuring an optimal balance between privacy and performance. The framework has been validated using real-world AM data, demonstrating its applicability to industrial environments. Experimental results demonstrate DP-HD's capability to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy (94.43%) with robust privacy protections in anomaly detection for AM, even under significant noise conditions. Beyond AM, DP-HD holds substantial promise for broader applications in privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare, financial services, and government data management, where securing sensitive data while maintaining high ML performance is paramount.

TI  - Evaluating Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques in chest radiology imaging through a human-centered Lens
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - The field of radiology imaging has experienced a remarkable increase in using of deep learning (DL) algorithms to support diagnostic and treatment decisions. This rise has led to the development of Explainable AI (XAI) system to improve the transparency and trust of complex DL methods. However, XAI systems face challenges in gaining acceptance within the healthcare sector, mainly due to technical hurdles in utilizing these systems in practice and the lack of human-centered evaluation/validation. In this study, we focus on visual XAI systems applied to DL-enabled diagnostic system in chest radiography. In particular, we conduct a user study to evaluate two prominent visual XAI techniques from the human perspective. To this end, we created two clinical scenarios for diagnosing pneumonia and COVID-19 using DL techniques applied to chest X-ray and CT scans. The achieved accuracy rates were 90% for pneumonia and 98% for COVID-19. Subsequently, we employed two well-known XAI methods, Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations), to generate visual explanations elucidating the AI decision-making process. The visual explainability results were shared through a user study, undergoing evaluation by medical professionals in terms of clinical relevance, coherency, and user trust. In general, participants expressed a positive perception of the use of XAI systems in chest radiography. However, there was a noticeable lack of awareness regarding their value and practical aspects. Regarding preferences, Grad-CAM showed superior performance over LIME in terms of coherency and trust, although concerns were raised about its clinical usability. Our findings highlight key user-driven explainability requirements, emphasizing the importance of multi-modal explainability and the necessity to increase awareness of XAI systems among medical practitioners. Inclusive design was also identified as a crucial need to ensure better alignment of these systems with user needs.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated potential in healthcare, particularly in enhancing diagnostic accuracy and decision-making through Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSSs). However, the successful implementation of these systems relies on user trust and reliance, which can be influenced by explainable AI. This study explores the impact of varying explainability levels on clinicians' trust, cognitive load, and diagnostic performance in breast cancer detection. Utilizing an interrupted time series design, we conducted a web-based experiment involving 28 healthcare professionals. The results revealed that high confidence scores substantially increased trust but also led to overreliance, reducing diagnostic accuracy. In contrast, low confidence scores decreased trust and agreement while increasing diagnosis duration, reflecting more cautious behavior. Some explainability features influenced cognitive load by increasing stress levels. Additionally, demographic factors such as age, gender, and professional role shaped participants' perceptions and interactions with the system. This study provides valuable insights into how explainability impact clinicians' behavior and decision-making. The findings highlight the importance of designing AI-driven CDSSs that balance transparency, usability, and cognitive demands to foster trust and improve integration into clinical workflows.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a global healthcare challenge lacking a simple and affordable detection method. We propose a novel deep learning framework, Eye-AD, to detect Early-onset Alzheimer's Disease (EOAD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) using OCTA images of retinal microvasculature and choriocapillaris. Eye-AD employs a multilevel graph representation to analyze intra- and inter-instance relationships in retinal layers. Using 5751 OCTA images from 1671 participants in a multi-center study, our model demonstrated superior performance in EOAD (internal data: AUC = 0.9355, external data: AUC = 0.9007) and MCI detection (internal data: AUC = 0.8630, external data: AUC = 0.8037). Furthermore, we explored the associations between retinal structural biomarkers in OCTA images and EOAD/MCI, and the results align well with the conclusions drawn from our deep learning interpretability analysis. Our findings provide further evidence that retinal OCTA imaging, coupled with artificial intelligence, will serve as a rapid, noninvasive, and affordable dementia detection.

AB  - Real-world clinical experience provides a much-needed opportunity for deep learning AI algorithms to evolve and improve. Yet, it also constitutes a regulatory challenge, since such potential for learning may essentially change the algorithm and introduce new biases. We focus on the gaps between "lifecycle" regulation and implementation from the perspective of the deployers, addressing three interconnected dimensions: (a) How precautionary regulation affects AI deployment in healthcare, (b) How healthcare providers view explainable AI (XAI), and (c) How AI deployment influences, and is influenced by, team routines in clinical settings. We conclude by suggesting ways in which the ends of healthcare AI regulation and deployment can successfully meet.

AB  - The application of deep learning algorithms for medical diagnosis in the real world faces challenges with transparency and interpretability. The labeling of large-scale samples leads to costly investment in developing deep learning algorithms. The application of human prior knowledge is an effective way to solve these problems. Previously, we developed a deep learning system for glaucoma diagnosis based on a large number of samples that had high sensitivity and specificity. However, it is a black box and the specific analytic methods cannot be elucidated. Here, we establish a hierarchical deep learning system based on a small number of samples that comprehensively simulates the diagnostic thinking of human experts. This system can extract the anatomical characteristics of the fundus images, including the optic disc, optic cup, and appearance of the retinal nerve fiber layer to realize automatic diagnosis of glaucoma. In addition, this system is transparent and interpretable, and the intermediate process of prediction can be visualized. Applying this system to three validation datasets of fundus images, we demonstrate performance comparable to that of human experts in diagnosing glaucoma. Moreover, it markedly improves the diagnostic accuracy of ophthalmologists. This system may expedite the screening and diagnosis of glaucoma, resulting in improved clinical outcomes.

AB  - Accurate predictive models are crucial for early detection and intervention of Heart Disease (HD), which continues to be a major cause of death worldwide. However, the challenges of high dimensionality and data imbalance affect the precision and generalizability of predictions. We propose a novel deep model, the Fully Connected Wave Network (FCW-Net), for early HD prediction. To mitigate class imbalance, Proximity Weighted Synthetic (ProWSyn) oversampling technique is employed, while Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce dimensionality, enhancing model efficiency and prediction accuracy. With an AUC-ROC of 0.9622, an accuracy of 0.9237, a precision of 0.8856, an F1-score of 0.9268, and a recall of 0.9721, our results demonstrate that the FCW-Net deep model achieves superior performance than baseline models when using PCA and ProWSyn. Model transparency is further improved by eXplainable Artificial Intelligence technique, SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis, which provides insights into feature contributions to HD risk.

AB  - Explainable AI (XAI) is increasingly being used in the healthcare domain. In health management, clinicians and patients are critical stakeholders, requiring tailored XAI explanations based on their unique needs. Our study investigates the differences in explanation needs between clinicians and patients and designs corresponding explanation interfaces for each group. Using a scenario-based approach, we assessed stakeholder-tailored needs, analyzed differences, and designed interfaces using theoretical frameworks. The results demonstrate diverse stakeholder motivations for seeking explanations, leading to varied requirements. The designed interfaces effectively address these requirements, as validated by the preference selection and qualitative feedback from clinicians and patients. Their suggestions provide design insights and highlight the divergent needs of these stakeholder groups. This study contributes practical and theoretical implications to XAI research, emphasizing the importance of understanding diverse stakeholder needs and incorporating relevant theoretical concepts into user-centered interface design.

AB  - The relevance of the study is due to the growing number of diseases of the cerebrovascular system, in particular stroke, which is one of the leading causes of disability and mortality in the world. To improve stroke risk prediction models in terms of efficiency and interpretability, we propose to integrate modern machine learning algorithms and data dimensionality reduction methods, in particular XGBoost and optimized principal component analysis (PCA), which provide data structuring and increase processing speed, especially for large datasets. For the first time, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is integrated into the PCA process, which increases transparency and interpretation, providing a better understanding of risk factors for medical professionals. The proposed approach was tested on two datasets, with accuracy of 95% and 98%. Cross-validation yielded an average value of 0.99, and high values of Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) metrics of 0.96 and Cohen's Kappa (CK) of 0.96 confirmed the generalizability and reliability of the model. The processing speed is increased threefold due to OpenMP parallelization, which makes it possible to apply it in practice. Thus, the proposed method is innovative and can potentially improve forecasting systems in the healthcare industry.

AB  - More than 14% of the world's population suffered from diabetes mellitus in 2022. This metabolic condition is defined by increased blood glucose concentrations. Among the different types of diabetes, type 1 diabetes, caused by a lack of insulin secretion, is particularly challenging to treat. In this regard, automatic glucose level estimation implements Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) devices, showing positive therapeutic outcomes. AI-based glucose prediction has commonly followed a deterministic approach, usually with a lack of interpretability. Therefore, these AI-based methods do not provide enough information in critical decision-making scenarios, like in the medical field. This work intends to provide accurate, interpretable, and personalized glucose prediction using the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), and also includes an uncertainty estimation. The TFT was trained using two databases, an in-house-collected dataset and the OhioT1DM dataset, commonly used for glucose forecasting benchmarking. For both datasets, the set of input features to train the model was varied to assess their impact on model interpretability and prediction performance. Models were evaluated using common prediction metrics, diabetes-specific metrics, uncertainty estimation, and interpretability of the model, including feature importance and attention. The obtained results showed that TFT outperforms existing methods in terms of RMSE by at least 13% for both datasets.

TI  - Explainable artificial intelligence for cough-related quality of life impairment prediction in asthmatic patients
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is becoming a disruptive trend in healthcare, allowing for transparency and interpretability of autonomous decision-making. In this study, we present an innovative application of a rule-based classification model to identify the main causes of chronic cough-related quality of life (QoL) impairment in a cohort of asthmatic patients. The proposed approach first involves the design of a suitable symptoms questionnaire and the subsequent analyses via XAI. Specifically, feature ranking, derived from statistically validated decision rules, helped in automatically identifying the main factors influencing an impaired QoL: pharynx/larynx and upper airways when asthma is under control, and asthma itself and digestive trait when asthma is not controlled. Moreover, the obtained if-then rules identified specific thresholds on the symptoms associated to the impaired QoL. These results, by finding priorities among symptoms, may prove helpful in supporting physicians in the choice of the most adequate diagnostic/therapeutic plan.

AB  - Advances in Machine Learning and availability of state-of-the-art computational resources, along with digitized healthcare data, have set the stage for extensive application of artificial intelligence in the realm of diagnosis, prognosis, clinical decision support, personalized treatment options, drug development, and the field of biomedicine. Here, we discuss the application of Machine Learning algorithms in patient healthcare and dermatological domains along with the ethical complexities that are involved. In scientific studies, ethical challenges were initially not addressed proportionally (as assessed by keyword counts in PubMed) and just more recently (since 2016) this has started to improve. Few pioneering countries have created regulatory guidelines around how to respect matters of (1) privacy, (2) fairness, (3) accountability, (4) transparency and (5) conflict of interest when developing novel medical Machine Learning applications. While there is a strong promise of emerging medical applications to ultimately benefit both the patients and the medical practitioners, it is important to raise awareness on the five key ethical issues and incorporate them into medical practice in the near future.

AB  - Simple Summary To treat diseases caused by genetic mutations, such as mutations in genes and cancer cells, genomic medicine is being promoted to identify disease-causing variants in individual patients using comprehensive genetic analysis (next-generation sequencing, or NGS) for diagnosis and treatment. However, clinical interpretation of the large amount of variant data output by NGS is a time-consuming task and has become a bottleneck in the promotion of genomic medicine. Although AI development to support this task has been conducted in various fields, none has yet been realized that has both high estimation accuracy and explainability at the same time. Therefore, we propose an AI with high estimation accuracy and explanatory power, which will eliminate the bottlenecks in genomic medicine. Background: To treat diseases caused by genetic variants, it is necessary to identify disease-causing variants in patients. However, since there are a large number of disease-causing variants, the application of AI is required. We propose AI to solve this problem and report the results of its application in identifying disease-causing variants. Methods: To assist physicians in their task of identifying disease-causing variants, we propose an explainable AI (XAI) that combines high estimation accuracy with explainability using a knowledge graph. We integrated databases for genomic medicine and constructed a large knowledge graph that was used to achieve the XAI. Results: We compared our XAI with random forests and decision trees. Conclusion: We propose an XAI that uses knowledge graphs for explanation. The proposed method achieves high estimation performance and explainability. This will support the promotion of genomic medicine.

AB  - Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disease that severely impairs cognitive function. Early detection is critical for effective treatment and management. Machine Learning (ML) methods are often used to ensure early detection and prediction. However, ML has various issues, including the data island problem. The fragmentation that results from the data island problem makes building reliable, effective ML models more complex, and it is particularly problematic in industries where privacy is a concern, like healthcare. Federated Learning (FL) can help tackle the data island problem by keeping sensitive patient data decentralized and enabling many institutions to work together on model training without exchanging raw data, all while maintaining privacy compliance. As Random Forest (RF) is proven to be the best-performing classifier in this research, an RF classifier is used to create FL. The model incorporates multiple data modalities, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) segmentation and clinical and psychological data, to capture the variety of characteristics influencing the progress of AD. Another concerning issue with ML is its uninterpretable character. We use SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques that emphasize important factors impacting model decisions in order to improve predictability and transparency. This explainability promotes confidence in AI-based diagnoses by enabling researchers and physicians to comprehend the underlying mechanisms guiding the predictions. The combination of XAI, FL, and Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3) Multimodal data offers an interpretable, scalable, reliable, and privacy-centered solution for multiple complex issues, such as predicting AD. This approach results in better diagnosis precision, greater security, and increased confidence in AI technologies, making it a novel methodology in medical sciences. With data privacy maintained, our method produces 98.93% accurate predictions, providing a solid detection strategy for AD. The suggested approach's F1-score, Precision, Recall, and AUC are 98.93%, 98.94%, 98.93%, and 99.97%, respectively. This work also shows that a multimodal dataset performs better than a single modal dataset.

AB  - Objective: Drug sustainability (DS), a surrogate marker for drug efficacy, is important, especially when aiming for precision medicine. However, it lacks reliable prediction methods. Aims: To develop and externally validate a web-based artificial intelligence(AI)-derived tool for predicting DS of infliximab and vedolizumab in patients with moderate-to-severe Ulcerative Colitis (UC). Methods: Data from three Israeli centers included infliximab or vedolizumab patients treated for > 54 weeks. Sustainability meant no corticosteroids, hospitalizations or surgeries. Machine learning techniques predicted > 54-week and overall DS using baseline clinical data. Results: The model was developed using data from 246 patients from Rabin Medical Center and externally validated on 67 patients from Rambam Health Care Campus and Sheba Medical Center. No significant difference in DS was observed across the datasets. Most patients were biologic-na & iuml;ve and primarily treated with vedolizumab. The model performed well, with an area under the ROC curve of 0.86, and showed good accuracy (65.5 %-76.9 %) across the test sets. Conclusions: The study introduces a novel, AI-based tool for predicting > 54-week DS of infliximab and vedolizumab in moderate-to-severe UC, using baseline parameters. This can aid clinical decision-making in the framework of precision medicine, promising to optimize disease management while maintaining physician autonomy.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Liver cancer ranks among the leading causes of cancer-related mortality, necessitating the development of novel diagnostic methods. Deregulated lipid metabolism, a hallmark of hepatocarcinogenesis, offers compelling prospects for biomarker identification. This study aims to employ explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to identify lipidomic biomarkers for liver cancer and to develop a robust predictive model for early diagnosis. Materials and Methods: This study included 219 patients diagnosed with liver cancer and 219 healthy controls. Serum samples underwent untargeted lipidomic analysis with LC-QTOF-MS. Lipidomic data underwent univariate and multivariate analyses, including fold change (FC), t-tests, PLS-DA, and Elastic Network feature selection, to identify significant biomarker candidate lipids. Machine learning models (AdaBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) were developed and evaluated utilizing these biomarkers to differentiate liver cancer. The AUC metric was employed to identify the optimal predictive model, whereas SHAP was utilized to achieve interpretability of the model's predictive decisions. Results: Notable alterations in lipid profiles were observed: decreased sphingomyelins (SM d39:2, SM d41:2) and increased fatty acids (FA 14:1, FA 22:2) and phosphatidylcholines (PC 34:1, PC 32:1). AdaBoost exhibited a superior classification performance, achieving an AUC of 0.875. SHAP identified PC 40:4 as the most efficacious lipid for model predictions. The SM d41:2 and SM d36:3 lipids were specifically associated with an increased risk of low-onset cancer and elevated levels of the PC 40:4 lipid. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that untargeted lipidomics, in conjunction with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) and machine learning, may effectively identify biomarkers for the early detection of liver cancer. The results suggest that alterations in lipid metabolism are crucial to the progression of liver cancer and provide valuable insights for incorporating lipidomics into precision oncology.

AB  - The increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in several industries has created a demand for user-centered explanations that align with how users think and understand concepts. This paper presents EXACT (EXplainable AI with Cognitive Theories), a novel framework that combines cognitive theories that explain how people think and understand with cognitive functions, focusing on perception, memory and language abilities, to improve users' comprehension of and engagement with artificial intelligence technologies. By aligning cognitive functions with the design principles of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), which promote user-centered intuitive systems. the framework addresses challenges related to making AI understandable to users with various levels of cognitive abilities. As a proof-of-concept, a self-diagnosis tool was created to demonstrate the framework's effectiveness. Then, 60 participants were divided into a control group and an experimental group. Participants completed six tasks designed to evaluate their perception, memory, and language-related cognitive functions. The experimental group outperformed the control group across all tasks, demonstrating significantly improved performance. Subjective metrics also supported these findings: the experimental group reported higher levels of understanding (4.60 vs. 2.87), confidence (4.67 vs. 3.07), and clarity (4.87 vs. 2.80) compared to the control group. These findings suggest that EXACT framework significantly enhances user's functions when using AI systems. However, further research is needed to explore its broader applicability in other contexts and utilize other cognitive functions.

AB  - Improving early diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in children increasingly relies on predictive models that are reliable and accessible to non-experts. This study aims to develop such models using Pythonbased tools to improve ASD diagnosis in clinical settings. We performed exploratory data analysis to ensure data quality and identify key patterns in pediatric ASD data. We selected the categorical boosting (CatBoost) algorithm to effectively handle the large number of categorical variables. We used the PyCaret automated machine learning (AutoML) tool to make the models user-friendly for clinicians without extensive machine learning expertise. In addition, we applied Shapley additive explanations (SHAP), an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) technique, to improve the interpretability of the models. Models developed using CatBoost and other AI algorithms showed high accuracy in diagnosing ASD in children. SHAP provided clear insights into the influence of each variable on diagnostic outcomes, making model decisions transparent and understandable to healthcare professionals. By integrating robust machine learning methods with user-friendly tools such as PyCaret and leveraging XAI techniques such as SHAP, this study contributes to the development of reliable, interpretable, and accessible diagnostic tools for ASD. These advances hold great promise for supporting informed decision-making in clinical settings, ultimately improving early identification and intervention strategies for ASD in the pediatric population. However, the study is limited by the dataset's demographic imbalance and the lack of external clinical validation, which should be addressed in future research.

AB  - In recent years personalized medicine reached an increasing importance, especially in the design of oncological therapies. In particular, the development of patients' profiling strategies suggests the possibility of promising rewards. In this work, we present an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework based on an adaptive dimensional reduction which (i) outlines the most important clinical features for oncological patients' profiling and (ii), based on these features, determines the profile, i.e., the cluster a patient belongs to. For these purposes, we collected a cohort of 267 breast cancer patients. The adopted dimensional reduction method determines the relevant subspace where distances among patients are used by a hierarchical clustering procedure to identify the corresponding optimal categories. Our results demonstrate how the molecular subtype is the most important feature for clustering. Then, we assessed the robustness of current therapies and guidelines; our findings show a striking correspondence between available patients' profiles determined in an unsupervised way and either molecular subtypes or therapies chosen according to guidelines, which guarantees the interpretability characterizing explainable approaches to machine learning techniques. Accordingly, our work suggests the possibility to design data-driven therapies to emphasize the differences observed among the patients.

AB  - Background and objectives: Breast cancer (BC) is the most common type of cancer in women, accounting for more than 30% of new female cancers each year. Although various treatments are available for BC, most cancer-related deaths are due to incurable metastases. Therefore, the early diagnosis and treatment of BC are crucial before metastasis. Mammography and ultrasonography are primarily used in the clinic for the initial identification and staging of BC; these methods are useful for general screening but have limitations in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Omics-based biomarkers, like metabolomics, can make early diagnosis much more accurate, make tracking the disease's progression more accurate, and help make personalized treatment plans that are tailored to each tumor's specific molecular profile. Metabolomics technology is a feasible and comprehensive method for early disease detection and biomarker identification at the molecular level. This research aimed to establish an interpretable predictive artificial intelligence (AI) model using plasma-based metabolomics panel data to identify potential biomarkers that distinguish BC individuals from healthy controls. Method and materials: A cohort of 138 BC patients and 76 healthy controls were studied. Plasma metabolites were examined using LC-TOFMS and GC-TOFMS techniques. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), and Random Forest (RF) were evaluated using performance metrics such as Receiver Operating Characteristic-Area Under the Curve (ROC AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score. ROC and Precision-Recall (PR) curves were generated for comparative analysis. The SHapley Additive Descriptions (SHAP) analysis evaluated the optimal prediction model for interpretability. Results: The RF algorithm showed improved accuracy (0.963 +/- 0.043) and sensitivity (0.977 +/- 0.051); however, LightGBM achieved the highest ROC AUC (0.983 +/- 0.028). RF also achieved the best Precision-Recall Area under the Curve (PR AUC) at 0.989. SHAP search found glycerophosphocholine and pentosidine as the most significant discriminatory metabolites. Uracil, glutamine, and butyrylcarnitine were also among the significant metabolites. Conclusions: Metabolomics biomarkers and an explainable AI (XAI)-based prediction model showed significant diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity in the detection of BC. The proposed XAI system using interpretable metabolite data can serve as a clinical decision support tool to improve early diagnosis processes.

AB  - The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning profoundly impacts medical imaging, where it significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy. However, the effective deployment of AI systems in clinical settings, especially for skin lesion detection and diagnosis, requires not only high accuracy but also transparency and robustness to gain the trust of healthcare professionals. This is particularly crucial considering the challenges posed by varying sensor quality, lighting conditions, and lesion diversity. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework based on the You Only Look Once (YOLO) model that addresses these critical needs by enhancing both the explainability and performance of skin lesion detection models. Early and accurate identification of skin lesions is essential for the timely treatment and management of dermatological conditions. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as visual assessments by dermatologists, are often labor-intensive, subject to interpretative variability, and prone to inaccuracies, especially in cases involving atypical or subtle lesions. Our approach incorporates advanced data augmentation techniques to improve the model's generalization capabilities across diverse clinical conditions. Additionally, we integrate saliency maps to provide visual explanations of the model's predictions, allowing clinicians to understand the decision-making process and ensuring alignment with established clinical knowledge.

AB  - With the rise Artificial Intelligence (AI), mitigation strategies may be needed to integrate AI-enabled medical software responsibly, ensuring ethical alignment and patient safety. This study examines how to mitigate the key risks identified by the European Parliamentary Research Service (EPRS). For that, we discuss how complementary risk-mitigation requirements may ensure the main aspects of AI in Healthcare: Reliability - Continuous performance evaluation, Continuous usability test, Encryption and use of field-tested libraries, Semantic interoperability -, Transparency - AI passport, eXplainable AI, Data quality assessment, Bias Check -, Traceability - User management, Audit trail, Review of cases-, and Responsibility - Regulation check, Academic use only disclaimer, Clinicians double check -. A survey conducted among 216 Medical ICT professionals (medical doctors, ICT staff and complementary profiles) between March and June 2024 revealed these requirements were perceived positive by all profiles. Responders deemed explainable AI and data quality assessment essential for transparency; audit trail for traceability; and regulatory compliance and clinician double check for responsibility. Clinicians rated the following requirements more relevant (p < 0.05) than technicians: continuous performance assessment, usability testing, encryption, AI passport, retrospective case review, and academic use check. Additionally, users found the AI passport more relevant for transparency than decision-makers (p < 0.05). We trust that this proposal can serve as a starting point to endow the future AI systems in medical practice with requirements to ensure their ethical deployment.

AB  - Postural deficits such as hyperlordosis (hollow back) or hyperkyphosis (hunchback) are relevant health issues. Diagnoses depend on the experience of the examiner and are, therefore, often subjective and prone to errors. Machine learning (ML) methods in combination with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) tools have proven useful for providing an objective, data-based orientation. However, only a few works have considered posture parameters, leaving the potential for more human-friendly XAI interpretations still untouched. Therefore, the present work proposes an objective, data-driven ML system for medical decision support that enables especially human-friendly interpretations using counterfactual explanations (CFs). The posture data for 1151 subjects were recorded by means of stereophotogrammetry. An expert-based classification of the subjects regarding the presence of hyperlordosis or hyperkyphosis was initially performed. Using a Gaussian progress classifier, the models were trained and interpreted using CFs. The label errors were flagged and re-evaluated using confident learning. Very good classification performances for both hyperlordosis and hyperkyphosis were found, whereby the re-evaluation and correction of the test labels led to a significant improvement (M-PRAUC = 0.97). A statistical evaluation showed that the CFs seemed to be plausible, in general. In the context of personalized medicine, the present study's approach could be of importance for reducing diagnostic errors and thereby improving the individual adaptation of therapeutic measures. Likewise, it could be a basis for the development of apps for preventive posture assessment.

AB  - Prenatal healthcare development requires accurate automated techniques for fetal ultrasound image segmentation. This approach allows standardized evaluation of fetal development by minimizing time-exhaustive processes that perform poorly due to human intervention. This research develops a segmentation framework through U-Net++ with ResNet backbone features which incorporates attention components for enhancing extraction of features in low contrast, noisy ultrasound data. The model leverages the nested skip connections of U-Net++ and the residual learning of ResNet-34 to achieve state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy. Evaluations of the developed model against the vast fetal ultrasound image collection yielded superior results by reaching 97.52% Dice coefficient as well as 95.15% Intersection over Union (IoU), and 3.91 mm Hausdorff distance. The pipeline integrated Grad-CAM++ allows explanations of the model decisions for clinical utility and trust enhancement. The explainability component enables medical professionals to study how the model functions, which creates clear and proven segmentation outputs for better overall reliability. The framework fills in the gap between AI automation and clinical interpretability by showing important areas which affect predictions. The research shows that deep learning combined with Explainable AI (XAI) operates to generate medical imaging solutions that achieve high accuracy. The proposed system demonstrates readiness for clinical workflows due to its ability to deliver a sophisticated prenatal diagnostic instrument that enhances healthcare results.

AB  - Obesity is a complex global health issue with severe implications for both individual well-being and public health systems. It has been traditionally challenging to predict and diagnose due to its multifactorial nature, involving genetic, behavioral, and environmental factors. While classical regression models have been extensively used for obesity prediction, their limitations have prompted the exploration of more advanced methodologies. In this study, we leverage Deep Learning (DL) techniques, particularly TabNet, to address the challenges of obesity classification in tabular data-a domain where DL's potential has often been underutilized. Our approach enhances the TabNet architecture through effective hyperparameter tuning, utilizing Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), and Hunger Games Search (HGS). The resulting models, TabNet-PSO, TabNet-GWO, and TabNet-HGS are combined into a novel ensemble that demonstrates superior performance in obesity classification compared to conventional machine-learning models and recent studies. Additionally, Explainable Artificial Intelligence techniques are employed to provide both local and global interpretability of model predictions, using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). This interpretability is crucial in clinical settings, where understanding the underlying factors influencing predictions is essential. The study's findings offer significant contributions to the early detection and management of obesity, providing healthcare professionals with precise and interpretable predictions to guide intervention strategies.

AB  - Smart cities provide an ideal framework for the integration of advanced healthcare applications, such as early Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection that is essential to facilitate timely interventions and slow its progression. In this context, speech analysis, combined with Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, has emerged as a promising approach for the automatic detection of AD, as vocal biomarkers can provide valuable indicators of cognitive decline. The proposed approach focuses on two key goals: minimizing computational overhead while maintaining high accuracy, and improving model interpretability for clinical usability. To enhance efficiency, the framework incorporates a data quality method that removes unreliable speech segments based on duration thresholds and applies Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to select the most influential acoustic features. SHAP is also used to improve interpretability by providing global and local explanations of model decisions. The final model, that is based on Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), achieves an F1-Score of 0.7692 on the ADReSS dataset, showing good performance and a satisfactory level of clinical utility. This work highlights the potential of explainable AI to bridge machine learning techniques with clinically meaningful insights in the domain of AD detection from speech.

KW  - Explainable artificial intelligence
KW  - Black box systems
KW  - Professional liability
KW  - Radiology
KW  - Ethics
AB  - Radiology is one of the medical specialties most significantly impacted by Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI systems, particularly those employing machine and deep learning, excel in processing large datasets and comparing images from similar contexts, fulfilling radiological demands. However, the implementation of AI in radiology presents notable challenges, including concerns about data privacy, informed consent, and the potential for external interferences affecting decision-making processes. Biases represent another critical issue, often stemming from unrepresentative datasets or inadequate system training, which can lead to distorted outcomes and exacerbate healthcare inequalities. Additionally, generative AI systems may produce 'hallucinations' arising from their reliance on probabilistic modeling without the ability to distinguish between true and false information. Such risks raise ethical and legal questions, especially when AI-induced errors harm patient health. Concerning liability for medical errors involving AI, healthcare professionals currently retain full accountability for their decisions. AI systems remain tools to support, not replace, human expertise and judgment. Nevertheless, the "black box" nature of many AI models - wherein the reasoning behind outputs remains opaque - limits the possibility of fully informed consent. We advocate for prioritizing Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) in radiology. While potentially less performant than black-box models, XAI enhances transparency, allowing patients to understand how their data is used and how AI influences clinical decisions, aligning with ethical standards.

AB  - Communicable diseases are transmitted through water, food, contaminated surfaces, bodily fluids, air. In such a situation, staying in home isolation for fewer chronic health problems and monitoring health status frequently through Medical Sensors (MSs) is recommended. The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in smart consumer electronics and sustainable healthcare has recently demonstrated remarkable results. However, the healthcare domain requires high levels of accountability and transparency for communicable disease prediction and sustainable life in edge networks. This paper aims to present an intelligent healthcare prototype that can identify risk factors according to monitoring parameters by analyzing the Explainable XGBoost (XXGB) model. Using edge networks for sustainable living, we explore the intersection between healthcare and consumer electronics. Initially, the prototype has been trained using the XXGB model over one publicly available dataset related to communicable diseases. Next, the prototype identifies patient risk factors by analyzing real-time monitoring parameters. Simulation results illustrate the efficiency of the proposed XXGB model up to 84.2% accuracy, which is higher than existing models.

AB  - Kidney disease is a global health concern, impacting a substantial part of the overall population and contributing to high morbidity and mortality rates. The initially diagnosed phases of kidney disease are often present without noticeable indications, leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, early detection is crucial to reducing complications and improving the lives of those impacted. However, the performance of previous automated approaches has often been hindered by suboptimal feature selection and algorithms' "black-box" nature, which adversely affect their interpretability and clinical applicability. This paper aims to address these limitations by creating an effective machine-learning-based approach that integrates ant colony metaheuristic optimization algorithms for feature selection and explainable artificial intelligence techniques such as SHAP and LIME for model interpretation. The ant colony optimization method identified the most relevant feature subsets using a clinical dataset, reducing model complexity while preserving predictive accuracy. Performance evaluation shows that the extra trees classifier, when using optimized selected features, achieved the highest performance with an accuracy of 97.70% and an area under the curve of 99.55%, outperforming previous models trained on raw and complete processed feature sets. To enhance interpretability, the SHAP and LIME explainable techniques were employed, providing detailed insights into the contribution of key features such as TimeToEventMonths, HistoryDiabetes, and Age. This comprehensive framework, combining advanced feature selection with explainable models, improves clinical decision-making and fosters trust in machine learning applications for healthcare.

AB  - Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is a life-threatening malignancy characterized by its aggressive progression and detrimental effects on the hematopoietic system. Early and accurate diagnosis is paramount to optimizing therapeutic interventions and improving clinical outcomes. This study introduces a novel diagnostic framework that synergizes the EfficientNet-B7 architecture with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methodologies to address challenges in performance, computational efficiency, and explainability. The proposed model achieves improved diagnostic performance, with accuracies exceeding 96% on the Taleqani Hospital dataset and 95.50% on the C-NMC-19 and Multi-Cancer datasets. Rigorous evaluation across multiple metrics-including Area Under the Curve (AUC), mean Average Precision (mAP), Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score-demonstrates the model's robustness and establishes its superiority over state-of-the-art architectures namely VGG-19, InceptionResNetV2, ResNet50, DenseNet50 and AlexNet . Furthermore, the framework significantly reduces computational overhead, achieving up to 40% faster inference times, thereby enhancing its clinical applicability. To address the opacity inherent in Deep learning (DL) models, the framework integrates advanced XAI techniques, including Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), Class Activation Mapping (CAM), Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), and Integrated Gradients (IG), providing transparent and explainable insights into model predictions. This fusion of high diagnostic precision, computational efficiency, and explainability positions the proposed framework as a transformative tool for ALL diagnosis, bridging the gap between cutting-edge AI technologies and practical clinical deployment.

AB  - Introduction The pressing need for accurate diagnostic tools in the medical field, particularly for diseases such as brain tumors and Alzheimer's, poses significant challenges to timely and effective treatment.Methods This study presents a novel approach to MRI image classification by integrating transfer learning with Explainable AI (XAI) techniques. The proposed method utilizes a hybrid CNN-VGG16 model, which leverages pre-trained features from the VGG16 architecture to enhance classification performance across three distinct MRI datasets: brain tumor classification, Alzheimer's disease detection, and a third dataset of brain tumors. A comprehensive preprocessing pipeline ensures optimal input quality and variability, including image normalization, resizing, and data augmentation.Results The model achieves accuracy rates of 94% on the brain tumor dataset, 81% on the augmented Alzheimer dataset, and 93% on the third dataset, underscoring its capability to differentiate various neurological conditions. Furthermore, the integration of SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) provides a transparent view of the model's decision-making process, allowing clinicians to understand which regions of the MRI scans contribute to the classification outcomes.Discussion This research demonstrates the potential of combining advanced deep learning techniques with explainability to improve diagnostic accuracy and trust in AI applications within healthcare.

AB  - BackgroundDespite the recognition that developing artificial intelligence (AI) that is trustworthy is necessary for public acceptability and the successful implementation of AI in healthcare contexts, perspectives from key stakeholders are often absent from discourse on the ethical design, development, and deployment of AI. This study explores the perspectives of birth parents and mothers on the introduction of AI-based cardiotocography (CTG) in the context of intrapartum care, focusing on issues pertaining to trust and trustworthiness.MethodsSeventeen semi-structured interviews were conducted with birth parents and mothers based on a speculative case study. Interviewees were based in England and were pregnant and/or had given birth in the last two years. Thematic analysis was used to analyze transcribed interviews with the use of NVivo. Major recurring themes acted as the basis for identifying the values most important to this population group for evaluating the trustworthiness of AI.ResultsThree themes pertaining to the perceived trustworthiness of AI emerged from interviews: (1) trustworthy AI-developing institutions, (2) trustworthy data from which AI is built, and (3) trustworthy decisions made with the assistance of AI. We found that birth parents and mothers trusted public institutions over private companies to develop AI, that they evaluated the trustworthiness of data by how representative it is of all population groups, and that they perceived trustworthy decisions as being mediated by humans even when supported by AI.ConclusionsThe ethical values that underscore birth parents and mothers' perceptions of trustworthy AI include fairness and reliability, as well as practices like patient-centered care, the promotion of publicly funded healthcare, holistic care, and personalized medicine. Ultimately, these are also the ethical values that people want to protect in the healthcare system. Therefore, trustworthy AI is best understood not as a list of design features but in relation to how it undermines or promotes the ethical values that matter most to its end users. An ethical commitment to these values when creating AI in healthcare contexts opens up new challenges and possibilities for the design and deployment of AI.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence can provide quite accurate predictions for critical applications (e.g., healthcare), but lacks the ability to explain its internal mechanism in most applications which require high interaction with humans. Even if many studies analyze machine learning models and their learning behavior and eventually provide an interpretation of the inner mechanics of these models, these studies often entail a simpler surrogate model, which generates explanations by producing a piece of interpretable information such as feature scores. The crucial caveat against these studies is the lack of human involvement in the design and evaluation of explanations, consequently giving rise to trust issues and lack of acceptance and understanding. To this end, we address this limitation by involving humans in the counterfactual explanation generation process which is enriched with user feedback, thus enhancing the automated explanations which are better aligned with user expectations. In this paper, we propose a user feedback based counterfactual explanation approach (FCE) for explainable Artificial Intelligence. In our work, we utilize feedback in two ways: first, to customize the explanations by providing the acceptable ranges in the feature space where to look for feasible counterfactuals, and second, to evaluate the generated explanations.

AB  - Introduction The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning technologies into healthcare, particularly for enhancing mental health diagnostics, represents a critical frontier in advancing patient care. Key challenges within this domain include data scarcity, model interpretability, robustness under domain shifts, and trustworthy decision-making-issues pivotal to the context of mental health and cognitive neuroscience.Methods We propose a novel deep learning framework, MedIntelligenceNet, enhanced with Clinical-Informed Adaptation. MedIntelligenceNet integrates multi-modal data fusion, probabilistic uncertainty quantification, hierarchical feature abstraction, and adversarial domain adaptation into a unified model architecture. The Clinical-Informed Adaptation strategy employs structured clinical priors, symbolic reasoning, and domain alignment techniques to address interpretability and robustness concerns in healthcare AI.Results Empirical evaluations conducted on multi-modal mental health datasets demonstrate that our framework achieves notable improvements in diagnostic accuracy, model calibration, and resilience to domain shifts, surpassing baseline deep learning methods.Discussion These results underscore the effectiveness of integrating clinical knowledge with advanced AI techniques. Our approach aligns with broader goals in healthcare AI: fostering more personalized, transparent, and reliable diagnostic systems for mental health. Ultimately, it supports the development of diagnostic tools that generalize better, quantify uncertainty more reliably, and align more closely with clinical reasoning.

AB  - When it comes to complex machine learning models, commonly referred to as black boxes, understanding the underlying decision making process is crucial for domains such as healthcare and financial services, as well as when they are used in connection with safety critical systems such as autonomous vehicles. As a result, interest in explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) tools and techniques has increased in recent years. However, the user experience (UX) effectiveness of existing xAI frameworks, especially concerning algorithms that work with data as opposed to images, is still an open research question. In order to address this gap, we examine the UX effectiveness of the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) xAI framework, one of the most popular model agnostic frameworks found in the literature, with a specific focus on its performance in terms of making tabular models more interpretable. In particular, we apply several state of the art machine learning algorithms on a tabular dataset, and demonstrate how LIME can be used to supplement conventional performance assessment methods. Based on this experience, we evaluate the understandability of the output produced by LIME both via a usability study, involving participants who are not familiar with LIME, and its overall usability via a custom made assessment framework, called Model Usability Evaluation (MUsE), which is derived from the International Organisation for Standardisation 9241-11:2018 standard.

AB  - Purpose: This review aims to comprehensively explore the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to an area that has not been traditionally explored in depth: the continuum of maternal-fetal health. In doing so, the intent was to examine this physiologically continuous spectrum of mother and child health, as well as to highlight potential pitfalls, and suggest solutions for the same. Method: A systematic search identified studies employing AI techniques for prediction, diagnosis, and decision support employing various modalities like imaging, electrophysiological signals and electronic health records in the domain of obstetrics and fetal health. In the selected articles then, AI applications in fetal morphology, gestational age assessment, congenital defect detection, fetal monitoring, placental analysis, and maternal physiological monitoring were critically examined both from the perspective of the domain and artificial intelligence. Result: AI-driven solutions demonstrate promising capabilities in medical diagnostics and risk prediction, offering automation, improved accuracy, and the potential for personalized medicine. However, challenges regarding data availability, algorithmic transparency, and ethical considerations must be overcome to ensure responsible and effective clinical implementation. These challenges must be urgently addressed to ensure a domain as critical to public health as obstetrics and fetal health, is able to fully benefit from the gigantic strides made in the field of artificial intelligence. Conclusion: Open access to relevant datasets is crucial for equitable progress in this critical public health domain. Integrating responsible and explainable AI, while addressing ethical considerations, is essential to maximize the public health benefits of AI-driven solutions in maternal-fetal care.

AB  - Proactively predicting antidepressant treatment response before medication failures is crucial, as it reduces unsuccessful attempts and facilitates the development of personalized therapeutic strategies, ultimately enhancing treatment efficacy. The current decision-making process, which heavily depends on subjective indicators, underscores the need for an objective, indicator-based approach. This study developed a method for detecting depression and predicting treatment response through deep learning-based spectroscopic analysis of extracellular vesicles (EVs) from plasma. EVs were isolated from the plasma of both nondepressed and depressed groups, followed by Raman signal acquisition, which was used for AI algorithm development. The algorithm successfully distinguished depression patients from healthy individuals and those with panic disorder, achieving an AUC accuracy of 0.95. This demonstrates the model's capability to selectively diagnose depression within a nondepressed group, including those with other mental health disorders. Furthermore, the algorithm identified depression-diagnosed patients likely to respond to antidepressants, classifying responders and nonresponders with an AUC accuracy of 0.91. To establish a diagnostic foundation, the algorithm applied explainable AI (XAI), enabling personalized medicine for companion diagnostics and highlighting its potential for the development of liquid biopsy-based mental disorder diagnosis.

AB  - PurposeWe present a machine learning-based online recommendation system for stroke risk assessments. With this tool, users will be able to take proactive steps in managing their health by predicting stroke risk based on diverse data input, providing transparent and reliable risk factor interpretations, and helping healthcare professionals make informed clinical decisions.MethodsThis study uses the publicly available Stroke Analysis dataset. To predict stroke risk, the CatBoost classifier is employed, while the XAI component incorporates SHAP explainer to provide insights into its reasoning. A Django-based web application allows users to upload risk factor data and receive personalized stroke risk predictions. Smartwatch integration allows continuous monitoring of dynamic risk factors. BioMistral 7B Large Language Models (LLM) is employed to create an intuitive AI medical assistant.ResultsThe developed automated online recommender system is highly accurate and robust for stroke risk assessment. The CatBoost classifier shows an average AUC of 0.98. In addition to the SHAP explainer, the recommender system also integrates Google Maps, Alert System, and Q/A chatbot based on LLMs.ConclusionAccording to the study, AI-driven systems can assist in stroke risk assessment and preventive care strategies. Developing a user-friendly online recommender system provides proof of principle for an efficient and user-friendly health management tool using machine learning, explainable AI, and LLM.

AB  - Here the authors develop a method for accurate auto-labelling of CXR images from large public datasets based on quantitative probability-of similarity to an explainable AI model. The labels can be used to fine-tune the original model through iterative re-training.
   The inability to accurately, efficiently label large, open-access medical imaging datasets limits the widespread implementation of artificial intelligence models in healthcare. There have been few attempts, however, to automate the annotation of such public databases; one approach, for example, focused on labor-intensive, manual labeling of subsets of these datasets to be used to train new models. In this study, we describe a method for standardized, automated labeling based on similarity to a previously validated, explainable AI (xAI) model-derived-atlas, for which the user can specify a quantitative threshold for a desired level of accuracy (the probability-of-similarity, pSim metric). We show that our xAI model, by calculating the pSim values for each clinical output label based on comparison to its training-set derived reference atlas, can automatically label the external datasets to a user-selected, high level of accuracy, equaling or exceeding that of human experts. We additionally show that, by fine-tuning the original model using the automatically labelled exams for retraining, performance can be preserved or improved, resulting in a highly accurate, more generalized model.

AB  - Our title alludes to the three Christmas ghosts encountered by Ebenezer Scrooge in A Christmas Carol, who guide Ebenezer through the past, present, and future of Christmas holiday events. Similarly, our article takes readers through a journey of the past, present, and future of medical AI. In doing so, we focus on the crux of modern machine learning: the reliance on powerful but intrinsically opaque models. When applied to the healthcare domain, these models fail to meet the needs for transparency that their clinician and patient end-users require. We review the implications of this failure, and argue that opaque models (1) lack quality assurance, (2) fail to elicit trust, and (3) restrict physician-patient dialogue. We then discuss how upholding transparency in all aspects of model design and model validation can help ensure the reliability and success of medical AI.

AB  - Deep Learning models are automating many daily routine tasks, indicating that in the future, even high-risk tasks will be automated, such as healthcare and automated driving areas. However, due to the complexity of such deep learning models, it is challenging to understand their reasoning. Furthermore, the black box nature of the designed deep learning models may undermine public confidence in critical areas. Current efforts on intrinsically interpretable models focus only on classification tasks, leaving a gap in models for object detection. Therefore, this paper proposes a deep learning model that is intrinsically explainable for the object detection task. The chosen design for such a model is a combination of the well-known Faster-RCNN model with the ProtoPNet model. For the Explainable AI experiments, the chosen performance metric was the similarity score from the ProtoPNet model. Our experiments show that this combination leads to a deep learning model that is able to explain its classifications, with similarity scores, using a visual "bag of words", which are called prototypes, that are learned during the training process. Furthermore, the adoption of such an explainable method does not seem to hinder the performance of the proposed model, which achieved a mAP of 69% in the KITTI dataset and a mAP of 66% in the GRAZPEDWRI-DX dataset. Moreover, our explanations have shown a high reliability on the similarity score.

TI  - FLPneXAINet: Federated deep learning and explainable AI for improved pneumonia prediction utilizing GAN-augmented chest X-ray data
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Pneumonia, a severe lung infection caused by various viruses, presents significant challenges in diagnosis and treatment due to its similarities with other respiratory conditions. Additionally, the need to protect patient privacy complicates the sharing of sensitive clinical data. This study introduces FLPneXAINet, an effective framework that combines federated learning (FL) with deep learning (DL) and explainable AI (XAI) to securely and accurately predict pneumonia using chest X-ray (CXR) images. We utilized a benchmark dataset from Kaggle, comprising 8,402 CXR images (3,904 normal and 4,498 pneumonia). The dataset was preprocessed and augmented using a cycle-consistent generative adversarial (CycleGAN) network to increase the volume of training data. Three pre-trained DL models named VGG16, NASNetMobile, and MobileNet were employed to extract features from the augmented dataset. Further, four ensemble DL (EDL) models were used to enhance feature extraction. Feature optimization was performed using recursive feature elimination (RFE), analysis of variance (ANOVA), and random forest (RF) to select the most relevant features. These optimized features were then inputted into machine learning (ML) models, including K-nearest neighbor (KNN), naive bayes (NB), support vector machine (SVM), and RF, for pneumonia prediction. The performance of the models was evaluated in a FL environment, with the EDL network achieving the best results: accuracy 97.61%, F1 score 98.36%, recall 98.13%, and precision 98.59%. The framework's predictions were further validated using two XAI techniques-Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) and Grad-CAM. FLPneXAINet offers a robust solution for healthcare professionals to accurately diagnose pneumonia, ensuring timely treatment while safeguarding patient privacy.

AB  - This article reflects on explainability in the context of medical artificial intelligence (AI) applications, focusing on AI-based clinical decision support systems (CDSS). After introducing the concept of explainability in AI and providing a short overview of AI-based clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) and the role of explainability in CDSSs, four use cases of AI-based CDSSs will be presented. The examples were chosen to highlight different types of AI-based CDSSs as well as different types of explanations: a machine language (ML) tool that lacks explainability; an approach with post hoc explanations; a hybrid model that provides medical knowledge-based explanations; and a causal model that involves complex moral concepts. Then, the role, relevance, and implications of explainability in the context of the use cases will be discussed, focusing on seven explainability-related aspects and themes. These are: (1) The addressees of explainability in medical AI; (2) the relevance of explainability for medical decision making; (3) the type of explanation provided; (4) the (often-cited) conflict between explainability and accuracy; (5) epistemic authority and automation bias; (6) Individual preferences and values; (7) patient autonomy and doctor-patient relationships. The case-based discussion reveals that the role and relevance of explainability in AI-based CDSSs varies considerably depending on the tool and use context. While it is plausible to assume that explainability in medical AI has positive implications, empirical data on explainability and explainability-related implications is scarce. Use-case-based studies are needed to investigate not only the technical aspects of explainability but also the perspectives of clinicians and patients on the relevance of explainability and its implications.

AB  - Advances in the gene sequencing technology and the outbreak of artificial intelligence have made precision medicine a reality recently. Applying machine learning algorithms to cancer prediction using gene expression data helps to discover the link between genetic data and cancer, which will promote the development and application of precision medicine. Considering the natural order of genes, a new classification method that combines fused lasso and elastic net as regularization for linear support vector machine (SVM), which uses huberized hinge loss as the loss function, is proposed in this paper, which we name it oriented feature selection SVM (OFSSVM). Due to the characteristics of the elastic net and fused lasso, the OFSSVM can not only provide automatic feature selection, but also average the adjacent coefficients, resulting in a sparse and smooth solution. We demonstrate its effectiveness in both binary classification and multiclass classification in the sense of comprehensive evaluation that not only the classification accuracy but also the interpretability are considered. The experiments show that the OFSSVM is an appealing compromise between interpretability and classification accuracy, and is superior to other traditional methods in the sense of comprehensive evaluation.

AB  - Background Explainability is one of the most heavily debated topics when it comes to the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare. Even though AI-driven systems have been shown to outperform humans in certain analytical tasks, the lack of explainability continues to spark criticism. Yet, explainability is not a purely technological issue, instead it invokes a host of medical, legal, ethical, and societal questions that require thorough exploration. This paper provides a comprehensive assessment of the role of explainability in medical AI and makes an ethical evaluation of what explainability means for the adoption of AI-driven tools into clinical practice. Methods Taking AI-based clinical decision support systems as a case in point, we adopted a multidisciplinary approach to analyze the relevance of explainability for medical AI from the technological, legal, medical, and patient perspectives. Drawing on the findings of this conceptual analysis, we then conducted an ethical assessment using the "Principles of Biomedical Ethics" by Beauchamp and Childress (autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice) as an analytical framework to determine the need for explainability in medical AI. Results Each of the domains highlights a different set of core considerations and values that are relevant for understanding the role of explainability in clinical practice. From the technological point of view, explainability has to be considered both in terms how it can be achieved and what is beneficial from a development perspective. When looking at the legal perspective we identified informed consent, certification and approval as medical devices, and liability as core touchpoints for explainability. Both the medical and patient perspectives emphasize the importance of considering the interplay between human actors and medical AI. We conclude that omitting explainability in clinical decision support systems poses a threat to core ethical values in medicine and may have detrimental consequences for individual and public health. Conclusions To ensure that medical AI lives up to its promises, there is a need to sensitize developers, healthcare professionals, and legislators to the challenges and limitations of opaque algorithms in medical AI and to foster multidisciplinary collaboration moving forward.

AB  - Many studies have reported increased mortality risk in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), but few have investigated the risk factors for PD mortality, including medical and socioeconomic factors. We applied an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) model to predict long-term all-cause mortality in patients with PD using administrative healthcare data collected at PD diagnosis. Among seven machine learning algorithms, XGBoost achieved the best performance (10-year area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC): 0.836; 5-year AUROC: 0.894). The most important contributing feature to PD mortality was age, followed by male sex and pneumonia. Using XAI models, the nonlinear association between contributing factors and PD mortality was assessed, and an optimal target value to reduce mortality was found. In addition, prediction of individualized 10-year mortality risk for each PD participant was possible. Our XAI modeling pipeline demonstrated the feasibility to predict long-term mortality in patients with PD using preexisting healthcare data.

AB  - Efficient bed management minimizes hospital costs and improves efficiency and patient outcomes. This study presents a predictive hospital-ICU length of stay (LOS) framework at admission, where it leverages hospital EHR. Our work utilizes supervised machine learning classification models to predict ICU patients' LOS in hospital clinical information systems (CIS). Our research marks the first known instance of utilizing explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) for the purpose of explainable machine learning applied to real data collected from hospital stays. We evaluated the predictive classification models using a range of performance metrics (Accuracy, AUC, Sensitivity, Specificity, F1- score, Precision, Recall and more) to predict short and long ICU lengths of stay upon hospital admission. XGBoost predicted short and long LOS with a 98 % AUC. This study shows how hospitals and ICUs might use machine learning to forecast patients on admission. Our study extends clinical information systems for hospitals to provide robust and trustworthy LOS, predictive models by using xAI to explain predictive model outputs.

AB  - Can satisfactory explanations for complex machine learning models be achieved in high-risk automated decision-making? How can such explanations be integrated into a data protection framework safeguarding a right to explanation? This article explores from an interdisciplinary point of view the connection between existing legal requirements for the explainability of AI systems set out in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the current state of the art in the field of explainable AI. It studies the challenges of providing human legible explanations for current and future AI-based decision-making systems in practice, based on two scenarios of automated decision-making in credit scoring risks and medical diagnosis of COVID-19. These scenarios exemplify the trend towards increasingly complex machine learning algorithms in automated decision-making, both in terms of data and models. Current machine learning techniques, in particular those based on deep learning, are unable to make clear causal links between input data and final decisions. This represents a limitation for providing exact, human-legible reasons behind specific decisions, and presents a serious challenge to the provision of satisfactory, fair and transparent explanations. Therefore, the conclusion is that the quality of explanations might not be considered as an adequate safeguard for automated decision-making processes under the GDPR. Accordingly, additional tools should be considered to complement explanations. These could include algorithmic impact assessments, other forms of algorithmic justifications based on broader AI principles, and new technical developments in trustworthy AI. This suggests that eventually all of these approaches would need to be considered as a whole.

AB  - Different systems based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques are currently used in relevant areas such as healthcare, cybersecurity, natural language processing, and self-driving cars. However, many of these systems are developed with "black box" AI, which makes it difficult to explain how they work. For this reason, explainability and interpretability are key factors that need to be taken into consideration in the development of AI systems in critical areas. In addition, different contexts produce different explainability needs which must be met. Against this background, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) appears to be able to address and solve this situation. In the field of automated driving, XAI is particularly needed because the level of automation is constantly increasing according to the development of AI techniques. For this reason, the field of XAI in the context of automated driving is of particular interest. In this paper, we propose the use of an explainable intelligence technique in the understanding of some of the tasks involved in the development of advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS). Since ADAS assist drivers in driving functions, it is essential to know the reason for the decisions taken. In addition, trusted AI is the cornerstone of the confidence needed in this research area. Thus, due to the complexity and the different variables that are part of the decision-making process, this paper focuses on two specific tasks in this area: the detection of emotions and the distractions of drivers. The results obtained are promising and show the capacity of the explainable artificial techniques in the different tasks of the proposed environments.

AB  - This work presents SeizFt-a novel seizure detection framework that utilizes machine learning to automatically detect seizures using wearable SensorDot EEG data. Inspired by interpretable sleep staging, our novel approach employs a unique combination of data augmentation, meaningful feature extraction, and an ensemble of decision trees to improve resilience to variations in EEG and to increase the capacity to generalize to unseen data. Fourier Transform (FT) Surrogates were utilized to increase sample size and improve the class balance between labeled non-seizure and seizure epochs. To enhance model stability and accuracy, SeizFt utilizes an ensemble of decision trees through the CatBoost classifier to classify each second of EEG recording as seizure or non-seizure. The SeizIt1 dataset was used for training, and the SeizIt2 dataset for validation and testing. Model performance for seizure detection was evaluated using two primary metrics: sensitivity using the any-overlap method (OVLP) and False Alarm (FA) rate using epoch-based scoring (EPOCH). Notably, SeizFt placed first among an array of state-of-the-art seizure detection algorithms as part of the Seizure Detection Grand Challenge at the 2023 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP). SeizFt outperformed state-of-the-art black-box models in accurate seizure detection and minimized false alarms, obtaining a total score of 40.15, combining OVLP and EPOCH across two tasks and representing an improvement of similar to 30% from the next best approach. The interpretability of SeizFt is a key advantage, as it fosters trust and accountability among healthcare professionals. The most predictive seizure detection features extracted from SeizFt were: delta wave, interquartile range, standard deviation, total absolute power, theta wave, the ratio of delta to theta, binned entropy, Hjorth complexity, delta + theta, and Higuchi fractal dimension. In conclusion, the successful application of SeizFt to wearable SensorDot data suggests its potential for real-time, continuous monitoring to improve personalized medicine for epilepsy.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Stroke stands as a prominent global health issue, causing con-siderable mortality and debilitation. It arises when cerebral blood flow is compromised, leading to irreversible brain cell damage or death. Leveraging the power of machine learning, this paper presents a systematic approach to predict stroke patient survival based on a comprehensive set of factors. These factors include demographic attributes, medical history, lifestyle elements, and physiological metrics. Method: An effective random sampling method is proposed to handle the highly biased data of stroke. The stroke pre-diction using optimized boosting machine learning algorithms is supported with explainable AI using LIME and SHAP. This enables the models to discern intricate data patterns and establish correlations between selected features and patient survival. Results: The performance of three boosting algorithms is studied for stroke prediction, which include Gradient Boosting (GB), AdaBoost (ADB), and XGBoost (XGB) with XGB achieved the best outcome overall with a training accuracy of 96.97% and testing accuracy of 92.13%. Conclusions: Through this approach, the study seeks to uncover actionable insights to guide healthcare practitioners in devising personalized treatment strategies for stroke patients.

AB  - This study measures expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B)1 and related cytokine genes in bone marrow mononuclear cells in patients with hematological malignancies, analyzing the relationship between them with an integrated framework of statistical analyses, machine learning (ML), and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). While traditional dimensionality reduction techniques-such as principal component analysis, linear discriminant analysis, and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding-showed limited differentiation embedding, ML classifiers (k-Nearest Neighbors, Na & iuml;ve Bayes Classifier, Random Forest, and XGBoost) successfully identified critical patterns. Notably, normalized caspase-1 counts consistently emerged as the most influential feature associated with NF-kappa B1 activity across disease groups, as highlighted by SHapley Additive exPlanations analyses. Systematic evaluation of ML performance on small datasets revealed that a minimum sample size of 15-24 is necessary for reliable classification outcomes, particularly in cohorts of acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. These findings underscore the pivotal role of caspase-1 to the NF-kappa B1 gene expression in hematologic malignancy diseases. Furthermore, this study demonstrates the feasibility of leveraging ML and XAI to derive meaningful insights from limited data, offering a robust strategy for biomarker discovery and precision medicine in rare hematological malignancies.

AB  - The machine learning modeling process conventionally results in selecting a single model that maximizes a selected performance metric. However, this approach leads to abandoning a more profound analysis of slightly inferior models. Particularly in medical and healthcare studies, where the objective extends beyond predictions to generation of valuable insights, relying solely on a single model can result in misleading or incomplete conclusions. This problem is particularly pertinent when dealing with a set of models known as Rashomon set, with performance close to maximum one. Such a set can be numerous and may contain models describing the data in a different way, which calls for comprehensive analysis. This paper introduces a novel method to explore models in the Rashomon set, extending the conventional modeling approach. We propose the Rashomon_DETECT algorithm to detect models with different behavior. It is based on recent developments in the eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) field. To quantify differences in variable effects among models, we introduce the Profile Disparity Index (PDI) based on measures from functional data analysis. To illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, we showcase its application on real-world medical problem: predicting survival among hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) patients - a foundational case study. Additionally, we benchmark our approach on other medical data sets, demonstrating its versatility and utility in various contexts. If differently behaving models are detected in the Rashomon set, their combined analysis leads to more trustworthy conclusions, which is of vital importance for high-stakes applications such as medical applications.

AB  - The widespread integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into our daily lives has spurred an escalating demand for explainable AI (XAI). This demand is particularly pronounced in critical domains such as healthcare and finance, where understanding the decision-making processes of AI models is paramount. Despite noteworthy strides in XAI, prevailing approaches often neglect the crucial dimension of context, resulting in explanations that are challenging to comprehend and act upon for different stakeholders. This paper advocates for a paradigm shift towards context-sensitive explainability, tailoring explanations to users' specific needs and understanding promoting inclusivity and accessibility. We propose a novel context taxonomy and a versatile framework, "ConEX" for developing context-sensitive explanations using any state-of-the-art post hoc explainer. Our empirical user study highlights diverse preferences for contextualization levels, emphasizing the importance of catering to these preferences to build trust and satisfaction in AI systems. Our contributions extend beyond the theoretical realm, offering practical guidance for developing context-sensitive explanations that are tailored to the specific needs of diverse stakeholders. By embracing context-sensitive explainability, we can unlock the true potential of AI, fostering trust, transparency, and informed decision-making across various domains.

AB  - Objectives: Artificial intelligence (AI) symptom-checker apps are proliferating, yet their everyday usability and transparency remain under-examined. This study provides a triangulated evaluation of three widely used AI-powered mHealth apps: ADA, Mediktor, and WebMD. Methods: Five usability experts applied a 13-item AI-specific heuristic checklist. In parallel, thirty lay users (18-65 years) completed five health-scenario tasks on each app, while task success, errors, completion time, and System Usability Scale (SUS) ratings were recorded. A repeated-measures ANOVA followed by paired-sample t-tests was conducted to compare SUS scores across the three applications. Results: The analysis revealed statistically significant differences in usability across the apps. ADA achieved a significantly higher mean SUS score than both Mediktor (p = 0.0004) and WebMD (p < 0.001), while Mediktor also outperformed WebMD (p = 0.0009). Common issues across all apps included vague AI outputs, limited feedback for input errors, and inconsistent navigation. Each application also failed key explainability heuristics, offering no confidence scores or interpretable rationales for AI-generated recommendations. Conclusions: Even highly rated AI mHealth apps display critical gaps in explainability and error handling. Embedding explainable AI (XAI) cues such as confidence indicators, input validation, and transparent justifications can enhance user trust, safety, and overall adoption in real-world healthcare contexts.

AB  - Background/Objectives: This study aims to build an interpretable and accurate predictive model for myocardial infarction (MI) using Explainable Boosting Machines (EBM), a state-of-the-art Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) technique. The objective is to identify and rank clinically relevant biomarkers that contribute to MI diagnosis while maintaining transparency to support clinical decision making. Methods: The dataset comprises 1319 patient records collected in 2018 from a cardiology center in the Erbil region of Iraq. Each record includes eight routinely measured clinical and biochemical features, such as troponin, CK-MB, and glucose levels, and a binary outcome variable indicating the presence or absence of MI. After preprocessing (e.g., one-hot encoding, normalization), the EBM model was trained using 80% of the data and tested on the remaining 20%. Model performance was evaluated using standard metrics including AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and Matthews correlation coefficient. Feature importance was assessed to identify key predictors. Partial dependence analyses provided insights into how each variable affected model predictions. Results: The EBM model demonstrated excellent diagnostic performance, achieving an AUC of 0.980, an accuracy of 96.6%, sensitivity of 96.8%, and specificity of 96.2%. Troponin and CK-MB were identified as the top predictors, confirming their established clinical relevance in MI diagnosis. In contrast, demographic and hemodynamic variables such as age and blood pressure contributed minimally. Partial dependence plots revealed non-linear effects of key biomarkers. Local explanation plots demonstrated the model's ability to make confident, interpretable predictions for both positive and negative cases. Conclusions: The findings highlight the potential of EBM as a clinically useful and ethical AI approach for MI diagnosis. By combining high predictive accuracy with transparency, EBM supports biomarker prioritization and clinical risk stratification, thus aligning with precision medicine and responsible AI principles. Future research should validate the model on multi-center datasets and explore additional features for broader clinical use.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) is a major global health issue, contributing significantly to mortality and morbidity rates worldwide. Socioeconomic, environmental, and healthcare factors significantly impact TB trends. Therefore, we aimed to predict TB and identify the determinants of the disease using advanced artificial intelligence (AI). This study employed the advanced machine learning (ML) model, XGBoost (eXtreme gradient boosting), combined with XAI (eXplainable artificial intelligence) and spatial analysis to describe global TB incidence and mortality rates across 194 countries from 2000 to 2022. Spatial autocorrelation analysis utilizing Moran's I revealed geographical clusters and significant determinants affecting TB incidence. Treatment success rates and MDR-TB treatment initiation were identified as pivotal determinants of TB incidence. The correlation study revealed a substantial positive relationship between TB incidence in HIV-positive patients and overall TB incidence (r = 0.83). Confirmed cases of MDR-TB had the most significant impact on TB incidence (SHAP = 0.874). Additionally, air pollution had a notable impact on TB incidence (SHAP = 1.36). The XGBoost model demonstrated the best predictive performance for TB incidence and mortality, exhibiting the lowest RMSE (0.88), the highest R2 (0.67), and Adjusted R2 (0.65). This study highlights the potential of integrating XGBoost and XAI methodologies as a holistic framework for effectively tackling global tuberculosis incidence and mortality rates, as well as for the proficient application of advanced analytical techniques in public health.

AB  - The metabolic pathway known as gluconeogenesis, which produces glucose from non-carbohydrate substrates, is essential for maintaining balanced blood sugar levels while fasting. It's extremely important to anticipate gluconeogenesis rates accurately to recognize metabolic disorders and create efficient treatment strategies. The implementation of deep learning and machine learning methods to forecast complex biological processes has been gaining popularity in recent years. The recognition of both the regulation of the pathway and possible therapeutic applications of proteins depends on accurate identification associated with their gluconeogenesis patterns. This article analyzes the uses of machine learning and deep learning models, to predict gluconeogenesis efficiency. The study also discusses the challenges that come with restricted data availability and model interpretability, as well as possible applications in personalized healthcare, metabolic disease treatment, and the discovery of drugs. The predictor utilizes statistics moments on the structures of gluconeogenesis and their enzymes, while Random Forest is utilized as a classifier to ensure the accuracy of this model in identifying the best outcomes. The method was validated utilizing the independent test, self-consistency, 10k fold cross-validations, and jackknife test which achieved 92.33 %, 91.87%, 87.88%, and 87.02%. An accurate prediction of gluconeogenesis has significant implications for understanding metabolic disorders and developing targeted therapies. This study contributes to the rising field of predictive biology by mixing algorithms for deep learning, and machine learning, with metabolic pathways.

AB  - Over 64 million people worldwide are affected by heart failure (HF), a condition that significantly raises mortality and medical expenses. In this study, we explore the potential of retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) features as non-invasive biomarkers for the classification of heart failure subtypes: left ventricular heart failure (LVHF), congestive heart failure (CHF), and unspecified heart failure (UHF). By analyzing retinal measurements from the left eye, right eye, and both eyes, we aim to investigate the relationship between ocular indicators and heart failure using machine learning (ML) techniques. We conducted nine classification experiments to compare normal individuals against LVHF, CHF, and UHF patients, using retinal OCT features from each eye separately and in combination. Our analysis revealed that retinal thickness metrics, particularly ISOS-RPE and macular thickness in various regions, were significantly reduced in heart failure patients. Logistic regression, CatBoost, and XGBoost models demonstrated robust performance, with notable accuracy and area under the curve (AUC) scores, especially in classifying CHF and UHF. Feature importance analysis highlighted key retinal parameters, such as inner segment-outer segment to retinal pigment epithelium (ISOS-RPE) and inner nuclear layer to the external limiting membrane (INL-ELM) thickness, as crucial indicators for heart failure detection. The integration of explainable artificial intelligence further enhanced model interpretability, shedding light on the biological mechanisms linking retinal changes to heart failure pathology. Our findings suggest that retinal OCT features, particularly when derived from both eyes, have significant potential as non-invasive tools for early detection and classification of heart failure. These insights may aid in developing wearable, portable diagnostic systems, providing scalable solutions for personalized healthcare, and improving clinical outcomes for heart failure patients.

AB  - Background & Objective : Liver disease remains a significant global health burden, often progressing silently until advanced stages such as cirrhosis or hepatic failure. Early detection is essential but remains hindered by the limitations of conventional diagnostics. This study presents LivXAI-Net, an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework integrated with Internet of Things (IoT) biosensors, designed and evaluated in a simulated real-time setting using a historical dataset. Methods: LivXAI-Net simulates continuous data acquisition from wearable biosensors - including sweat, platelet, and prothrombin sensors - and processes this data using machine learning (ML) models trained on the Mayo Clinic primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) dataset (n = 424, 1974-1984). Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost(XGB) classifiers were deployed with SHAP and Permutation Feature Importance (PFI) to enhance interpretability. A mobile application, Hepatic Health Tracker, delivers real-time risk predictions, supported by a secure data pipeline using TLS 1.3 and AES-256 encryption. Results: RF and XGB achieved accuracies of 84% and 82% respectively under 20-fold cross-validation. Key biomarkers - albumin, cholesterol, and triglycerides - were consistently identified by SHAP as influential in classification. The system achieved a total latency of 0.85 s in a simulated 5G environment, supporting near-instantaneous alert delivery via the mobile interface. Conclusion: LivXAI-Net combines interpretable ML with real-time biosensor data to enable proactive liver disease management. While currently validated using historical data in a simulated environment, future work will involve deployment with live sensor input and clinical trials to validate utility and generalizability in real-world settings.

AB  - Pregnancy termination remains a complex and sensitive issue with approximately 45% of abortions worldwide being unsafe, and 97% of abortions occurring in developing countries. Unsafe pregnancy terminations have implications for women's reproductive health. This research aims to compare black box models in their prediction of pregnancy termination among reproductive-aged women and identify factors associated with pregnancy termination using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods. We used comprehensive secondary data on reproductive-aged women's demographic and socioeconomic data from the Demographic Health Survey (DHS) from six countries in East Africa in the analysis. This study implemented five black box ML models, Bagging classifier, Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) Classifier, CatBoost Classifier, and Extra Trees Classifier on a dataset with 338,904 instances and 18 features. Additionally, SHAP, Eli5, and LIME XAI techniques were used to determine features associated with pregnancy termination and Statistical analysis were employed to understand the distribution of pregnancy termination. The results demonstrated that machine learning algorithms were able to predict pregnancy termination on DHS data with an overall accuracy ranging from 79.4 to 85.6%. The ML classifier random forest achieved the highest result, with an accuracy of 85.6%. Based on the results of the XAI tool, the most contributing factors for pregnancy termination are wealth index, current working experience, and source of drinking water, sex of household, education level, and marital status. The outcomes of this study using random forest is expected to significantly contribute to the field of reproductive healthcare in East Africa and can assist healthcare providers in identifying individuals' countries at greater risk of pregnancy termination, allowing for targeted interventions and support.

AB  - The development of deep learning algorithms has transformed medical image analysis, especially in brain tumor recognition. This research introduces a robust automatic microbrain tumor identification method utilizing the VGG16 deep learning model. Microscopy magnetic resonance imaging (MMRI) scans extract detailed features, providing multi-modal insights. VGG16, known for its depth and high performance, is utilized for this purpose. The study demonstrates the model's potential for precise and effective diagnosis by examining how well it can differentiate between areas of normal brain tissue and cancerous regions, leveraging both MRI and microscopy data. We describe in full the pre-processing actions taken to improve the quality of input data and maximize model efficiency. A carefully selected dataset, incorporating diverse tumor sizes and types from both microscopy and MRI sources, is used during the training phase to ensure representativeness. The proposed modified VGG19 model achieved 98.81% validation accuracy. Despite good accuracy, interpretation of the result still questionable.

AB  - Background and Objectives: AI has emerged as a transformative force in clinical medicine, changing the diagnosis, treatment, and management of patients. Tools have been derived for working with ML, DL, and NLP algorithms to analyze large complex medical datasets with unprecedented accuracy and speed, thereby improving diagnostic precision, treatment personalization, and patient care outcomes. For example, CNNs have dramatically improved the accuracy of medical imaging diagnoses, and NLP algorithms have greatly helped extract insights from unstructured data, including EHRs. However, there are still numerous challenges that face AI integration into clinical workflows, including data privacy, algorithmic bias, ethical dilemmas, and problems with the interpretability of "black-box" AI models. These barriers have thus far prevented the widespread application of AI in health care, and its possible trends, obstacles, and future implications are necessary to be systematically explored. The purpose of this paper is, therefore, to assess the current trends in AI applications in clinical medicine, identify those obstacles that are hindering adoption, and identify possible future directions. This research hopes to synthesize evidence from other peer-reviewed articles to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the role that AI plays to advance clinical practices, improve patient outcomes, or enhance decision-making. Methods: A systematic review was done according to the PRISMA guidelines to explore the integration of Artificial Intelligence in clinical medicine, including trends, challenges, and future directions. PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were searched for peer-reviewed articles from 2014 to 2024 with keywords such as "Artificial Intelligence in Medicine," "AI in Clinical Practice," "Machine Learning in Healthcare," and "Ethical Implications of AI in Medicine." Studies focusing on AI application in diagnostics, treatment planning, and patient care reporting measurable clinical outcomes were included. Non-clinical AI applications and articles published before 2014 were excluded. Selected studies were screened for relevance, and then their quality was critically appraised to synthesize data reliably and rigorously. Results: This systematic review includes the findings of 8 studies that pointed out the transformational role of AI in clinical medicine. AI tools, such as CNNs, had diagnostic accuracy more than the traditional methods, particularly in radiology and pathology. Predictive models efficiently supported risk stratification, early disease detection, and personalized medicine. Despite these improvements, significant hurdles, including data privacy, algorithmic bias, and resistance from clinicians regarding the "black-box" nature of AI, had yet to be surmounted. XAI has emerged as an attractive solution that offers the promise to enhance interpretability and trust. As a whole, AI appeared promising in enhancing diagnostics, treatment personalization, and clinical workflows by dealing with systemic inefficiencies. Conclusion: The transformation potential of AI in clinical medicine can transform diagnostics, treatment strategies, and efficiency. Overcoming obstacles such as concerns about data privacy, the danger of algorithmic bias, and difficulties with interpretability may pave the way for broader use and facilitate improvement in patient outcomes while transforming clinical workflows to bring sustainability into healthcare delivery.

AB  - Limitations in computer-assisted diagnosis include lack of labeled data and inability to model the relation between what experts see and what computers learn. Even though artificial intelligence and machine learning have demonstrated remarkable performances in medical image computing, their accountability and transparency level must be improved to transfer this success into clinical practice. The reliability of machine learning decisions must be explained and interpreted, especially for supporting the medical diagnosis. While deep learning techniques are broad so that unseen information might help learn patterns of interest, human insights to describe objects of interest help in decision-making. This paper proposes a novel approach, DeepCraftFuse, to address the challenge of combining information provided by deep networks with visual-based features to significantly enhance the correct identification of cancerous tissues in patients affected with Barrett's esophagus (BE). We demonstrate that DeepCraftFuse outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on private and public datasets, reaching results of around 95% when distinguishing patients affected by BE that is either positive or negative to esophageal cancer.

AB  - Multi-disease conditions strain the body's defenses, complicating recovery and increasing mortality risk. Therefore, effective concurrent prevention of multiple diseases is essential for mitigating complications and improving overall well-being. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) with an advanced multimodal large language model (LLM) can create an interactive system enabling the general public to engage in natural language without any specialized knowledge prerequisites. Counterfactual explanation, an XAI method, offers valuable insights by suggesting adjustments to patient features to minimize disease risks. However, addressing multiple diseases simultaneously poses challenging barriers. This article proposes an interactive multi-disease prevention system that uses Google Gemini Pro, a multimodal LLM, and a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm, namely NSGA-II, to overcome such problems. This system recommends changes in feature values to concurrently minimize the risk of diseases such as heart attacks and diabetes. The system facilitates personalized feature value selection, significantly reducing disease attack probabilities to as low as possible. Such an approach holds the potential to simultaneously address the unresolved issue of preventing and managing multiple diseases for the general public.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to propose a novel hybrid framework for evaluating and benchmarking trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) applications in healthcare by using multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques under a new fuzzy environment. To develop such a framework, a new decision matrix has been built, and then integrated with q-ROF2TL-FWZIC (q-Rung Orthopair Fuzzy 2-Tuple Linguistic Fuzzy-Weighted Zero-Inconsistency) and q-ROF2TL-CODAS (q-Rung Orthopair Fuzzy 2-Tuple Linguistic Combinative Distance-Based Assessment). In this integration, q-ROF2TL-FWZIC is utilized for assigning the weights of evaluation attributes of trustworthy AI, while q-ROF2TL-CODAS is employed for benchmarking trustworthy AI applications. Findings show that the q-ROF2TL-FWZIC method effectively weights the evaluation attributes. The transparency attribute receives the highest importance weight (0.173566825), whereas the human agency and oversight criterion has the lowest weight (0.105741901). The remaining attributes are distributed in between. Moreover, alternative_4 receives the highest rank order (score of 7.370410417), while alternative_13 receives the lowest rank order (score of -4.759794397). To evaluate the validity of the proposed framework, systematic ranking and sensitivity analysis assessments were employed.

AB  - Skin diseases impact millions of people around the world and pose a severe risk to public health. These diseases have a wide range of effects on the skin's structure, functionality, and appearance. Identifying and predicting skin diseases are laborious processes that require a complete physical examination, a review of the patient's medical history, and proper laboratory diagnostic testing. Additionally, it necessitates a significant number of histological and clinical characteristics for examination and subsequent treatment. As a disease's complexity and quantity of features grow, identifying and predicting it becomes more challenging. This research proposes a deep learning (DL) model utilizing transfer learning (TL) to quickly identify skin diseases like chickenpox, measles, and monkeypox. A pre-trained VGG16 is used for transfer learning. The VGG16 can identify and predict diseases more quickly by learning symptom patterns. Images of the skin from the four classes of chickenpox, measles, monkeypox, and normal are included in the dataset. The dataset is separated into training and testing. The experimental results performed on the dataset demonstrate that the VGG16 model can identify and predict skin diseases with 93.29% testing accuracy. However, the VGG16 model does not explain why and how the system operates because deep learning models are black boxes. Deep learning models' opacity stands in the way of their widespread application in the healthcare sector. In order to make this a valuable system for the health sector, this article employs layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) to determine the relevance scores of each input. The identified symptoms provide valuable insights that could support timely diagnosis and treatment decisions for skin diseases.

AB  - Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Predicting and detecting heart disease early is crucial, as it allows medical professionals to take appropriate and necessary actions at earlier stages. Healthcare professionals can diagnose cardiac conditions more accurately by applying machine learning technology. This study aimed to enhance heart disease prediction using stacking and voting ensemble methods. Fifteen base models were trained on two different heart disease datasets. After evaluating various combinations, six base models were pipelined to develop ensemble models employing a meta-model (stacking) and a majority vote (voting). The performance of the stacking and voting models was compared to that of the individual base models. To ensure the robustness of the performance evaluation, we conducted a statistical analysis using the Friedman aligned ranks test and Holm post-hoc pairwise comparisons. The results indicated that the developed ensemble models, particularly stacking, consistently outperformed the other models, achieving higher accuracy and improved predictive outcomes. This rigorous statistical validation emphasised the reliability of the proposed methods. Furthermore, we incorporated explainable AI (XAI) through SHAP analysis to interpret the model predictions, providing transparency and insight into how individual features influence heart disease prediction. These findings suggest that combining the predictions of multiple models through stacking or voting may enhance the performance of heart disease prediction and serve as a valuable tool in clinical decision-making.

AB  - The major contributor to global mortality is cardiovascular disease, posing a formidable challenge to the global healthcare system. Heart disease often develops and progresses without noticeable symptoms, emphasizing the need for earlier detection to prevent severe outcomes. AI models provide tools for accurate diagnosis, data analysis, and predictive diagnosis of people who may be suffering from heart disease. But increasingly, solutions like Explainable AI (XAI) are gaining traction. XAI demystifies the decisions of AI models, making them transparent and understandable to the point where they boost confidence in the context of AI diagnostics by healthcare professionals; the AI then provides support to professionals to decide the best course of action for each patient based on the analysis. XAI techniques such as SHAP, LIME, QLattice and Anchor are popular, and have been used in this study. We analysed a heart disease dataset collected from a multispecialty hospital in India, which is publicly available on Mendeley. We used ML models, including RF, Logistic Regression, KNN, XGBoost, DT and SVM. These models were optimized and stack-ensembled to form the 'CARDIACX' model to predict the risk of heart disease. The models were fine-tuned using Grid Search, Random Search, and Bayesian Optimization methods, achieving promising results with Random Forest achieving an AUC =0.99 and accuracy of 98.5%, outperforming all the other models and demonstrating robust performance on various metrics such as AUC, PR Curve, Log Loss, Jaccard Score, and MCC. This study provides a reliable and transparent framework for early detection of heart disease, providing useful information and enabling patients to receive timely and personalized care.

AB  - Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) brought light on the need for explainability in multiple domains (e.g., healthcare, finance, justice, and recruiting). Explainability or Explainable AI (XAI) can be defined as everything that makes AI more understandable to human beings. However, XAI features may vary according to the AI algorithm used. Beyond XAI features, different AI algorithms vary in terms of speed, performance, and costs associated with training/running models. Knowing when to choose the right algorithm for the task at hand, therefore, is fundamental in multiple AI systems, for instance, AutoML and AutoAI. In this paper, we propose a method to analyze patterns of high-granularity user interface (UI) events (i.e., mouse, keyboard, and additional custom events triggered on the millisecond scale) to predict when users will interact with UI elements that provide explainability for the AI in place. In this context, this paper presents: (1) a user study involving 37 participants (7 in the pilot phase and 30 in the main experiment phase) in which people performed a task of reporting a bug using a text form associated with an AI data quality meter and its XAI UI element and (2) an approach to model micro behavior using node2uec to predict when the interaction with XAI UI element will occur. The proposed approach uses a rich dataset (approximately 129k events) and combines node2uec and a Logistic Regression classifier. Results obtained show we have obtained an event-by-event prediction of the interaction with XAI with an average F-score of 0.90 (cr = 0.06). From the presented results, one expects to support researchers in the realm of UI personalization to consider high-granularity interaction data when predicting the need for XAI while users are interacting with AI model outputs.

AB  - Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques generate explanations for predictions from AI models. These explanations can be evaluated for (i) faithfulness to the prediction, i.e., its correctness about the reasons for prediction, and (ii) usefulness to the user. While there are metrics to evaluate faithfulness, to our knowledge, there are no automated metrics to evaluate the usefulness of explanations in the clinical context. Our objective is to develop a new metric to evaluate usefulness of AI explanations to clinicians. Usefulness evaluation needs to consider both (a) how humans generally process explanations and (b) clinicians' specific requirements from explanations presented by clinical decision support systems (CDSS). Our new scoring method can evaluate the usefulness of explanations generated by any XAI method that provides importance values for the input features of the prediction model. Our method draws on theories from social science to gauge usefulness, and uses literature-derived biomedical knowledge graphs to quantify support for the explanations from clinical literature. We evaluate our method in a case study on predicting onset of sepsis in intensive care units. Our analysis shows that the scores obtained using our method corroborate with independent evidence from clinical literature and have the required qualities expected from such a metric. Thus, our method can be used to evaluate and select useful explanations from a diverse set of XAI techniques in clinical contexts, making it a fundamental tool for future research in the design of AI-driven CDSS.

KW  - cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)
KW  - eXplainable artificial intelligence
KW  - risk prediction
AB  - The global prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) as a leading cause of death highlights the imperative need for refined risk assessment and prognostication methods. The traditional approaches, including the Framingham Risk Score, blood tests, imaging techniques, and clinical assessments, although widely utilized, are hindered by limitations such as a lack of precision, the reliance on static risk variables, and the inability to adapt to new patient data, thereby necessitating the exploration of alternative strategies. In response, this study introduces CardioRiskNet, a hybrid AI-based model designed to transcend these limitations. The proposed CardioRiskNet consists of seven parts: data preprocessing, feature selection and encoding, eXplainable AI (XAI) integration, active learning, attention mechanisms, risk prediction and prognosis, evaluation and validation, and deployment and integration. At first, the patient data are preprocessed by cleaning the data, handling the missing values, applying a normalization process, and extracting the features. Next, the most informative features are selected and the categorical variables are converted into a numerical form. Distinctively, CardioRiskNet employs active learning to iteratively select informative samples, enhancing its learning efficacy, while its attention mechanism dynamically focuses on the relevant features for precise risk prediction. Additionally, the integration of XAI facilitates interpretability and transparency in the decision-making processes. According to the experimental results, CardioRiskNet demonstrates superior performance in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-Score, with values of 98.7%, 98.7%, 99%, and 98.7%, respectively. These findings show that CardioRiskNet can accurately assess and prognosticate the CVD risk, demonstrating the power of active learning and AI to surpass the conventional methods. Thus, CardioRiskNet's novel approach and high performance advance the management of CVDs and provide healthcare professionals a powerful tool for patient care.

AB  - Background: This paper explores the perception and application of artificial intelligence (AI) for personalized medicine within the trans community, an often-overlooked demographic in the broader scope of precision medicine. Despite growing advancements in AI-driven health care solutions, little research has been dedicated to understanding how these technologies can be tailored to meet the unique health care needs of trans individuals. Addressing this gap is crucial for ensuring that precision medicine is genuinely inclusive and effective for all populations. Objective: This study aimed to identify the specific challenges, obstacles, and potential solutions associated with the deployment of AI technologies in the development of personalized medicine for trans people. This research emphasizes a trans-inclusive and multidisciplinary perspective, highlighting the importance of cultural competence and community engagement in the design and implementation of AI-driven health care solutions. Methods: A communicative methodology was applied in this study, prioritizing the active involvement of end-users and stakeholders through egalitarian dialogue that recognizes and values cultural intelligence. The methodological design included iterative consultations with trans community representatives to cocreate the research workflow and adapt data collection instruments accordingly. This participatory approach ensured that the perspectives and lived experiences of trans individuals were integral to the research process. Data collection was conducted through 3 focus groups with 16 trans adults, aimed at discussing the challenges, risks, and transformative potential of AI in precision medicine. Results: Analysis of the focus group discussions revealed several critical barriers impacting the integration of AI in personalized medicine for trans people, including concerns around data privacy, biases in algorithmic decision-making, and the lack of tailored health care data reflective of trans experiences. Participants expressed apprehensions about potential misdiagnoses or inappropriate treatments due to cisnormative data models. However, they also identified opportunities for AIto enhance health care outcomes, advocating for community-led data collection initiatives and improved algorithmic transparency. Proposed solutions included enhancing datasets with trans-specific health markers, incorporating community voices in AI development processes, and prioritizing ethical frameworks that respect gender diversity. Conclusions: This study underscores the necessity for a trans-inclusive approach to precision medicine, facilitated by AI technologies that are sensitive to the health care needs and lived realities of trans people. By addressing the identified challenges and adopting community-driven solutions, AI has the potential to bridge existing health care gaps and improve the quality of life for trans individuals. This research contributes to the growing discourse on equitable health care innovation, calling for more inclusive AI design practices that extend the benefits of precision medicine to marginalized communities.

AB  - Application of machine and deep learning methods in drug discovery and cancer research has gained a considerable amount of attention in the past years. As the field grows, it becomes crucial to systematically evaluate the performance of novel computational solutions in relation to established techniques. To this end, we compare rule-based and data-driven molecular representations in prediction of drug combination sensitivity and drug synergy scores using standardized results of 14 high-throughput screening studies, comprising 64 200 unique combinations of 4153 molecules tested in 112 cancer cell lines. We evaluate the clustering performance of molecular representations and quantify their similarity by adapting the Centered Kernel Alignment metric. Our work demonstrates that to identify an optimal molecular representation type, it is necessary to supplement quantitative benchmark results with qualitative considerations, such as model interpretability and robustness, which may vary between and throughout preclinical drug development projects.

AB  - Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL), also known as Kala-Azar, poses a significant global public health challenge and is a neglected disease, with relapses and treatment failures leading to increased morbidity and mortality. This study introduces an explainable machine learning approach to predict VL relapse and identify critical risk factors, thereby aiding patient monitoring and treatment strategies. Leveraging data from a follow-up study of 571 patients, the survival machine learning models are applied, including Random Survival Forest (RSF), Survival Support Vector Machine (SSVM), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), for relapse prediction. The results demonstrated that RSF, with a C-index of 0.85, outperformed the conventional Cox Proportional Hazard (CPH) model (C-index 0.8), offering improved prediction capabilities by capturing non-linear relationships and variable interactions. To address the lack of transparency (in terms of feature importance) in Machine Learning (ML) models, the SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) method is employed, which enhances model interpretability (feature importance) through visual insights. SHAP dependence plots allowed the healthcare professionals to evaluate which factors encourage the occurrence of the relapse. A statistically significant relationship between HIV co-infection (HR=3.92, 95% CI=2.03-7.58) and VL relapse was identified through -2 log-likelihood ratio and chi-square tests. These results indicate the promise of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for making clinical decisions and remedying recurrences in VL.

AB  - Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare are driving research into solutions that can provide personalized guidance. For these solutions to be used as clinical decision support tools, the results provided must be interpretable and consistent with medical knowledge. To this end, this study explores the use of explainable AI to characterize the risk of developing cardiovascular disease in patients diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. A dataset of 9613 records from patients diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was classified into three categories of cardiovascular risk (low, moderate, and high), as estimated by the Framingham Risk Score. Counterfactual explanations were generated with two different methods, MUlti Counterfactuals via Halton sampling (MUCH) and Diverse Counterfactual Explanation (DiCE). An error control mechanism is introduced in the preliminary classification phase to reduce classification errors and obtain meaningful and representative explanations. Furthermore, the concept of counterfactual conformity is introduced as a new way to validate single counterfactual explanations in terms of their conformity, based on proximity with respect to the factual observation and plausibility. The results indicate that explanations generated with MUCH are generally more plausible (lower implausibility) and more distinguishable (higher discriminative power) from the original class than those generated with DiCE, whereas DiCE shows better availability, proximity and sparsity. Furthermore, filtering the counterfactual explanations by eliminating the non-conformal ones results in an additional improvement in quality. The results of this study suggest that combining counterfactual explanations generation with conformity evaluation is worth further validation and expert assessment to enable future development of support tools that provide personalized recommendations for reducing individual risk by targeting specific subsets of biomarkers.

AB  - Recent developments in big data technologies are revolutionizing the field of healthcare predictive analytics (HPA), enabling researchers to explore challenging problems using complex prediction models. Nevertheless, healthcare practitioners are reluctant to adopt those models as they are less transparent and accountable due to their black-box structure. We believe that instance-level, or local, explanations enhance patient safety and foster trust by enabling patient-level interpretations and medical knowledge discovery. Therefore, we propose the RObust Local EXplanations (ROLEX) method to develop robust, instance-level explanations for HPA models in this study. ROLEX adapts state-of-the-art methods and ameliorates their shortcomings in explaining individual-level predictions made by black-box machine learning models. Our analysis with a large real-world dataset related to a prevalent medical condition called fragility fracture and two publicly available healthcare datasets reveals that ROLEX outperforms widely accepted benchmark methods in terms of local faithfulness of explanations. In addition, ROLEX is more robust since it does not rely on extensive hyperparameter tuning or heuristic algorithms. Explanations generated by ROLEX, along with the prototype user interface presented in this study, have the potential to promote personalized care and precision medicine by providing patient-level interpretations and novel insights. We discuss the theoretical implications of our study in healthcare, big data, and design science.

AB  - Virtual reality (VR) and immersive technology have emerged as powerful tools with numerous applications. VR technology creates a computer-generated simulation that immerses users in a virtual environment, providing a highly realistic and interactive experience. This technology finds applications in various fields, including gaming, healthcare, education, architecture, and training simulations. Understanding user immersion levels in VR is crucial and challenging for optimizing the design of VR applications. Immersion refers to the extent to which users feel absorbed and engrossed in the virtual environment. This research primarily aims to detect user immersion levels in VR using an efficient machine-learning model. We utilized a benchmark dataset based on user experiences in VR environments to conduct our experiments. Advanced deep and machine learning approaches are applied in comparison. We proposed a novel technique called Polynomial Random Forest (PRF) for feature generation mechanisms. The proposed PRF approach extracts polynomial and class prediction probability features to generate a new feature set. Extensive research experiments show that random forest outperformed state-of-the-art approaches, achieving a high immersion level detection rate of 98%, using the proposed PRF technique. We applied hyperparameter optimization and cross-validation approaches to validate the performance scores. Additionally, we utilized explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to interpret the reasoning behind the decisions made by the proposed model for user immersion level detection in VR. Our research has the potential to revolutionize user immersion level detection in VR, enhancing the design process.

AB  - Recent advances in the science and technology of artificial intelligence (AI) and growing numbers of deployed AI systems in healthcare and other services have called attention to the need for ethical principles and governance. We define and provide a rationale for principles that should guide the commission, creation, implementation, maintenance, and retirement of AI systems as a foundation for governance throughout the lifecycle. Some principles are derived from the familiar requirements of practice and research in medicine and healthcare: beneficence, nonmaleficence, autonomy, and justice come first. A set of principles follow from the creation and engineering of AI systems: explainability of the technology in plain terms; interpretability, that is, plausible reasoning for decisions; fairness and absence of bias; dependability, including "safe failure"; provision of an audit trail for decisions; and active management of the knowledge base to remain up to date and sensitive to any changes in the environment. In organizational terms, the principles require benevolence-aiming to do good through the use of AI; transparency, ensuring that all assumptions and potential conflicts of interest are declared; and accountability, including active oversight of AI systems and management of any risks that may arise. Particular attention is drawn to the case of vulnerable populations, where extreme care must be exercised. Finally, the principles emphasize the need for user education at all levels of engagement with AI and for continuing research into AI and its biomedical and healthcare applications.

AB  - This study addresses the critical challenge of detecting brain tumors using MRI images, a pivotal task in medical diagnostics that demands high accuracy and interpretability. While deep learning has shown remarkable success in medical image analysis, there remains a substantial need for models that are not only accurate but also interpretable to healthcare professionals. The existing methodologies, predominantly deep learning-based, often act as black boxes, providing little insight into their decision-making process. This research introduces an integrated approach using ResNet50, a deep learning model, combined with Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to offer a transparent and explainable framework for brain tumor detection. We employed a dataset of MRI images, enhanced through data augmentation, to train and validate our model. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in model performance, with a testing accuracy of 98.52% and precision-recall metrics exceeding 98%, showcasing the model's effectiveness in distinguishing tumor presence. The application of Grad-CAM provides insightful visual explanations, illustrating the model's focus areas in making predictions. This fusion of high accuracy and explainability holds profound implications for medical diagnostics, offering a pathway towards more reliable and interpretable brain tumor detection tools.

KW  - DECISIONS
AB  - We argue why interpretability should have primacy alongside empiricism for several reasons: first, if machine learning (ML) models are beginning to render some of the high-risk healthcare decisions instead of clinicians, these models pose a novel medicolegal and ethical frontier that is incompletely addressed by current methods of appraising medical interventions like pharmacological therapies; second, a number of judicial precedents underpinning medical liability and negligence are compromised when 'autonomous' ML recommendations are considered to be en par with human instruction in specific contexts; third, explainable algorithms may be more amenable to the ascertainment and minimisation of biases, with repercussions for racial equity as well as scientific reproducibility and generalisability. We conclude with some reasons for the ineludible importance of interpretability, such as the establishment of trust, in overcoming perhaps the most difficult challenge ML will face in a high-stakes environment like healthcare: professional and public acceptance.

AB  - As society experiences accelerated ageing, understanding the complex biological processes of human ageing, which are affected by a large number of variables and factors, becomes increasingly crucial. Artificial intelligence (AI) presents a promising avenue for ageing research, offering the ability to detect patterns, make accurate predictions, and extract valuable insights from large volumes of complex, heterogeneous data. As ageing research increasingly leverages AI techniques, we present a timely systematic literature review to explore the current state-of-the-art in this field following a rigorous and transparent review methodology. As a result, a total of 77 articles have been identified, summarised, and categorised based on their characteristics. AI techniques, such as machine learning and deep learning, have been extensively used to analyse diverse datasets, comprising imaging, genetic, behavioural, and contextual data. Findings showcase the potential of AI in predicting age-related outcomes, developing ageing biomarkers, and determining factors associated with healthy ageing. However, challenges related to data quality, interpretability of AI models, and privacy and ethical considerations have also been identified. Despite the advancements, novel approaches suggest that there is still room for improvement to provide personalised AI-driven healthcare services and promote active ageing initiatives with the ultimate goal of enhancing the quality of life and well-being of older adults.Graphical abstractOverview of the literature review.

AB  - Accurately predicting patients' risk for specific medical outcomes is paramount for effective healthcare management and personalized medicine. While a substantial body of literature addresses the prediction of diverse medical conditions, existing models predominantly focus on singular outcomes, limiting their scope to one disease at a time. However, clinical reality often entails patients concurrently facing multiple health risks across various medical domains. In response to this gap, our study proposes a novel multi-risk framework adept at simultaneous risk prediction for multiple clinical outcomes, including diabetes, mortality, and hypertension. Leveraging a concise set of features extracted from patients' cardiorespiratory fitness data, our framework minimizes computational complexity while maximizing predictive accuracy. Moreover, we integrate a state-of-the-art instance-based interpretability technique into our framework, providing users with comprehensive explanations for each prediction. These explanations afford medical practitioners invaluable insights into the primary health factors influencing individual predictions, fostering greater trust and utility in the underlying prediction models. Our approach thus stands to significantly enhance healthcare decision-making processes, facilitating more targeted interventions and improving patient outcomes in clinical practice. Our prediction framework utilizes an automated machine learning framework, Auto-Weka, to optimize machine learning models and hyper-parameter configurations for the simultaneous prediction of three medical outcomes: diabetes, mortality, and hypertension. Additionally, we employ a local interpretability technique to elucidate predictions generated by our framework. These explanations manifest visually, highlighting key attributes contributing to each instance's prediction for enhanced interpretability. Using automated machine learning techniques, the models simultaneously predict hypertension, mortality, and diabetes risks, utilizing only nine patient features. They achieved an average AUC of 0.90 +/- 0.001 on the hypertension dataset, 0.90 +/- 0.002 on the mortality dataset, and 0.89 +/- 0.001 on the diabetes dataset through tenfold cross-validation. Additionally, the models demonstrated strong performance with an average AUC of 0.89 +/- 0.001 on the hypertension dataset, 0.90 +/- 0.001 on the mortality dataset, and 0.89 +/- 0.001 on the diabetes dataset using bootstrap evaluation with 1000 resamples.

AB  - The diagnosis of cancer are crucial medical responsibilities that assist medical practitioners correctly classify and treat them accordingly. Machine learning applications are widely used in medical field as they identify patterns from clinical data. Traditional machine learning approaches often struggle with accurately identifying malignancies due to the complexity and variability of medical data. This study aims to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of cancer detection models by integrating LightGBM with SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) within a federated learning framework. The innovation of this research lies in the combination of LightGBM's ability in handling high dimensional feature of large data size with SHAP's detailed interpretability metrics. This integration not only facilitates accurate cancer detection but also provides insights into the contributing factors of the model's predictions, making it easier for healthcare professionals to trust and utilize these models. The federated learning approach allows multiple institutions to collaborate in training the model without sharing raw patient data, ensuring data privacy while benefiting from diverse datasets. The integrated framework achieved a remarkable accuracy of 98.3% in cancer detection, with precision, recall, and F1 scores of 97.8%, 97.2%, and 95%, respectively. These results indicate that the proposed method effectively identifies cancer cases while maintaining high interpretability, allowing for better decision-making in clinical settings. The integration of LightGBM with SHAP within a federated learning framework provides a powerful and effective solution for cancer detection.

AB  - The use of artificial intelligence in geriatrics is very promising and relevant, as the diagnosis of a geriatric patient is a complex, experience-based, and time-consuming process that involves a variety of questionnaires and subjective and inaccurate patient responses. This paper proposes the explainable artificial intelligence-based (XAI) clinical decision support system (CDSS) to assess nutrition-related factors (symptoms) and to determine the likelihood of geriatric patient health risks associated with four syndromes: malnutrition, oropharyngeal dysphagia, dehydration, and eating disorders in dementia. The proposed system's prototype was tested under real conditions at the geriatric department of Lithuanian University of Health Sciences Kaunas Hospital. The subjects of this study were 83 geriatric patients with various health conditions. The assessments of the nutritional status and syndromes of the patients provided by the CDSS were compared with the diagnoses of the physicians obtained using standard assessment methods. The results show that proposed CDSS can efficiently diagnose nutrition-related geriatric syndromes with high accuracy: 87.95% for malnutrition, 87.95% for oropharyngeal dysphagia, 90.36% for eating disorders in dementia, and 86.75% for dehydration. The research confirms that the proposed XAI-based CDSS is an effective tool, able to assess nutrition-related health risk factors and their dependencies and, in some cases, makes even a more accurate decision than a less experienced physician.

AB  - To avoid irreversible vision loss, early detection and diagnosis of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) severity is critical. The percentage of people undertaking eye examinations has risen in recent years, increasing the burden on Ophthalmologists. Various Artificial Intelligence (AI) screening systems have recently been deployed to improve the accuracy of DR diagnosis. However, owing to their black-box nature, most successful AI screening systems are still held back in reality for medical decision aid. The need for an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) screening system to help Ophthalmologists in DR diagnosis is inevitable. The proposed work is divided into three phases: (i) pre-processing, (ii) optic disk localization, and (iii) DR severity classification. On top of the deep learning model, the proposed work implements a Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) explainer to describe what features of the retinal image took part in justifying the predictions. The proposed framework outputs a pixel-value tensor, explaining the possible pixel values contributing to the model's prediction. MESSIDOR data collection is used for experimental analysis. When compared with other deep learning models, the proposed framework achieved a better accuracy of 98.04%, sensitivity of 99.69%, specificity of 96.37%, f1-score of 96.99% and error rate of 3.60%. Incorporating explainable deep learning models for diabetic retinopathy severity grading improves diagnostic accuracy and provides clinicians with clear insights, enabling trust and informed decision-making in DR diagnosis. This proposed technique enormously advances more effective and responsible healthcare procedures.

Hence, the role of artificial intelligence comes into play to provide the medical practitioner assistance in making diagnosis and prognosis. In order to be adopted as a clinical decision support system, interpretable or explainable model is important for healthcare professionals to trust the results. This study assessed various popular machine learning models under two multimodal fusion architectures to find the best combination in terms of both predictive performance and interpretability. Methods: Two architectures, early and late, also known as feature-and decision-level fusion were chosen for multinomial classification task. On top of the commonly used simple concatenation, this study employed weighted and hybrid weighted concatenation to fuse features within and across modalities under the two fusion structures. To test the efficacy of each model pipeline, the assessment was done according to their distinct foundations on which the models were built and each of their advantages was recognized. Classification metrics were unified and visualized into a pentagon to compare the overall performance of each pipeline. In addition, interpretability analysis was provided to quantify the importance of each modality and feature recognized by each model. Results: The potential characteristics of each type of pipelines in terms of prediction accuracy and ability to capture the relevant markers of each cognitive state were uncovered. In this particular healthcare application, the tree-based and linear models were the top 2 choices. Coupled with early and late fusion structure with weighted concatenation, reaching the balanced accuracy of 0.920 and 0.912, consecutively. The top 5 most important features revealed belong to Cognitive Test Scores and Neuropsychological Battery of Test modalities. Conclusion: This work contributes as medical applications of artificial intelligence evaluation to aid practitioners in understanding the capability of different fusion architectures with different classifiers in getting to know the use of machine learning in clinical setting. With accurate classification, early detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease can be achieved.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) has significantly influenced areas such as healthcare, agriculture, industrial systems, and smart infrastructure. However, the rapid increase in the number of connected devices has introduced major security concerns, especially the risk of Distributed Denial of Service attacks. These attacks take advantage of the limited processing power and weak security configurations of many IoT devices, leading to network disruptions and service failures. This study presents an efficient intrusion detection approach that combines Binary Bat Algorithm (BBAT) based feature selection with an ensemble of lightweight machine learning models, including Extra Trees, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost. The BBAT algorithm helps reduce the number of features while preserving classification accuracy, thereby lowering computational cost. To handle class imbalance, we incorporate the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique, improving detection of underrepresented attack types. For interpretability, we apply Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) to identify key features that influence classification outcomes, supporting transparency and operational trust. The method is evaluated using three benchmark datasets-ToN-IoT, NSL-KDD, and UNSW-NB15 achieved high accuracy of 99.99%, 99.37%, and 99.08%, respectively. Comparative analysis with existing methods confirms the robustness, efficiency, and explainability of the proposed detection approach.

AB  - Background: Healthcare-associated infection (HAI) remains a significant risk for hospitalized patients and a challenging burden for the healthcare system. This study presents a clinical decision support tool that can be used in clinical workflows to proactively engage secondary assessments of pre-symptomatic and at-risk infection patients, thereby enabling earlier diagnosis and treatment.Methods: This study applies machine learning, specifically ensemble-based boosted decision trees, on large retrospective hospital datasets to develop an infection risk score that predicts infection before obvious symptoms present. We extracted a stratified machine learning dataset of 36,782 healthcare-associated infection patients. The model leveraged vital signs, laboratory measurements and demographics to predict HAI before clinical suspicion, defined as the order of a microbiology test or administration of antibiotics.Results: Our best performing infection risk model achieves a cross-validated AUC of 0.88 at 1 h before clinical suspicion and maintains an AUC >0.85 for 48 h before suspicion by aggregating information across demographics and a set of 163 vital signs and laboratory measurements. A second model trained on a reduced feature space comprising demographics and the 36 most frequently measured vital signs and laboratory measurements can still achieve an AUC of 0.86 at 1 h before clinical suspicion. These results compare favorably against using temperature alone and clinical rules such as the quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA) score. Along with the performance results, we also provide an analysis of model interpretability via feature importance rankings.Conclusion: The predictive model aggregates information from multiple physiological parameters such as vital signs and laboratory measurements to provide a continuous risk score of infection that can be deployed in hospitals to provide advance warning of patient deterioration.

KW  - explainable AI
AB  - Background/Objectives: Predicting patient readmission is an important task for healthcare risk management, as it can help prevent adverse events, reduce costs, and improve patient outcomes. In this paper, we compare various conventional machine learning models and deep learning models on a multimodal dataset of electronic discharge records from an Irish acute hospital. Methods: We evaluate the effectiveness of several widely used machine learning models that leverage patient demographics, historical hospitalization records, and clinical diagnosis codes to forecast future clinical risks. Our work focuses on addressing two key challenges in the medical fields, data imbalance and the variety of data types, in order to boost the performance of machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, we also employ SHapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) value visualization to interpret the model predictions and identify both the key data features and disease codes associated with readmission risks, identifying a specific set of diagnosis codes that are significant predictors of readmission within 30 days. Results: Through extensive benchmarking and the application of a variety of feature engineering techniques, we successfully improved the area under the curve (AUROC) score from 0.628 to 0.7 across our models on the test dataset. We also revealed that specific diagnoses, including cancer, COPD, and certain social factors, are significant predictors of 30-day readmission risk. Conversely, bacterial carrier status appeared to have minimal impact due to lower case frequencies. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates how we effectively utilize routinely collected hospital data to forecast patient readmission through the use of conventional machine learning while applying explainable AI techniques to explore the correlation between data features and patient readmission rate.

AB  - Purpose:: This study aims to enhance personalized medical assessments and the early detection of knee-related pathologies by examining the relationship between knee morphology and demographic factors such as age, gender, and body mass index. Additionally, gender-specific reference values for knee morphological features will be determined using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Methods:: A retrospective analysis was conducted on the MRI data of 500 healthy knees aged 20-40 years. The study included various knee morphological features such as Distal Femoral Width (DFW), Lateral Femoral Condyler Width (LFCW), Intercondylar Femoral Width (IFW), Anterior Cruciate Ligament Width (ACLW), and Anterior Cruciate Ligament Length (ACLL). Machine learning models, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, Light Gradient Boosting, Multilayer Perceptron, and Support Vector Machines, were employed to predict gender based on these features. The SHapley Additive exPlanation was used to analyze feature importance. Results:: The learning models demonstrated high classification performance, with 83.2% (+/- 5.15) for classification of clusters based on morphological feature and 88.06% (+/- 4.8) for gender classification. These results validated that the strong correlation between knee morphology and gender. Conclusion:: The study found that DFW is the most significant feature for gender prediction, with values below 78-79 mm range indicating females and values above this range indicating males. LFCW, IFW, ACLW, and ACLL also showed significant gender-based differences. The findings establish gender-specific reference values for knee morphological features, highlighting the impact of gender on knee morphology. These reference values can improve the accuracy of diagnoses and treatment plans tailored to each gender, enhancing personalized medical care. (c) 2025 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Mobile health applications (mHealth) have revolutionized healthcare sector by leveraging mobile technology to provide personalized services. As a rapidly growing industry, mHealth aligns with the World Health Organization's goal of empowering patients to take control of their healthcare journey. In the realm of mHealth, ensuring user satisfaction always remains a key concern. Therefore, recognizing crucial factors that determine customer satisfaction levels can help mHealth applications improve their quality of service. Leveraging machine learning techniques for this task can prove to be highly beneficial. However, the existing machine learning methods in this domain are 'black-box' and possess several limitations, such as less accuracy, lack of explainability, and many more. To resolve these challenges, the current research introduces a novel approach based on deep transformers and explainable artificial intelligence (EAI). This approach aims to analyze user-generated content to determine mHealth ratings and the factors influencing user satisfaction. The proposed pipeline encompasses several steps, namely, data preprocessing and anonymization, feature extraction, feature selection, transformer architecture building, and evaluating performance using a dataset containing reviews of several different mHealth applications. The sensitivity analysis of the proposed approach is performed by utilizing several feature selection techniques and comparing the prediction performance with existing benchmark solutions available in the literature. From the comparative evaluation, it is observed that the proposed approach outperforms existing techniques by providing 98% accuracy and 99% F1-score, with a 3-5% relative improvement over benchmark solutions. In addition, the proposed method incorporates EAI to determine several crucial factors that affect user satisfaction or app rating scores. This information will be beneficial for the stakeholders in devising better platforms and strategies for enhancing user satisfaction and experience in the mHealth domain.

AB  - Background: The field of Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis is undergoing significant transformation due to the application of deep learning (DL) models. While DL surpasses traditional machine learning in disease prediction from structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), the lack of explainability limits clinical adoption. Counterfactual inference offers a way to integrate causal explanations into these models, enhancing their robustness and transparency. New method: This study develops a novel methodology combining U-Net and generative adversarial network (GAN) models to create comprehensive counterfactual diagnostic maps for AD. The proposed methodology uses case-based counterfactual reasoning for robust decision classification for counterfactual maps to understand how changes in specific features affect the model's predictions. Comparison with existing methods: The proposed methodology is compared with state-of-the-art visual explanation techniques across the ADNI dataset. The proposed methodology is also benchmarked against other gradientbased and generative models for its ability to generate comprehensive counterfactual maps. Results: The results demonstrate that the proposed methodology significantly outperforms existing methods in accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity while providing detailed counterfactual maps that visualize how slight changes in brain morphology could lead to different diagnostic outcomes. The proposed methodology achieves an accuracy of 95 % and an AUC of 0.97, illustrating its superiority in capturing subtle yet crucial anatomical features. Conclusions: By generating intuitive visual explanations, the proposed methodology improves the interpretability and robustness of AD diagnostic models, making them more reliable and accountable. The use of counterfactual inference enhances clinicians' understanding of disease progression and the impact of different interventions, fostering precision medicine in AD care.

AB  - Deep learning (DL) has transformed medical imaging, particularly in the realm of Oral Cancer (OC) diagnosis using histopathological images. Timely detection of OC is essential for enhancing precision medicine and saving lives. However, incorrect diagnosis may impede effective treatment. In this study, we have proposed a DL model for OC classification, enhanced diagnosis decision-making, and interpretability. We achieve this by starting with color normalization of histopathology images using the Vahadane Three-Stain Parameter Normalization and watershed segmentation method, followed by tiling and augmentation. Key features are selected using the Weighted Fisher Score (WFS) to address class imbalance. The U-Net classifier has been improved by using feature-based inputs instead of full images, reducing computational complexity and training time. The integration of Vahadane normalization for consistent preprocessing across samples, WFS, and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) addresses critical challenges in histopathological image analysis. The proposed model surpasses existing approaches with a classification accuracy of 99.54% and outperforms DenseNet201 and VGG10 in precision and reliability. The efficiency in handling imbalanced datasets and explainability features make it suitable for early precise OC detection, which can reduce diagnostic errors and enhance treatment outcomes.

AB  - Objectives Fairness concerns stemming from known and unknown biases in healthcare practices have raised questions about the trustworthiness of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS). Studies have shown unforeseen performance disparities in subpopulations when applied to clinical settings different from training. Existing unfairness mitigation strategies often struggle with scalability and accessibility, while their pursuit of group-level prediction performance parity does not effectively translate into fairness at the point of care. This study introduces FairICP, a flexible and cost-effective post-implementation framework based on Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP), to provide users with actionable knowledge of model uncertainty due to subpopulation level biases at the point of care.Materials and Methods FairICP applies ICP to identify the model's scope of competence through group specific calibration, ensuring equitable prediction reliability by filtering predictions that fall within the trusted competence boundaries. We evaluated FairICP against four benchmarks on three medical imaging modalities: (1) Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), (2) Chest X-ray and (3) Dermatology Imaging, acquired from both private and large public datasets. Frameworks are assessed on prediction performance enhancement and unfairness mitigation capabilities.Results Compared to the baseline, FairICP improved prediction accuracy by 7.2% and reduced the accuracy gap between the privileged and unprivileged subpopulations by 2.2% on average across all three datasets.Discussion and Conclusion Our work provides a robust solution to promote trust and transparency in AI-CDSS, fostering equality and equity in healthcare for diverse patient populations. Such post-process methods are critical to enabling a robust framework for AI-CDSS implementation and monitoring for healthcare settings.

AB  - Limited interpretability and understanding of machine learning methods in healthcare hinder their clinical impact. Imrie et al. discuss five types of machine learning interpretability. They examine medical stakeholders, highlight how interpretability meets their needs and emphasize the role of tailored interpretability in linking machine learning advancements to clinical impact.
   Applications of machine learning are becoming increasingly common in medicine and healthcare, enabling more accurate predictive models. However, this often comes at the cost of interpretability, limiting the clinical impact of machine learning methods. To realize the potential of machine learning in healthcare, it is critical to understand such models from the perspective of multiple stakeholders and various angles, necessitating different types of explanation. In this Perspective, we explore five fundamentally different types of post-hoc machine learning interpretability. We highlight the different types of information that they provide, and describe when each can be useful. We examine the various stakeholders in healthcare, delving into their specific objectives, requirements and goals. We discuss how current notions of interpretability can help meet these and what is required for each stakeholder to make machine learning models clinically impactful. Finally, to facilitate adoption, we release an open-source interpretability library containing implementations of the different types of interpretability, including tools for visualizing and exploring the explanations.

AB  - Background and Objective: Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in immunocompromised patients with hematologic malignancies (HM) is crucial to reduce the severity of COVID-19. Despite vaccination efforts, over a third of HM patients remain unresponsive, increasing their risk of severe breakthrough infections. This study aims to leverage machine learning's adaptability to COVID-19 dynamics, efficiently selecting patient-specific features to enhance predictions and improve healthcare strategies. Highlighting the complex COVID-hematology connection, the focus is on interpretable machine learning to provide valuable insights to clinicians and biologists. Methods: The study evaluated a dataset with 1166 patients with hematological diseases. The output was the achievement or non-achievement of a serological response after full COVID-19 vaccination. Various machine learning methods were applied, with the best model selected based on metrics such as the Area Under the Curve (AUC), Sensitivity, Specificity, and Matthew Correlation Coefficient (MCC). Individual SHAP values were obtained for the best model, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to these values. The patient profiles were then analyzed within identified clusters. Results: Support vector machine (SVM) emerged as the best-performing model. PCA applied to SVM-derived SHAP values resulted in four perfectly separated clusters. These clusters are characterized by the proportion of patients that generate antibodies (PPGA). Cluster 1, with the second-highest PPGA (69.91%), included patients with aggressive diseases and factors contributing to increased immunodeficiency. Cluster 2 had the lowest PPGA (33.3%), but the small sample size limited conclusive findings. Cluster 3, representing the majority of the population, exhibited a high rate of antibody generation (84.39%) and a better prognosis compared to cluster 1. Cluster 4, with a PPGA of 66.33%, included patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma on corticosteroid therapy. Conclusions: The methodology successfully identified four separate patient clusters using Machine Learning and Explainable AI (XAI). We then analyzed each cluster based on the percentage of HM patients who generated antibodies after COVID-19 vaccination. The study suggests the methodology's potential applicability to other diseases, highlighting the importance of interpretable ML in healthcare research and decision-making.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) has seamlessly integrated into numerous scientific domains, catalysing unparalleled enhancements across a broad spectrum of tasks; however, its integrity and trustworthiness have emerged as notable concerns. The scientific community has focused on the development of trustworthy AI algorithms; however, machine learning and deep learning algorithms, popular in the AI community today, intrinsically rely on the quality of their training data. These algorithms are designed to detect patterns within the data, thereby learning the intended behavioural objectives. Any inadequacy in the data has the potential to translate directly into algorithms. In this study we discuss the importance of responsible machine learning datasets through the lens of fairness, privacy and regulatory compliance, and present a large audit of computer vision datasets. Despite the ubiquity of fairness and privacy challenges across diverse data domains, current regulatory frameworks primarily address human-centric data concerns. We therefore focus our discussion on biometric and healthcare datasets, although the principles we outline are broadly applicable across various domains. The audit is conducted through evaluation of the proposed responsible rubric. After surveying over 100 datasets, our detailed analysis of 60 distinct datasets highlights a universal susceptibility to fairness, privacy and regulatory compliance issues. This finding emphasizes the urgent need for revising dataset creation methodologies within the scientific community, especially in light of global advancements in data protection legislation. We assert that our study is critically relevant in the contemporary AI context, offering insights and recommendations that are both timely and essential for the ongoing evolution of AI technologies.
   There are pervasive concerns related to fairness, privacy and regulatory compliance in machine learning applications in healthcare, necessitating a reevaluation of dataset creation practices. Mittal et al. examine various computer vision datasets, providing insights to foster responsible AI development.

AB  - The spreading of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods in different and critical application domains, like medicine and healthcare, introduces many opportunities but raises risks and opens ethical issues, mainly attaining to the lack of transparency. This contribution deals with the lack of transparency of ML and DL models focusing on the lack of trust in predictions and decisions generated. In this sense, this paper establishes a measure, namely Congruity, to provide information about the reliability of ML/DL model results. Congruity is defined by the lattice extracted through the formal concept analysis built on the training data. It measures how much the incoming data items are close to the ones used at the training stage of the ML and DL models. The general idea is that the reliability of trained model results is highly correlated with the similarity of input data and the training set. The objective of the paper is to demonstrate the correlation between the Congruity and the well-known Accuracy of the whole ML/DL model. Experimental results reveal that the value of correlation between Congruity and Accuracy of ML model is greater than 80% by varying ML models.

AB  - The advancement of deep learning in human activity recognition (HAR) using 3D skeleton data is critical for applications in healthcare, security, sports, and human-computer interaction. This paper tackles a well-known gap in the field, which is the lack of testing in the applicability and reliability of XAI evaluation metrics in the skeleton-based HAR domain. We have tested established XAI metrics, namely faithfulness and stability on Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to address this problem. This study introduces a perturbation method that produces variations within the error tolerance of motion sensor tracking, ensuring the resultant skeletal data points remain within the plausible output range of human movement as captured by the tracking device. We used the NTU RGB+D 60 dataset and the EfficientGCN architecture for HAR model training and testing. The evaluation involved systematically perturbing the 3D skeleton data by applying controlled displacements at different magnitudes to assess the impact on XAI metric performance across multiple action classes. Our findings reveal that faithfulness may not consistently serve as a reliable metric across all classes for the EfficientGCN model, indicating its limited applicability in certain contexts. In contrast, stability proves to be a more robust metric, showing dependability across different perturbation magnitudes. Additionally, CAM and Grad-CAM yielded almost identical explanations, leading to closely similar metric outcomes. This suggests a need for the exploration of additional metrics and the application of more diverse XAI methods to broaden the understanding and effectiveness of XAI in skeleton-based HAR.

KW  - Clinical decision support systems
AB  - The common black box nature of machine learning models is an obstacle to their application in health care context. Their widespread application is limited by a significant "lack of trust." So, the main goal of this work is the development of an evaluation approach that can assess, simultaneously, trust and performance. Trust assessment is based on (i) model robustness (stability assessment), (ii) confidence (95% CI of geometric mean), and (iii) interpretability (comparison of respective features ranking with clinical evidence). Performance is assessed through geometric mean. For validation, in patients' stratification in cardiovascular risk assessment, a Portuguese dataset (N=1544) was applied. Five different models were compared: (i) GRACE score, the most common risk assessment tool in Portugal for patients with acute coronary syndrome; (ii) logistic regression; (iii) Naive Bayes; (iv) decision trees; and (v) rule-based approach, previously developed by this team. The obtained results confirm that the simultaneous assessment of trust and performance can be successfully implemented. The rule-based approach seems to have potential for clinical application. It provides a high level of trust in the respective operation while outperformed the GRACE model's performance, enhancing the required physicians' acceptance. This may increase the possibility to effectively aid the clinical decision.

AB  - High glucose levels during pregnancy cause Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM). The risks include cesarean deliveries, long-term type 2 diabetes, fetal macrosomia, and infant respiratory distress syndrome. These risks highlight the need for accurate GDM prediction. This research proposes a novel fusion model for early GDM prediction. It uses conventional Machine Learning (ML) and advanced Deep Learning (DL) algorithms. Subsequently, it combines the strengths of both ML and DL algorithms using various ensemble techniques. It incorporates a meta-classifier that further reinforces its robust prediction performance. The dataset is split into training and testing sets in a 70/30 ratio. The initial steps involve exploratory analysis and data preprocessing techniques such as iterative imputation and feature engineering. Subsequently, oversampling is applied to the training set to address class imbalance which ensures the model learns effectively. The testing set remains imbalanced to maintain the credibility of the model's performance evaluation. The fusion model achieves an accuracy of 98.21%, precision of 97.72%, specificity of 98.64%, recall of 97.47%, F1 score of 97.59%, and an Accuracy Under the Curve (AUC) of 99.91%. The model exhibits efficiency with an average processing time of 0.06 s to predict GDM. These results outperform the previous studies using the same GDM prediction dataset and demonstrate the model's superior performance. Additionally, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques are utilized to interpret the model's decisions. They highlight the most influential features in GDM prediction and ensures transparency. The proposed fusion model can facilitate proactive GDM prediction to elevate GDM management and maternal-fetal health outcomes.

AB  - Colorectal cancer remains a major health concern, with colorectal polyps as key precursors. Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is a common treatment, but recurrence rates remain high. Traditional surveillance strategies rely on polyp characteristics and completeness of the resection potentially missing key risk factors. Machine learning (ML) offers a transformative approach by integrating patient-specific data to refine risk stratification. Recent studies highlight ML models, such as Extreme Gradient Boosting, which outperform conventional methods in predicting polyp recurrence within one-year post-EMR. These models incorporate factors like age, smoking status, family history, and pathology, optimizing follow-up recommendations and minimizing unnecessary procedures. Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven tools and web-based calculators enhance clinical workflow by providing real-time, personalized risk assessments. However, challenges remain in external validation, model interpretability, and clinical integration. Future surveillance strategies should combine expert judgment with AI insights to optimize patient outcomes. As gastroenterology embraces AI, ML-driven surveillance represents a paradigm shift, advancing precision medicine in colorectal polyp management. This editorial explores AI's role in transforming post-EMR follow-up, addressing benefits, limitations, and future directions.

AB  - In this paper, we study human-AI collaboration protocols, a design-oriented construct aimed at establishing and evaluating how humans and AI can collaborate in cognitive tasks. We applied this construct in two user studies involving 12 specialist radiologists (the knee MRI study) and 44 ECG readers of varying expertise (the ECG study), who evaluated 240 and 20 cases, respectively, in different collaboration configurations. We confirm the utility of AI support but find that XAI can be associated with a "white-box paradox", producing a null or detrimental effect. We also find that the order of presentation matters: AI-first protocols are associated with higher diagnostic accuracy than human-first protocols, and with higher accuracy than both humans and AI alone. Our findings identify the best conditions for AI to augment human diagnostic skills, rather than trigger dysfunctional responses and cognitive biases that can undermine decision effectiveness.

AB  - Interest in explainable machine learning has grown, particularly in healthcare, where transparency and trust are essential. We developed a semi-automated evaluation framework within a clinical decision support system (CDSS-EQCM) that integrates LIME and SHAP explanations with multi-criteria decision-making (TOPSIS and Borda count) to rank model interpretability. After two-phase preprocessing of 2934 COVID-19 patient records spanning four epidemic waves, we applied five classifiers (Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, k-NN, SVM). Five infectious disease physicians used a Streamlit interface to generate patient-specific explanations and rate models on accuracy, separability, stability, response time, understandability, and user experience. Random Forest combined with SHAP consistently achieved the highest rankings in Borda count. Clinicians reported reduced evaluation time, enhanced explanation clarity, and increased confidence in model outputs. These results demonstrate that CDSS-EQCM can effectively streamline interpretability assessment and support clinician decision-making in medical diagnostics. Future work will focus on deeper electronic medical record integration and interactive parameter tuning to further enhance real-time diagnostic support.

AB  - Time-to-event prediction, e.g. cancer survival analysis or hospital length of stay, is a highly prominent machine learning task in medical and healthcare applications. However, only a few interpretable machine learning methods comply with its challenges. To facilitate a comprehensive explanatory analysis of survival models, we formally introduce time-dependent feature effects and global feature importance explanations. We show how post-hoc interpretation methods allow for finding biases in AI systems predicting length of stay using a novel multi-modal dataset created from 1235 X-ray images with textual radiology reports annotated by human experts. Moreover, we evaluate cancer survival models beyond predictive performance to include the importance of multi-omics feature groups based on a large-scale benchmark comprising 11 datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Model developers can use the proposed methods to debug and improve machine learning algorithms, while physicians can discover disease biomarkers and assess their significance. We contribute open data and code resources to facilitate future work in the emerging research direction of explainable survival analysis.

AB  - Heart disease presents significant challenges to healthcare systems globally, being the primary cause of death and disability. Timely and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective disease management and prevention. However, traditional medical approaches often face issues like misdiagnoses and treatment delays, leading to higher costs and health complications for patients. Machine learning (ML) algorithms offer promising solutions by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and reducing errors. There is a growing interest in utilizing ML in healthcare, with ML methods playing a crucial role in analyzing medical data and assisting healthcare decisions despite facing challenges inaccurate identification. In this study, we propose a novel approach to enhance heart disease detection using a stacked ensemble model integrating various ML techniques. Initially, we address data quality by identifying and removing outliers. Then, three feature selection methods (Pearson, Chi-Square Test, and Recursive Feature Elimination) are applied to improve model performance. The resulting stacked classifier model exhibits superior accuracy (93.3%), precision (91.9%), and F1 score (93.9%), demonstrating significant improvements over raw data. Additionally, we employ Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) values for interpretability, providing insights into feature importance. This study aims to advance heart disease diagnosis and contribute to better patient outcomes by integrating quantitative metrics and concise descriptions of the proposed solution.

AB  - Background: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is increasingly vital in healthcare, where clinicians need to understand and trust AI-generated recommendations. However, the impact of AI model explanations on clinical decision-making remains insufficiently explored. Objectives: To evaluate how AI model explanations influence clinicians' mental models, trust, and satisfaction regarding machine learning-based predictions of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Length of Stay (LOS). Methods: This retrospective mixed-methods study analyzed electronic health record data from 8,579 patients admitted to a surgical ICU in South Korea between 2019 and 2022. Seven machine learning models were developed and evaluated to predict ICU LOS at 2-hour intervals during the initial 12 hours post-admission. The Random Forest (RF) model in the 10-to 12-hour window, with an AUROC of 0.903, was selected for explanation using SHapley Additive exPlanations. Fifteen ICU clinicians assessed four distinct types of explanations ('Why', 'Why not', 'How to', and 'What if') via web-based experiments, surveys, and interviews. Results: Clinicians' feature selections aligned more closely with the RF model after explanations, as demonstrated by an increase in Spearman correlation from-0.147 (p = 0.275) to 0.868 (p < 0.001). The average trust score improved from 2.8 to 3.9. The average satisfaction scores for the 'Why', 'Why not', 'How to', and 'What if' explanations were 3.3, 3.8, 3.6, and 4.1, respectively. Conclusion: AI model explanations notably enhanced clinicians' understanding and trust in AI-generated ICU LOS predictions, although complete alignment with their mental models was not achieved. Further refinement of AI model explanations is needed to support better clinician-AI collaboration and its integration into clinical practice.

AB  - Machine learning (ML) models have proven their potential in acquiring and analyzing large amounts of data to help solve real-world, complex problems. Their use in healthcare is expected to help physicians make diagnoses, prognoses, treatment decisions, and disease outcome predictions. However, ML solutions are not currently deployed in most healthcare systems. One of the main reasons for this is the provenance, transparency, and clinical utility of the training data. Physicians reject ML solutions if they are not at least based on accurate data and do not clearly include the decision-making process used in clinical practice. In this paper, we present a hybrid human-machine intelligence method to create predictive models driven by clinical practice. We promote the use of quality-approved data and the inclusion of physician reasoning in the ML process. Instead of training the ML algorithms on the given data to create predictive models (conventional method), we propose to pre-categorize the data according to the expert physicians' knowledge and experience. Comparing the results of the conventional method of ML learning versus the hybrid physician-algorithm method showed that the models based on the latter can perform better. Physicians' engagement is the most promising condition for the safe and innovative use of ML in healthcare.

AB  - With the growing convergence of artificial intelligence and daily life scenarios, the applica-tion scenarios for intelligent decision methods are becoming increasingly complex. The development of various machine learning algorithms has benefited all disciplines of study, but choosing which algorithm is most suitable for a certain problem among a large number of algorithms is a challenge that every field must overcome. Another challenge at the prac-tical application level is that machine learning algorithms currently trained with large amounts of data are primarily black-box and uninterpretable. This indicates that these methods pose potential risks and are difficult to rely on, thus hindering their application in sensitive fields such as finance and healthcare. The first challenge can be overcome by using meta-learning to combine data and prior knowledge to efficiently and automatically select the machine learning models. The second challenge remains to be addressed due to the lack of interpretability of traditional meta-learning techniques and deficiencies in transparency and fairness. Achieving the interpretability of meta-learning in autonomous algorithm selection for classification is crucial to balance the need for high accuracy and transparency of machine learning models in practical application scenarios. This paper pro-poses EFFECT, an interpretable meta-learning framework that can explain the recommen-dation results of meta-learning algorithm selection and provide a more complete and accurate explanation of the recommendation algorithm's performance on specific datasets combined with business scenarios. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the validity and correctness of this framework.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Endometrial carcinoma (EC) represents a significant clinical challenge due to its pronounced molecular heterogeneity, directly influencing prognosis and therapeutic responses. Accurate classification of molecular subtypes (CNV-high, CNV-low, MSI-H, POLE) and precise tumor mutational burden (TMB) assessment is crucial for guiding personalized therapeutic interventions. Integrating proteomics data with advanced machine learning (ML) techniques offers a promising strategy for achieving precise, clinically actionable classification and biomarker discovery in EC. Materials and Methods Using proteomic data from 95 EC patients (83 endometrioid, 12 serous), sourced from the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), we developed an ML pipeline integrating proteomic feature selection (Lasso-penalized logistic regression), classification modeling, and interpretability analysis. The dataset was divided into training (70%) and test (30%) sets, with synthetic minority oversampling (SMOTE) applied to address the class imbalance. Logistic regression models were trained for molecular subtypes classification, and the TMB prediction model performance was evaluated using accuracy, AUC, precision, recall, and F1-score. Model interpretability was enhanced using explainable AI (XAI) techniques: SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME). Results Feature selection reduced the proteomic dataset from 11,000 to eight key proteins. The proteomics-based ML model demonstrated robust predictive performance, accurately classifying EC molecular subtypes (accuracy: 82.8%; AUC: 0.990) and distinguishing high (>= 10 mutations/Mb) versus low TMB (<10 mutations/Mb) cases (accuracy: 89.7%; AUC: 0.984). SHAP analysis highlighted clinically recognized biomarkers (MLH1, PMS2, STAT1) and identified novel protein candidates (MTHFD2, MAST4, RPL22L1, MX2, SEC16A). LIME analysis provided individualized prediction interpretations, clarifying each protein biomarker's influence on model decisions. Conclusion Our proteomics-driven ML approach demonstrates high accuracy and interpretability in EC subtype classification and TMB prediction. By identifying validated and novel biomarkers, this strategy provides essential biological insights and a strong foundation for the future development of non-invasive diagnostics, personalized treatments, and precision medicine in EC.

AB  - Globally, ovarian cancer affects women disproportionately, causing significant morbidity and mortality rates. The early diagnosis of ovarian cancer is necessary for enhancing patient health and survival rates. This research article explores the utilization of Machine Learning (ML) techniques alongside eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methodologies to aid in the early detection of ovarian cancer. ML techniques have recently gained popularity in developing predictive models to detect early-stage ovarian cancer. These predictions are made using XAI in a transparent and understandable way for healthcare professionals and patients. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of various ovarian cancer prediction methodologies. This includes assessing K Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Decision trees, and ensemble learning techniques such as Max Voting, Boosting, Bagging, and Stacking. A dataset of 349 patients with known ovarian cancer status was collected from Kaggle. The dataset included a comprehensive range of clinical features such as age, family history, tumor markers, and imaging characteristics. Preprocessing techniques were applied to enhance input data, including feature scaling and dimensionality reduction. A Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (MRMR) algorithm was used to select the features in the model. Our experimental results demonstrate that in Support Vector Machines, we found 85 % base model accuracy and 89 % accuracy after stacking several ensemble learning techniques. With the help of XAI, complex ML algorithms can be given more profound insights into their decision-making, improving their applicability. This paper aims to introduce the best practices for integrating ML and artificial intelligence in biomarker evaluation. Building and evaluating Shapley values-based classifiers and visualizing results were the focus of our investigation. The study contributes to the field of oncology and women's health by offering a promising approach to the early diagnosis of ovarian cancer.

AB  - Background Heterogeneity among patients' responses to treatment is prevalent in psychiatric disorders. Personalized medicine approaches-which involve parsing patients into subgroups better indicated for a particular treatment-could therefore improve patient outcomes and serve as a powerful tool in patient selection within clinical trials. Machine learning approaches can identify patient subgroups but are often not "explainable" due to the use of complex algorithms that do not mirror clinicians' natural decision-making processes. Methods Here we combine two analytical approaches-Personalized Advantage Index and Bayesian Rule Lists-to identify paliperidone-indicated schizophrenia patients in a way that emphasizes model explainability. We apply these approaches retrospectively to randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial data to identify a paliperidone-indicated subgroup of schizophrenia patients who demonstrate a larger treatment effect (outcome on treatment superior than on placebo) than that of the full randomized sample as assessed with Cohen's d. For this study, the outcome corresponded to a reduction in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score which measures positive (e.g., hallucinations, delusions), negative (e.g., blunted affect, emotional withdrawal), and general psychopathological (e.g., disturbance of volition, uncooperativeness) symptoms in schizophrenia. Results Using our combined explainable AI approach to identify a subgroup more responsive to paliperidone than placebo, the treatment effect increased significantly over that of the full sample (p < 0.0001 for a one-sample t-test comparing the full sample Cohen's d = 0.82 and a generated distribution of subgroup Cohen's d's with mean d = 1.22, std d = 0.09). In addition, our modeling approach produces simple logical statements (if-then-else), termed a "rule list", to ease interpretability for clinicians. A majority of the rule lists generated from cross-validation found two general psychopathology symptoms, disturbance of volition and uncooperativeness, to predict membership in the paliperidone-indicated subgroup. Conclusions These results help to technically validate our explainable AI approach to patient selection for a clinical trial by identifying a subgroup with an improved treatment effect. With these data, the explainable rule lists also suggest that paliperidone may provide an improved therapeutic benefit for the treatment of schizophrenia patients with either of the symptoms of high disturbance of volition or high uncooperativeness.

KW  - EXTRACTION
AB  - Healthcare fraud, waste and abuse are costly problems that have huge impact on society. Traditional approaches to identify non-compliant claims rely on auditing strategies requiring trained professionals, or on machine learning methods requiring labelled data and possibly lacking interpretability. We present Clais, a collaborative artificial intelligence system for claims analysis. Clais automatically extracts human-interpretable rules from healthcare policy documents (0.72 F1-score), and it enables professionals to edit and validate the extracted rules through an intuitive user interface. Clais executes the rules on claim records to identify non-compliance: on this task Clais significantly outperforms two baseline machine learning models, and its median F1-score is 1.0 (IQR = 0.83 to 1.0) when executing the extracted rules, and 1.0 (IQR = 1.0 to 1.0) when executing the same rules after human curation. Professionals confirm through a user study the usefulness of Clais in making their workflow simpler and more effective.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a significant global health threat, with projections indicating it could surpass cancer in mortality rates by 2050 if left unaddressed. Optimizing antimicrobial dosing is critical to mitigate resistance and improve clinical outcomes. Traditional approaches, including population pharmacokinetics (PK) models and Bayesian estimation, are limited by mechanistic hypothesis requirements and complexity. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) offer transformative solutions by leveraging large datasets to predict drug exposure accurately, refine sampling strategies, and enable real-time dose adjustments through therapeutic drug monitoring. This review highlights the role of ML models, in managing PK and pharmacodynamic variability across diverse patient populations. AI models often equal or outperform traditional methods in achieving therapeutic targets while minimizing toxicity, as demonstrated in some case studies involving ganciclovir, vancomycin, and daptomycin. Despite challenges such as data quality, interpretability, and integration with clinical workflows, AI's dynamic adaptability and precision underscore its potential. Future directions emphasize integrating multi-omics data, developing bedside decision-support tools, and expanding AI applications to broader drug categories and populations. Continued research and clinical validation are essential to harness AI's full potential in advancing precision medicine and combating AMR effectively.

AB  - The coronavirus epidemic has spread to virtually every country on the globe, inflicting enormous health, financial, and emotional devastation, as well as the collapse of healthcare systems in some countries. Any automated COVID detection system that allows for fast detection of the COVID-19 infection might be highly beneficial to the healthcare service and people around the world. Molecular or antigen testing along with radiology X-ray imaging is now utilized in clinics to diagnose COVID-19. Nonetheless, due to a spike in coronavirus and hospital doctors' overwhelming workload, developing an AI-based auto-COVID detection system with high accuracy has become imperative. On X-ray images, the diagnosis of COVID-19, non-COVID-19 non-COVID viral pneumonia, and other lung opacity can be challenging. This research utilized artificial intelligence (AI) to deliver high-accuracy automated COVID-19 detection from normal chest X-ray images. Further, this study extended to differentiate COVID-19 from normal, lung opacity and non-COVID viral pneumonia images. We have employed three distinct pre-trained models that are Xception, VGG19, and ResNet50 on a benchmark dataset of 21,165 X-ray images. Initially, we formulated the COVID-19 detection problem as a binary classification problem to classify COVID-19 from normal X-ray images and gained 97.5%, 97.5%, and 93.3% accuracy for Xception, VGG19, and ResNet50 respectively. Later we focused on developing an efficient model for multi-class classification and gained an accuracy of 75% for ResNet50, 92% for VGG19, and finally 93% for Xception. Although Xception and VGG19's performances were identical, Xception proved to be more efficient with its higher precision, recall, and f-1 scores. Finally, we have employed Explainable AI on each of our utilized model which adds interpretability to our study. Furthermore, we have conducted a comprehensive comparison of the model's explanations and the study revealed that Xception is more precise in indicating the actual features that are responsible for a model's predictions.This addition of explainable AI will benefit the medical professionals greatly as they will get to visualize how a model makes its prediction and won't have to trust our developed machine-learning models blindly.

AB  - Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) can help build trust between AI models and healthcare professionals in the context of medical image classification. XAI can help explain the reasoning behind predictions, which can help healthcare professionals understand and trust the AI model. This paper presents a novel, 'attention-guided Grad-CAM,' a class of explainability algorithms that will visually reveal the reasons for prediction in image classification. To implement the proposed methods, we used infrared breast images from the" Database of Mastology Research" First; we built a classifier for detecting breast cancer using an ensemble of three pre-trained networks. Then we implemented an attention-guided Grad-CAM using channel and spatial attention to visualize the critical regions of infrared breast image that will explain the reasons for the predictions. The proposed ensemble of the pre-trained network was able to classify the breast thermograms (Healthy / Tumour) with an accuracy of 98.04% (Precision: 97.22%, Specificity: 97.77%, Sensitivity: 98.21%, F1-Score: 97.49, AUC: 0.97). The proposed Attention guided Grad-CAM method was able distinctively show the hottest regions of the thermograms (tumor regions). The ablation study also showed an average drop in the model's 42.5% when the explanation maps were used instead of the original image. The activation score also increased by 25.35%. The proposed ensemble of pre-trained networks was able to classify the breast thermograms accurately, and the attention-guided Grad-CAM was able to visually explain the AI model's prediction using a heat map. The proposed model will aid in the adoption of AI techniques by healthcare professionals with trust.

AB  - Infectious/contagious diseases remain a significant global health challenge, necessitating accurate identification to mitigate their spread. The widespread adoption of wearable healthcare devices capable of continuously monitoring physiological parameters presents a unique opportunity for enhancing disease detection strategies. In this article, we develop a new data fusion-enabled explainable artificial intelligence-assisted light gradient boosting model (LightGBM) (FuXAI) model in edge networks to predict contagious disease in the early stage. The overall contributions of the proposed FuXAI model are threefold. First, we create a comprehensive health profile for each individual by employing data fusion techniques and integrating health parameters received from multiple sources. Second, we integrate a new lightweight machine learning (ML) model, the LightGBM, to predict the disease at resource-constraint edge devices over the fused data. Finally, we leverage the power of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to develop interpretable algorithms, integrating with the LightGBM that can identify subtle patterns and correlations within the fused data, potentially revealing early warning signs of infectious diseases and creating trust in medical professionals during decision-making. Extensive simulation results of the proposed model over the standard ML models using benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the model.

AB  - Combining deep learning (DL) with nanotechnology holds promise for transforming key facets of nanoscience and technology. This synergy could pave the way for groundbreaking advancements in the creation of novel materials, devices, and applications, unlocking unparalleled capabilities. In addition, monitoring psychological, emotional, and physical states is challenging, yet recent advancements in the Internet of Nano Things (IoNT), nano robot technology, and DL show promise in collecting and processing such data within home environments. Using DL techniques at the edge enables the processing of Internet of Things device data locally, preserving privacy and low latency. We present an edge IoNT system that integrates nanorobots and DL to identify diseases, generating actionable reports for medical decision-making. Explainable artificial intelligence enhances model transparency, aiding clinicians in understanding predictions. Intensive experiments have been carried out on Kvasir dataset to validate the applicability of the designed framework, where the accuracy of results demonstrated its potential for in-home healthcare management.

AB  - Computer systems for medical diagnosis based on machine learning are not mere science fiction. Despite undisputed potential benefits, such systems may also raise problems. Two (interconnected) issues are particularly significant from an ethical point of view: The first issue is that epistemic opacity is at odds with a common desire for understanding and potentially undermines information rights. The second (related) issue concerns the assignment of responsibility in cases of failure. The core of the two issues seems to be that understanding and responsibility are concepts that are intrinsically tied to the discursive practice of giving and asking for reasons. The challenge is to find ways to make the outcomes of machine learning algorithms compatible with our discursive practice. This comes down to the claim that we should try to integrate discursive elements into machine learning algorithms. Under the title of "explainable AI" initiatives heading in this direction are already under way. Extensive research in this field is needed for finding adequate solutions.

AB  - In the era of advanced machine learning techniques, the development of accurate predictive models for complex medical conditions, such as thyroid cancer, has shown remarkable progress. Accurate predictive models for thyroid cancer enhance early detection, improve resource allocation, and reduce overtreatment. However, the widespread adoption of these models in clinical practice demands predictive performance along with interpretability and transparency. This paper proposes a novel association -rule based feature -integrated machine learning model which shows better classification and prediction accuracy than present state-of-the-art models. Our study also focuses on the application of SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values as a powerful tool for explaining thyroid cancer prediction models. In the proposed method, the association -rule based feature integration framework identifies frequently occurring attribute combinations in the dataset. The original dataset is used in training machine learning models, and further used in generating SHAP values from these models. In the next phase, the dataset is integrated with the dominant feature sets identified through association -rule based analysis. This new integrated dataset is used in re-training the machine learning models. The new SHAP values generated from these models help in validating the contributions of feature sets in predicting malignancy. The conventional machine learning models lack interpretability, which can hinder their integration into clinical decision -making systems. In this study, the SHAP values are introduced along with association -rule based feature integration as a comprehensive framework for understanding the contributions of feature sets in modelling the predictions. The study discusses the importance of reliable predictive models for early diagnosis of thyroid cancer, and a validation framework of explainability. The proposed model shows an accuracy of 93.48%. Performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1 -score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) are also higher than the baseline models. The results of the proposed model help us identify the dominant feature sets that impact thyroid cancer classification and prediction. The features { calcification } and { shape } consistently emerged as the top -ranked features associated with thyroid malignancy, in both association -rule based interestingness metric values and SHAP methods. The paper highlights the potential of the rule -based integrated models with SHAP in bridging the gap between the machine learning predictions and the interpretability of this prediction which is required for real -world medical applications.

AB  - Antibiotic resistance poses a significant threat to global public health due to complex interactions between bacterial genetic factors and external influences such as antibiotic misuse. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers innovative strategies to address this crisis. For example, AI can analyze genomic data to detect resistance markers early on, enabling early interventions. In addition, AI-powered decision support systems can optimize antibiotic use by recommending the most effective treatments based on patient data and local resistance patterns. AI can accelerate drug discovery by predicting the efficacy of new compounds and identifying potential antibacterial agents. Although progress has been made, challenges persist, including data quality, model interpretability, and real-world implementation. A multidisciplinary approach that integrates AI with other emerging technologies, such as synthetic biology and nanomedicine, could pave the way for effective prevention and mitigation of antimicrobial resistance, preserving the efficacy of antibiotics for future generations.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare describes algorithm-based computational techniques which manage and analyse large datasets to make inferences and predictions. There are many potential applications of AI in the care of older people, from clinical decision support systems that can support identification of delirium from clinical records to wearable devices that can predict the risk of a fall. We held four meetings of older people, clinicians and AI researchers. Three priority areas were identified for AI application in the care of older people. These included: monitoring and early diagnosis of disease, stratified care and care coordination between healthcare providers. However, the meetings also highlighted concerns that AI may exacerbate health inequity for older people through bias within AI models, lack of external validation amongst older people, infringements on privacy and autonomy, insufficient transparency of AI models and lack of safeguarding for errors. Creating effective interventions for older people requires a person-centred approach to account for the needs of older people, as well as sufficient clinical and technological governance to meet standards of generalisability, transparency and effectiveness. Education of clinicians and patients is also needed to ensure appropriate use of AI technologies, with investment in technological infrastructure required to ensure equity of access.

AB  - Introduction The integration of pathology and radiology through artificial intelligence (AI) represents a groundbreaking advancement in medical imaging, providing a powerful tool for accurate diagnostics and the optimization of clinical workflows. Traditional image classification methods encounter substantial challenges due to the inherent complexity and heterogeneity of medical imaging datasets, which include multi-modal data sources, imbalanced class distributions, and the critical need for interpretability in clinical decision-making.Methods Addressing these limitations, this study introduces an innovative deep learning-based framework tailored for AI-assisted medical imaging tasks. It incorporates two novel components: the Adaptive Multi-Resolution Imaging Network (AMRI-Net) and the Explainable Domain-Adaptive Learning (EDAL) strategy. AMRI-Net enhances diagnostic accuracy by leveraging multi-resolution feature extraction, attention-guided fusion mechanisms, and task-specific decoders, allowing the model to accurately identify both detailed and overarching patterns across various imaging techniques, such as X-rays, CT, and MRI scans. EDAL significantly improves domain generalizability through advanced domain alignment techniques while integrating uncertainty-aware learning to prioritize high-confidence predictions. It employs attention-based interpretability tools to highlight critical image regions, improving transparency and clinical trust in AI-driven diagnoses.Results Experimental results on multi-modal medical imaging datasets underscore the framework's superior performance, with classification accuracies reaching up to 94.95% and F1-Scores up to 94.85%, thereby enhancing transparency and clinical trust in AI-driven diagnoses.Discussion This research bridges the gap between pathology and radiology, offering a comprehensive AI-driven solution that aligns with the evolving demands of modern healthcare by ensuring precision, reliability, and interpretability in medical imaging.

AB  - PurposeIn this prospective external validation study, we examined the performance of the Supporting SURgery with GEriatric Co-Management and AI (SURGE-Ahead) postoperative delirium (POD) prediction algorithm. SURGE-Ahead is a collaborative project that aims to develop a clinical decision support system that uses predictive models to support geriatric co-management in surgical wards. Delirium is a common complication in older adults after surgery, leading to poor outcomes and increased healthcare costs. Early and accurate prediction of POD is crucial for timely intervention and prevention strategies.MethodsThe SURGE-Ahead algorithm utilizes a linear support vector machine model with a comprehensive set of 15 clinical and demographic features. In our validation, we analyzed 173 study participants, of which 50 developed POD.ResultsThe study found that the SURGE-Ahead POD prediction algorithm yielded state-of-the-art performance, using only preoperative data, with a receiver operating characteristics area under the curve of 0.86. In addition, the SURGE-Ahead algorithm exhibited good calibration as shown by a Brier Score of 0.14. The algorithm is openly available on GitHub, facilitating its implementation and adaptation to different surgical settings.ConclusionOur findings contribute to the development of reliable POD prediction tools, ultimately supporting the improvement of patient care in hospitalized older adults.

AB  - Breast tumor detection and classification on the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) can be automated with the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Deep learning models rely on large datasets, however, challenges arise when dealing with sensitive medical data. Restrictions on sharing these medical data result in limited publicly available datasets thereby impacting the performance of the deep learning models. To address this issue, we propose an approach that combines different magnification factors of histopathological images using a residual network and information fusion in Federated Learning (FL). FL is employed to preserve the privacy of patient data, while enabling the creation of a global model. Using the BreakHis dataset, we compare the performance of FL with centralized learning (CL). We also performed visualizations for explainable AI. The final models obtained become available for deployment on internal IoMT systems in healthcare institutions for timely diagnosis and treatment. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing works in the literature on multiple metrics.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Integrating Artificial Intelligence Clinical Decision Support Systems (AI-CDSSs) into healthcare can improve diagnostic accuracy, optimize clinical workflows, and support evidence-based medical decision-making. However, the adoption of AI-CDSSs remains uneven, influenced by technological, organizational, and perceptual factors. This study, conducted between November 2024 and February 2025, analyzes the determinants of AI-CDSS adoption among healthcare professionals through investigating the impacts of perceived benefits, technological costs, and social and institutional influence, as well as the transparency and control of algorithms, using an adapted Path Dependence-Augmented-Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology model. Methods: This research was conducted through a cross-sectional study, employing a structured questionnaire administered to a sample of 440 healthcare professionals selected using a stratified sampling methodology. Data were collected via specialized platforms and analyzed using structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to examine the relationships between variables and the impacts of key factors on the intention to adopt AI-CDSSs. Results: The findings highlight that the perceived benefits of AI-CDSSs are the strongest predictor of intention to adopt AI-CDSSs, while technology effort cost negatively impacts attitudes toward AI-CDSSs. Additionally, social and institutional influence fosters acceptance, whereas perceived control and transparency over AI enhance trust, reinforcing the necessity for explainable and clinician-supervised AI systems. Conclusions: This study confirms that the intention to adopt AI-CDSSs in healthcare depends on the perception of utility, technological accessibility, and system transparency. The creation of interpretable and adaptive AI architectures, along with training programs dedicated to healthcare professionals, represents measures enhancing the degree of acceptance.

AB  - Data quality is a key factor in the development of trustworthy AI in healthcare. A large volume of curated datasets with controlled confounding factors can improve the accuracy, robustness, and privacy of downstream AI algorithms. However, access to high-quality datasets is limited by the technical difficulties of data acquisition, and large-scale sharing of healthcare data is hindered by strict ethical restrictions. Data synthesis algorithms, which generate data with distributions similar to real clinical data, can serve as a potential solution to address the scarcity of good quality data during the development of trustworthy AI. However, state-of-the-art data synthesis algorithms, especially deep learning algorithms, focus more on imaging data while neglecting the synthesis of non-imaging healthcare data, including clinical measurements, medical signals and waveforms, and electronic healthcare records (EHRs). Therefore, in this article, we will review synthesis algorithms, particularly for non-imaging medical data, with the aim of providing trustworthy AI in this domain. This tutorial-style review article will provide comprehensive descriptions of non-imaging medical data synthesis, covering aspects such as algorithms, evaluations, limitations, and future research directions.

AB  - Background Artificial intelligence (AI) has played an important role in the field of medical risk prediction with its strong learning ability and data processing capabilities. With the rapid development of research in this field, it is necessary to conduct quantitative literature analysis to understand the development trends and research hotspots of AI in the field of medical risk prediction.Objective Through a comprehensive bibliometric analysis, this paper summarizes the development stage and key research hotspots of the application of AI in the field of medical risk prediction in the past 20 years. Additionally, we provide a thorough analysis of emerging trends and future directions, offering insights into how advancements in AI are likely to shape risk prediction methodologies and their clinical applications in the years to come.Methods Relevant articles from the establishment of the database to 2024 were retrieved through Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index of the Web of Science Core Collection. Citespace, VOSviewer, Scimago Graphica, Pajek, and other software were used for bibliometric and visual analysis.Result A total of 2080 articles were included. From 1986 to 2004, this field experienced a slow development period, with the number of papers published per year less than 10. From 2005 to 2020, the number of papers published increased with a linear trend, and entered an exponential rapid growth stage after 2020, with the development entering a mature stage. The United States was the country with the most extensive cooperation and the largest number of publications (652 articles, 31.35%). The diseases, AI technologies, and functions that have received the most attention in this field are cancer, machine learning, and prediction, respectively.Conclusions Artificial intelligence in medical risk prediction has transitioned from technical exploration to a critical component of clinical practice, expanding from single-disease forecasts to complex, multimodal assessments. Advances in machine learning and personalized medicine have integrated AI into medical decision-making and management, yet widespread adoption requires addressing challenges related to interpretability, privacy, ethics, reliability, and standardization. In the future, AI is expected to significantly enhance prediction accuracy, optimize health management, and advance personalized medicine.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a rapidly growing neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects the elderly population. Until now, there has been no antidote for PD. However, diagnosing Parkinson's disease in its early stages is difficult. Early treatment will help people with Parkinson's disease improve their quality of life. The primary goal of this work is to increase the early diagnostic accuracy of Parkinson's disease using deep learning models and to make the models more transparent and trustworthy. It proved challenging to comprehend the methods by which the classifiers made predictions about Parkinson's disease. It would be valuable if the outcomes generated by these classifiers could be clarified in a reliable and trustworthy manner. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (EXAI) focuses on enhancing clinical health practises and bringing transparency to predictive analysis, both of which are critical in the healthcare arena. We proposed a new hybrid deep transfer learning model to distinguish PD patients from healthy individuals. The proposed architecture combines the advantages of both VGG19 Net and Google Net. This study also shows the experimental outcomes of various pre-trained models such as Alex Net, DenseNet-201, VGG-19 Net, Squeeze Net1.1, and ResNet-50. The VGG19-INC model predicts PD with an accuracy of 98.45%, which is greater than other state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating the proposed work's superiority and robustness. To demystify the VGG19-INC model, explainable AI approaches such as LIME are used to identify the specific parts of the spiral and wave drawings that contribute most to the model's prediction. These methods provide local interpretation, making it easier to understand how the model arrives at its conclusions.

AB  - The past decade has seen an explosion in the amount of digital information stored in electronic health records (EHRs). While primarily designed for archiving patient information and performing administrative healthcare tasks like billing, many researchers have found secondary use of these records for various clinical informatics applications. Over the same period, the machine learning community has seen widespread advances in the field of deep learning. In this review, we survey the current research on applying deep learning to clinical tasks based on EHR data, where we find a variety of deep learning techniques and frameworks being applied to several types of clinical applications including information extraction, representation learning, outcome prediction, phenotyping, and deidentification. We identify several limitations of current research involving topics such as model interpretability, data heterogeneity, and lack of universal benchmarks. We conclude by summarizing the state of the field and identifying avenues of future deep EHR research.

AB  - The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is increasingly replacing the traditional healthcare systems. However, less focus has been paid to their security against cyber-threats in the implementation of the IoMT and its networks. One of the key reasons can be the challenging task of optimizing typical security solutions to the IoMT networks. And despite the rising admiration of machine learning and deep learning methods in the cyber-security domain (e.g., a threat detection system), most of these methods are acknowledged as a black-box model. The explainable AI (XAI) has become progressively vital to understand the employed learning models to improve trust level and empower security experts to interpret the prediction decisions. The authors propose a highly efficient model named XSRU-IoMT, for effective and timely detection of sophisticated attack vectors in IoMT networks. The proposed model is developed using novel bidirectional simple recurrent units (SRU) using the phenomenon of skip connections to eradicate the vanishing gradient problem and achieve a fast training process in recurrent networks. We also explore the concepts of XAI to improve trust level by providing explanations of the predictive decisions and enabling humans and security experts to understand the causal reasoning and underlying data evidence. The evaluation results on the ToN_IoT dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed XSRU-IoMT model as compared to the state-of-the-art compelling detection models, suggesting its usefulness as a viable deployment model in real-IoMT networks.

AB  - BackgroundArtificial intelligence-driven Clinical Decision Support Systems (AI-CDSS) are increasingly being integrated into healthcare for various purposes, including resource allocation. While these systems promise improved efficiency and decision-making, they also raise significant ethical concerns. This study aims to explore healthcare professionals' perspectives on the ethical implications of using AI-CDSS for healthcare resource allocation.MethodsWe conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with 23 healthcare professionals, including physicians, nurses, administrators, and medical ethicists in Turkey. Interviews focused on participants' views regarding the use of AI-CDSS in resource allocation, potential ethical challenges, and recommendations for responsible implementation. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis.ResultsParticipant responses are clustered around five pre-determined thematic areas: (1) balancing efficiency and equity in resource allocation, (2) the importance of transparency and explicability in AI-CDSS, (3) shifting roles and responsibilities in clinical decision-making, (4) ethical considerations in data usage and algorithm development, and (5) balancing cost-effectiveness and patient-centered care. Participants acknowledged the potential of AI-CDSS to optimize resource allocation but expressed concerns about exacerbating healthcare disparities, the need for interpretable AI models, changing professional roles, data privacy, and maintaining individualized care.ConclusionsThe integration of AI-CDSS into healthcare resource allocation presents both opportunities and significant ethical challenges. Our findings underscore the need for robust ethical frameworks, enhanced AI literacy among healthcare professionals, interdisciplinary collaboration, and rigorous monitoring and evaluation processes. Addressing these challenges proactively is crucial for harnessing the potential of AI-CDSS while preserving the fundamental values of equity, transparency, and patient-centered care in healthcare delivery.

AB  - Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) research in healthcare is accelerating rapidly, with potential applications being demonstrated across various domains of medicine. However, there are currently limited examples of such techniques being successfully deployed into clinical practice. This article explores the main challenges and limitations of AI in healthcare, and considers the steps required to translate these potentially transformative technologies from research to clinical practice.
   Main body: Key challenges for the translation of AI systems in healthcare include those intrinsic to the science of machine learning, logistical difficulties in implementation, and consideration of the barriers to adoption as well as of the necessary sociocultural or pathway changes. Robust peer-reviewed clinical evaluation as part of randomised controlled trials should be viewed as the gold standard for evidence generation, but conducting these in practice may not always be appropriate or feasible. Performance metrics should aim to capture real clinical applicability and be understandable to intended users. Regulation that balances the pace of innovation with the potential for harm, alongside thoughtful post-market surveillance, is required to ensure that patients are not exposed to dangerous interventions nor deprived of access to beneficial innovations. Mechanisms to enable direct comparisons of AI systems must be developed, including the use of independent, local and representative test sets. Developers of AI algorithms must be vigilant to potential dangers, including dataset shift, accidental fitting of confounders, unintended discriminatory bias, the challenges of generalisation to new populations, and the unintended negative consequences of new algorithms on health outcomes.
   Conclusion: The safe and timely translation of AI research into clinically validated and appropriately regulated systems that can benefit everyone is challenging. Robust clinical evaluation, using metrics that are intuitive to clinicians and ideally go beyond measures of technical accuracy to include quality of care and patient outcomes, is essential. Further work is required (1) to identify themes of algorithmic bias and unfairness while developing mitigations to address these, (2) to reduce brittleness and improve generalisability, and (3) to develop methods for improved interpretability of machine learning predictions. If these goals can be achieved, the benefits for patients are likely to be transformational.

KW  - ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) offers the potential to support healthcare delivery, but poorly trained or validated algorithms bear risks of harm. Ethical guidelines stated transparency about model development and validation as a requirement for trustworthy AI. Abundant guidance exists to provide transparency through reporting, but poorly reported medical AI tools are common. To close this transparency gap, we developed and piloted a framework to quantify the transparency of medical AI tools with three use cases. Our framework comprises a survey to report on the intended use, training and validation data and processes, ethical considerations, and deployment recommendations. The transparency of each response was scored with either 0, 0.5, or 1 to reflect if the requested information was not, partially, or fully provided. Additionally, we assessed on an analogous three-point scale if the provided responses fulfilled the transparency requirement for a set of trustworthiness criteria from ethical guidelines. The degree of transparency and trustworthiness was calculated on a scale from 0% to 100%. Our assessment of three medical AI use cases pin-pointed reporting gaps and resulted in transparency scores of 67% for two use cases and one with 59%. We report anecdotal evidence that business constraints and limited information from external datasets were major obstacles to providing transparency for the three use cases. The observed transparency gaps also lowered the degree of trustworthiness, indicating compliance gaps with ethical guidelines. All three pilot use cases faced challenges to provide transparency about medical AI tools, but more studies are needed to investigate those in the wider medical AI sector. Applying this framework for an external assessment of transparency may be infeasible if business constraints prevent the disclosure of information. New strategies may be necessary to enable audits of medical AI tools while preserving business secrets.

AB  - Machine learning is increasingly and ubiquitously being used in the medical domain. Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall may indicate the performance of the models but not necessarily the reliability of their outcomes. This paper assesses the effectiveness of a number of machine learning algorithms applied to an important dataset in the medical domain, specifically, mental health, by employing explainability methodologies. Using multiple machine learning algorithms and model explainability techniques, this work provides insights into the models' workings to help determine the reliability of the machine learning algorithm predictions. The results are not intuitive. It was found that the models were focusing significantly on less relevant features and, at times, unsound ranking of the features to make the predictions. This paper therefore argues that it is important for research in applied machine learning to provide insights into the explainability of models in addition to other performance metrics like accuracy. This is particularly important for applications in critical domains such as healthcare.

AB  - Tree-based machine learning models such as random forests, decision trees and gradient boosted trees are popular nonlinear predictive models, yet comparatively little attention has been paid to explaining their predictions. Here we improve the interpretability of tree-based models through three main contributions. (1) A polynomial time algorithm to compute optimal explanations based on game theory. (2) A new type of explanation that directly measures local feature interaction effects. (3) A new set of tools for understanding global model structure based on combining many local explanations of each prediction. We apply these tools to three medical machine learning problems and show how combining many high-quality local explanations allows us to represent global structure while retaining local faithfulness to the original model. These tools enable us to (1) identify high-magnitude but low-frequency nonlinear mortality risk factors in the US population, (2) highlight distinct population subgroups with shared risk characteristics, (3) identify nonlinear interaction effects among risk factors for chronic kidney disease and (4) monitor a machine learning model deployed in a hospital by identifying which features are degrading the model's performance over time. Given the popularity of tree-based machine learning models, these improvements to their interpretability have implications across a broad set of domains. Tree-based machine learning models are widely used in domains such as healthcare, finance and public services. The authors present an explanation method for trees that enables the computation of optimal local explanations for individual predictions, and demonstrate their method on three medical datasets.

AB  - Manifold learning techniques play a pivotal role in machine learning by revealing lower-dimensional embeddings within high-dimensional data, thereby enhancing the efficiency, interpretability, and scalability of data analysis. Despite their utility, current manifold learning methods often lack explicit functional mappings, which are critical for ensuring explainability in regulated and high-stakes applications. This paper introduces Genetic Programming for Explainable Manifold Learning (GP-EMaL), a novel integration of Genetic Programming (GP) and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). GP-EMaL leverages the inherently interpretable, tree-based structures of GP to generate explicit, functional mappings while directly addressing complexity challenges through innovative penalties for tree size, symmetry, and operator selection. By enabling customisable complexity metrics, GP-EMaL adapts to diverse application needs, achieving high manifold quality and significantly improved explainability. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that GP-EMaL matches or exceeds the performance of existing approaches, producing simpler and more interpretable models. This work advances the state of explainable manifold learning, paving the way for its adoption in domains such as healthcare, environmental modelling, and financial analysis.

AB  - Computer-guided clinical decision support systems have been finding their way into practice for some time, mostly integrated into electronic medical records. The primary goals are to improve the quality of treatment, save time and avoid errors. These are mostly rule-based algorithms that recognize drug interactions or provide reminder functions. Through artificial intelligence (AI), clinical decision support systems can be disruptively further developed. New knowledge is constantly being created from data through machine learning in order to predict the individual course of a patient's disease, identify phenotypes or support treatment decisions. Such algorithms already exist for rheumatological diseases. Automated image recognition and disease prediction in rheumatoid arthritis are the most advanced; however, these have not yet been sufficiently tested or integrated into existing decision support systems. Rather than dictating the AI-assisted choice of treatment to the doctor, future clinical decision systems are seen as hybrid decision support, always involving both the expert and the patient. There is also a great need for security through comprehensible and auditable algorithms to sustainably guarantee the quality and transparency of AI-assisted treatment recommendations in the long term.

AB  - Pseudogenes, once regarded as genomic relics, have emerged as critical regulators of gene expression, influencing cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and developmental processes. This study introduces an advanced framework for pseudogene classification, leveraging deep learning to address the challenges of large-scale transcriptomic analysis. The proposed approach integrates an autoencoder for dimensionality reduction, a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) for synthetic data generation, and a TabNet classifier for final prediction. Extensive literature on pseudogenes highlights their interaction with coding genes, non-coding RNAs, and epigenetic mechanisms, which are pivotal in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. The pipeline uses SMOTE to mitigate class imbalance and applies synthetic feature augmentation to boost classification performance. Tested on a large-scale curated transcriptomic dataset, our framework achieves an accuracy of 96%, surpassing traditional machine learning models. Visualization tools such as t-SNE, heatmaps, and SHAP plots further enhance model interpretability. The system is fully implemented on accessible AI platforms (Google Colab, Kaggle), ensuring real-time simulation and reproducibility, especially for research teams with limited computational resources. This method offers a scalable, explainable solution for pseudogene identification and non-coding RNA characterization, with broad applications in cancer research, genome annotation, and precision transcriptomics. The results underscore the power of deep learning and generative models in unveiling the regulatory complexity of pseudogenes, contributing to future genomic studies and clinical precision medicine. Additionally, a user-friendly Gradio interface has been developed, enabling interactive exploration and prediction of pseudogene classes, providing a practical tool for biologists and clinicians alike.

AB  - Machine Learning Health Operations (MLHOps) is the combination of processes for reliable, efficient, usable, and ethical deployment and maintenance of machine learning models in healthcare settings. This paper provides both a survey of work in this area and guidelines for developers and clinicians to deploy and maintain their own models in clinical practice. We cover the foundational concepts of general machine learning operations and describe the initial setup of MLHOps pipelines (including data sources, preparation, engineering, and tools). We then describe long-term monitoring and updating (including data distribution shifts and model updating) and ethical considerations (including bias, fairness, interpretability, and privacy). This work therefore provides guidance across the full pipeline of MLHOps from conception to initial and ongoing deployment. We also include a checklist to ensure thorough verification of each step in the process.

KW  - SELECTION
AB  - Interpretability in machine learning has become increasingly important as machine learning is being used in more and more applications, including those with high-stakes consequences such as healthcare where Interpretability has been regarded as a key to the successful adoption of machine learning models. However, using confounding/irrelevant information in making predictions by deep learning models, even the interpretable ones, poses critical challenges to their clinical acceptance. That has recently drawn researchers' attention to issues beyond the mere interpretation of deep learning models. In this paper, we first investigate application of an inherently interpretable prototype-based architecture, known as ProtoPNet, for breast cancer classification in digital pathology and highlight its shortcomings in this application. Then, we propose a new method that uses more medically relevant information and makes more accurate and interpretable predictions. Our method leverages the clustering concept and implicitly increases the number of classes in the training dataset. The proposed method learns more relevant prototypes without any pixel-level annotated data. To have a more holistic assessment, in addition to classification accuracy, we define a new metric for assessing the degree of interpretability based on the comments of a group of skilled pathologists. Experimental results on the BreakHis dataset show that the proposed method effectively improves the classification accuracy and interpretability by respectively 8% and 18%. Therefore, the proposed method can be seen as a step toward implementing interpretable deep learning models for the detection of breast cancer using histopathology images.

AB  - Code Blue is an emergency alert signal activated whenever a hospitalized patient experiences cardiac or respiratory arrest. This research aims to build an interpretable machine-learning model for predicting Code Blue events before they can happen. This study uses the electronic medical record data of the patient for the last 24 hours and the doctor's clinical notes. We use the technique of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract features from the doctor's clinical notes. The extracted features are combined with other electronic medical data, such as vital information, pre-existing diseases, and organ dysfunction, to build the final prediction model. We use Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods to interpret the model. The enhanced ability to explain the model output will help healthcare professionals better understand the early warning signals of Code Blue. The prompt alert from an early warning signal ensures that patients receive immediate care from medical practitioners, thereby substantially increasing the potential for saving lives. Based on these findings, hospital managers can reframe the policy regarding the announcement of Code Blue. Hospitals can use a decision support tool to prioritize patients and manage the operations of the code blue team.

AB  - Medical imaging enables doctors to peer inside the patient's body without harm, playing a vital role in diagnosis and therapy planning. Traditional supervised deep learning models rely heavily on extensive labeled data, which is resource-intensive and time-consuming, especially in the medical field. To overcome this challenge, SemiSupervised and Self-Supervised Learning systems, which leverage both labeled and unlabeled data, have been widely explored. Consequently, Semi-Supervised and Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) systems, which leverage both labelled and unlabeled data to improve diagnostic performance and efficiency, have been widely studied. This review explores the use of Semi-SL and Self-SL in managing large volumes of unlabeled data alongside labelled data as feasible options for medical image analysis, especially for MRI, X-ray, and CT scans. The study highlights key SSL techniques such as contrastive learning, reconstruction-based training, and pseudo-labelling for enhancing diagnostic accuracy and model generalization. Specifically, contrastive learning has demonstrated benefits in X-ray anomaly detection, pseudo-labelling has improved fracture identification and brain region segmentation, and reconstruction-based training has advanced MRI and generative 3D CT scan image reconstruction models. Although these approaches still face challenges such as data availability, computational requirements, and model interpretability, they exhibit great potential for clinical use. This research further examines the capacity of Semi-SL and Self-SL to increase diagnostic precision, deliver clinically feasible timeframes, and provide cost-effective care. Future work will aim to refine these methods for better clinical integration and to make them more understandable to clinicians.

AB  - BackgroundSingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized cellular heterogeneity analysis by decoding gene expression profiles at individual cell level, while machine learning (ML) has emerged as core computational tool for clustering analysis, dimensionality reduction modeling and developmental trajectory inference in single-cell transcriptomics(SCT). Although 3,307 papers have been published in past two decades, there remains lack of bibliometric review comprehensively addressing methodological evolution, technical challenges and clinical translation pathways. This study aims to fill research gap through bibliometric and visual analysis, revealing technological evolution trends and future development directions.MethodsUsing 3,307 publications from Web of Science Core Collection(WOSCC), we conducted bibliometric and visualization analysis through CiteSpace and VOSviewer to systematically review research trends, national/institutional contributions, keyword co-occurrence networks and co-citation relationships. Data screening strictly limited to English articles and reviews, excluding irrelevant document types, focusing on core application scenarios of ML in SCT.ResultsChina and United States dominated research output (combined 65%), with China leading in publication volume (54.8%) while US demonstrating academic influence through H-index 84 and 37,135 total citations. Research hotspots concentrated on random forest (RF) and deep learning models, showing transition from algorithm development to clinical applications (e.g., tumor immune microenvironment analysis). Chinese Academy of Sciences and Harvard University emerged as core collaboration hubs, with international cooperation network primarily featuring US-China collaboration. Keyword clustering revealed four themes: gene expression, immunotherapy, bioinformatics, and inflammation-related research. Technical bottlenecks included data heterogeneity, insufficient model interpretability and weak cross-dataset generalization capability.ConclusionML-scRNA-seq integration has advanced cellular heterogeneity analysis and precision medicine development. Future directions should optimize deep learning architectures, enhance model generalization capabilities, and promote technical translation through multi-omics and clinical data integration. Interdisciplinary collaboration represents key to overcoming current limitations (e.g., data standardization, algorithm interpretability), ultimately realizing deep integration between single-cell technologies and precision medicine.

AB  - Introduction: The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in oncology has increased rapidly, transforming various healthcare areas such as pathology, radiology, diagnostics, prognosis, genomics, treatment planning, and clinical trials. However, perspectives, comfort levels, and concerns about AI in cancer care remain largely unexplored. Materials and Methods: This prospective, descriptive cross-sectional survey study was conducted between May 20, 2024 and October 22, 2024, among 363 patients with cancer from two different hospitals affiliated with Ankara University, a tertiary care center in T & uuml;rkiye. The survey included three distinct sections: (1) Perceptions: Patients' general views on AI's impact in oncology; (2) Attitudes: Comfort level with AI performing medical tasks; (3) Concerns: Specific fears related to AI implementation (eg, diagnostic errors, data privacy, healthcare costs). Survey responses were summarized descriptively, and differences by age, gender, and education were analyzed using chi-square tests. Results: A majority (50.7%) believed AI would somewhat (32%) or significantly (18.7%) improve healthcare. However, one-third of patients (33.1%) were very uncomfortable with AI diagnosing cancer, with higher discomfort among less-educated participants (P < .005). Top patient concerns included AI making incorrect diagnoses (31.1%), increasing healthcare costs (27.5%), and not keeping data private (19.6%). Patients with higher education levels expressed less discomfort and fewer concerns. Conclusions: Patients' perceptions and attitudes on AI varied significantly based on education, highlighting the need for targeted educational initiatives. While AI holds potential to revolutionize cancer care, addressing concerns about accuracy, security, and transparency is critical to enhance its acceptance and effectiveness in clinical practice.

AB  - Advances in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence offer tremendous potential benefits to patients. Predictive analytics using ML are already widely used in healthcare operations and care delivery, but how can ML be used for health economics and outcomes research (HEOR)? To answer this question, ISPOR established an emerging good practices task force for the application of ML in HEOR.
   The task force identified 5 methodological areas where ML could enhance HEOR: (1) cohort selection, identifying samples with greater specificity with respect to inclusion criteria; (2) identification of independent predictors and covariates of health outcomes; (3) predictive analytics of health outcomes, including those that are high cost or life threatening; (4) causal inference through methods, such as targeted maximum likelihood estimation or double-debiased estimation-helping to produce reliable evidence more quickly; and (5) application of ML to the development of economic models to reduce structural, parameter, and sampling uncertainty in cost-effectiveness analysis.
   Overall, ML facilitates HEOR through the meaningful and efficient analysis of big data. Nevertheless, a lack of transparency on how ML methods deliver solutions to feature selection and predictive analytics, especially in unsupervised circumstances, increases risk to providers and other decision makers in using ML results.
   To examine whether ML offers a useful and transparent solution to healthcare analytics, the task force developed the PAL-ISADE Checklist. It is a guide for balancing the many potential applications of ML with the need for transparency in methods development and findings.

AB  - The heterogeneity of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a challenge for the disease diagnosis and its evolution. In order to monitor the treatment and progression of MS, the segmentation and analysis of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions may offer quantitative evaluation metrics that may be used to compare images across various regions, patients, time points, and institutions. This study targets to provide a comprehensive review of brain MRI studies related to MS disease focusing on lesion segmentation, feature extraction, and Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD). Image segmentation methods were categorized regarding their supervision (i.e., supervised, and unsupervised), as well as their deep learning capability. Image analysis focused on feature extraction methods such as texture, structure, and image characterization. Furthermore, to address the challenges and future directions, enable better management of MS disease as well as offer personalized and precision medicine services in clinical praxis, an integrated CAD framework is proposed encompassing 3D reconstruction, registration and visualization, explainable artificial intelligence (AI) and assessment of disease evolution.

AB  - Drug response prediction is important to establish personalized medicine for cancer therapy. Model construction for predicting drug response (i.e., cell viability half-maximal inhibitory concentration [IC50]) of an individual drug by inputting pharmacogenomics in disease models remains critical. Machine learning (ML) has been predominantly applied for prediction, despite the advent of deep learning (DL). Moreover, whether DL or traditional ML models are superior for predicting cell viability IC50s has to be established. Herein, we constructed ML and DL drug response prediction models for 24 individual drugs and compared the performance of the models by employing gene expression and mutation profiles of cancer cell lines as input. We observed no significant difference in drug response prediction performance between DL and ML models for 24 drugs [root mean squared error (RMSE) ranging from 0.284 to 3.563 for DL and from 0.274 to 2.697 for ML; R-2 ranging from -7.405 to 0.331 for DL and from -8.113 to 0.470 for ML]. Among the 24 individual drugs, the ridge model of panobinostat exhibited the best performance (R-2 0.470 and RMSE 0.623). Thus, we selected the ridge model of panobinostat for further application of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Using XAI, we further identified important genomic features for panobinostat response prediction in the ridge model, suggesting the genomic features of 22 genes. Based on our findings, results for an individual drug employing both DL and ML models were comparable. Our study confirms the applicability of drug response prediction models for individual drugs.

AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder characterized by disrupted breathing during sleep, leading to serious health consequences such as daytime fatigue, hypertension, metabolic issues, and cardiovascular disease. Polysomnography (PSG) is the standard diagnostic method but is costly and uncomfortable for patients, which has led to interest in artificial intelligence (AI) for automated OSA detection. To develop an explainable AI model that utilizes electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) data for real-time apnea detection, providing visual explanations to enhance interpretability and support clinical decisions. It emphasizes giving visual explanations to show how specific segments of the signal contribute to the AI's conclusions. Furthermore, it explores the combination of individual models to improve detection accuracy. The fusion of individual models demonstrates an enhanced performance in detection accuracy. Visual explanations for AI decisions highlight the importance of certain signal features, making the model's operations transparent to healthcare providers. The proposed AI model addresses the crucial need for transparent and interpretable AI in healthcare. By providing real-time, explainable OSA detection, this approach represents a significant advancement in the field, potentially improving patient care and aiding in the early identification and management of OSA.

AB  - Background and objective: Cardiovascular disease (CD) is a major global health concern, affecting millions with symptoms like fatigue and chest discomfort. Timely identification is crucial due to its significant contribution to global mortality. In healthcare, artificial intelligence (AI) holds promise for advancing disease risk assessment and treatment outcome prediction. However, machine learning (ML) evolution raises concerns about data privacy and biases, especially in sensitive healthcare applications. The objective is to develop and implement a responsible AI model for CD prediction that prioritize patient privacy, security, ensuring transparency, explainability, fairness, and ethical adherence in healthcare applications. Methods: To predict CD while prioritizing patient privacy, our study employed data anonymization involved adding Laplace noise to sensitive features like age and gender. The anonymized dataset underwent analysis using a differential privacy (DP) framework to preserve data privacy. DP ensured confidentiality while extracting insights. Compared with Logistic Regression (LR), Gaussian Na & iuml;ve Bayes (GNB), and Random Forest (RF), the methodology integrated feature selection, statistical analysis, and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) for interpretability. This approach facilitates transparent and interpretable AI decision-making, aligning with responsible AI development principles. Overall, it combines privacy preservation, interpretability, and ethical considerations for accurate CD predictions. Results: Our investigations from the DP framework with LR were promising, with an area under curve (AUC) of 0.848 +/- 0.03, an accuracy of 0.797 +/- 0.02, precision at 0.789 +/- 0.02, recall at 0.797 +/- 0.02, and an F1 score of 0.787 +/- 0.02, with a comparable performance with the non-privacy framework. The SHAP and LIME based results support clinical findings, show a commitment to transparent and interpretable AI decision-making, and aligns with the principles of responsible AI development. Conclusions: Our study endorses a novel approach in predicting CD, amalgamating data anonymization, privacypreserving methods, interpretability tools SHAP, LIME, and ethical considerations. This responsible AI framework ensures accurate predictions, privacy preservation, and user trust, underscoring the significance of comprehensive and transparent ML models in healthcare. Therefore, this research empowers the ability to forecast CD, providing a vital lifeline to millions of CD patients globally and potentially preventing numerous fatalities.

AB  - Osteoporosis is a metabolic bone condition that occurs when bone mineral density and mass decrease. This makes the bones weak and brittle. The disorder is often undiagnosed and untreated due to its asymptomatic nature until the manifestation of a fracture. Machine Learning (ML) is extensively used in diverse healthcare domains to analyze precise outcomes, provide timely risk scores, and allocate resources. Hence, we have designed multiple heterogeneous machine learning frameworks to predict the risk of Osteoporosis. An open-source dataset of 1493 patients containing bone density, blood, and physical tests is utilized. Thirteen distinct feature selection techniques were leveraged to extract the most salient parameters. The best-performing pipeline consisted of a Forward Feature Selection algorithm followed by a custom multi-level ensemble learning-based stack, which achieved an accuracy of 89 %. Deploying a layer of explainable artificial intelligence using tools such as SHAP (SHapley Additive Values), LIME (Local Interpretable Model Explainer), ELI5, Qlattice, and feature importance provided interpretability and rationale behind classifier prediction. With this study, we aim to provide the holistic risk prediction of Osteoporosis and concurrently present a system for automated screening to assist physicians in making diagnostic decisions.

AB  - Deep learning models are increasingly reshaping medical imaging, with growing attention on ensuring transparency and trust in their decision-making processes. This study presents the Explainable Vision Transformer (XViT), a model specifically designed for histopathological image analysis. By incorporating advanced interpretability techniques, the XViT model addresses three core aspects: feature learning and classification, generating explainable outputs, and qualitatively evaluating these explanations. Three novel interpretability methods are introduced: attention-based, model-agnostic, and gradient-based, offering diverse perspectives on model behavior. The model's performance and generalizability were rigorously evaluated on two histopathological datasets: lung colon 25000 (LCS25000) with 96.2% accuracy across three classes and Kangbuk Samsung Hospital (KBSMC) with 88.6% accuracy across four classes. XViT provides actionable insights by highlighting diagnostically relevant regions in input images, significantly enhancing clinical trust and decision-making. The evaluation of its explainability methods through metrics like sensitivity, faithfulness, and complexity demonstrated that layer-wise relevance propagation for transformers outperforms standard techniques like local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) and attention visualization. This robust performance underscores the XViT model's potential to bridge the gap between AI accuracy and interpretability in medical imaging. Our findings emphasize the need for well-defined evaluation criteria when comparing interpretability methods and highlight the model's potential for integration into clinical workflows. This work represents a step forward in creating reliable and interpretable AI solutions, ensuring that the benefits of advanced deep learning models extend seamlessly into practical healthcare settings.

AB  - We have witnessed the impact of ML in disease diagnosis, image recognition and classification, and many more related fields. Healthcare is a sensitive field related to people's lives in which decisions need to be carefully taken based on solid evidence. However, most ML models are complex, i.e., black-box, meaning they do not provide insights into how the problems are solved or why such decisions are proposed. This lack of interpretability is the main reason why some ML models are not widely used yet in real environments such as healthcare. Therefore, it would be beneficial if ML models could provide explanations allowing physicians to make data-driven decisions that lead to higher quality service. Recently, several efforts have been made in proposing interpretable machine learning models to become more convenient and applicable in real environments. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive survey and symmetry phenomena of IML models and their applications in healthcare. The fundamental characteristics, theoretical underpinnings needed to develop IML, and taxonomy for IML are presented. Several examples of how they are applied in healthcare are investigated to encourage and facilitate the use of IML models in healthcare. Furthermore, current limitations, challenges, and future directions that might impact applying ML in healthcare are addressed.

AB  - Maternal health is a significant public health concern for globe and many developing countries. A country like India (with large population), there are considerable disparities in maternal health service utilisation and maternal mortality within and across states. A more than a general healthcare operational policy would suffice, but a precision healthcare strategy would be needed. This article focused on explainable machine learning models that can precisely advise health care intervention policy and medical treatment to an administrative unit rather than a generic policy suggestion for improving maternal health. This study presents an exhaustive list of factors associated with Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) and a series of explainable AI models. One of models uses CART heuristics to categorise districts (administrative boundaries) into lower and higher MMR classes. Another explainable model, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), used SVM, ANN, boosting, and random forest machine learning models to investigate higher and lower MMR regions. Further, an Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) also used, and the results are compared for policy suggestions. Some of the ignored features from general social science studies, such as topography and agro-climatic zone characteristics of a particular district, may be crucial in the analysis. Moreover, health infrastructure, insurance, and other factors also influence policymaking. This predictive and explainable work has significant implications for precision healthcare policy design to improve maternal health compared to a broader policy approach.

AB  - The widespread adoption of cloud computing, edge computing, and the Internet of Things across various domains has enhanced data management and automation capabilities. However, large-scale IoT implementations face considerable challenges, including concerns about data quality, security risks, and the need to identify anomalies. This study introduces a multi-tiered machine learning-based approach to detect anomalies, specifically targeting security threats, performance irregularities, and sensor malfunctions within IoT-Edge-Cloud ecosystems. The proposed system improves detection precision, response times, and overall security resilience by incorporating XAI for transparent decision-making and a layered security approach to mitigate threats. The framework operates on several levels: (i) the IoT Layer, where secure microcontrollers collect and transmit sensor data; (ii) the Edge/Fog Layer, which conducts pre-processing and real-time filtering to minimize cloud reliance; (iii) the Cloud Layer, where ML-based anomaly detection algorithms, such as the Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor, examine data; and (iv) the Smart Single-Page Application architecture that integrates IoT-Edge-Cloud ecosystem, which offers low-latency visualization, secure data transmission, and interactive anomaly monitoring. Furthermore, XAI techniques improve interpretability by identifying key factors that influence anomaly classification and increase transparency for security analysts. A case study in IoT-Healthcare settings validated the efficacy of the proposed system in identifying network intrusions, sensor failures, and operational anomalies, achieving an AUROC score of 1.00 using an isolated forest. Comparative assessments demonstrate that this approach surpasses existing anomaly detection solutions by enhancing detection accuracy, decreasing latency through edge processing, and improving explainability with AI integration. The study concludes by exploring the challenges and advantages of combining IoT, cloud and edge computing for secure and scalable anomaly detection, thus providing insight into optimal database management and security strategies for IoT-cloud interactions.

However, their black-box nature complicates their use, especially in critical applications such as healthcare. To solve this problem, researchers have proposed different approaches to interpret RL models. Some of these methods were adopted from machine learning, while others were designed specifically for RL. The main objective of this paper is to show and explain RL interpretation methods, the metrics used to classify them, and how these metrics were applied to understand the internal details of RL models. We reviewed papers that propose new RL interpretation methods, improve the old ones, or discuss the pros and cons of the existing methods.

AB  - Background Wide-ranging concerns exist regarding the use of black-box modelling methods in sensitive contexts such as healthcare. Despite performance gains and hype, uptake of artificial intelligence (AI) is hindered by these concerns. Explainable AI is thought to help alleviate these concerns. However, existing definitions for explainable are not forming a solid foundation for this work. Methods We critique recent reviews on the literature regarding: the agency of an AI within a team; mental models, especially as they apply to healthcare, and the practical aspects of their elicitation; and existing and current definitions of explainability, especially from the perspective of AI researchers. On the basis of this literature, we create a new definition of explainable, and supporting terms, providing definitions that can be objectively evaluated. Finally, we apply the new definition of explainable to three existing models, demonstrating how it can apply to previous research, and providing guidance for future research on the basis of this definition. Results Existing definitions of explanation are premised on global applicability and don't address the question 'understandable by whom?'. Eliciting mental models can be likened to creating explainable AI if one considers the AI as a member of a team. On this basis, we define explainability in terms of the context of the model, comprising the purpose, audience, and language of the model and explanation. As examples, this definition is applied to regression models, neural nets, and human mental models in operating-room teams. Conclusions Existing definitions of explanation have limitations for ensuring that the concerns for practical applications are resolved. Defining explainability in terms of the context of their application forces evaluations to be aligned with the practical goals of the model. Further, it will allow researchers to explicitly distinguish between explanations for technical and lay audiences, allowing different evaluations to be applied to each.

AB  - Objective: Large language models constitute a breakthrough state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence technology which is rapidly evolving and promises to aid in medical diagnosis. In this study, we propose a novel evaluation framework for extraction of fine-tuning requirements based on the Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCE) that can increase LLM potential and applicability. Methods: We developed an OSCE based evaluation meta-framework leveraging IoT-based data retrieval with a two-step approach designed to analyze and guide improvement of LLMs in multimodal medical diagnosis: (1) structured interaction evaluation and (2) domain-specific analysis of extracted data. Using Image-Metadata Analysis (IMA), Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Knowledge Graphs (KG), this framework identifies image domains, extracts relevant entities, and assesses connections in KGs. These methods collectively reveal areas for improvement, guiding fine-tuning to enhance diagnostic accuracy and contextual understanding in medical applications. Results: Using this paradigm, (1) we evaluate the correctness and accuracy of generated medical diagnosis with publicly available multimodal-multiple-choice-questions in the vast domain of General Pathology and (2) proceed to the domain-specific analysis. We identify and visualize the model performance across specific organs, diseases, and pathological themes, detecting areas of lower accuracy, such as in cardiovascular conditions like atherosclerosis. This targeted approach enables precision-focused fine-tuning, applying additional data to specific weaknesses rather than a broad, generalized tuning across all pathology. Contributions: Our framework's primary contribution is its OSCE-inspired ability to dynamically identify and target under-performing areas within a broad domain, enhancing fine-tuning efficiency and diagnostic accuracy in a resource-effective and iterative manner removing the dependency on bulk adjustments, making it particularly suitable for sensitive applications where precision and resource efficiency are essential, such as in medical diagnostics.

AB  - Aims Accurate and personalized blood glucose prediction is critical for proactive diabetes management. Conventional machine learning (ML) models often struggle to generalize across patients due to individual variability, nonlinear glycemic dynamics, and sparse multimodal input data. This study aims to develop an advanced, interpretable deep learning (DL) framework for patient-specific, policy-aware blood glucose forecasting.Materials and Methods We propose GlucoNet-MM, a novel multimodal DL framework that combines attention-based multi-task learning (MTL) with a Decision Transformer (DT), a reinforcement learning paradigm that frames policy learning as sequence modeling. The model integrates heterogeneous physiological and behavioral data, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), insulin dosage, carbohydrate intake, and physical activity, to capture complex temporal dependencies. The MTL backbone learns shared representations across multiple prediction horizons, while the DT module conditions future glucose predictions on desired glycemic outcomes. Temporal attention visualizations and integrated gradient-based attribution methods are used to provide interpretability, and Monte Carlo dropout is employed for uncertainty quantification.Results GlucoNet-MM was evaluated on two publicly available datasets, BrisT1D and OhioT1DM. The model achieved R2 scores of 0.94 and 0.96 and mean absolute error (MAE) values of 0.031 and 0.027, respectively. These results outperform single-modality and conventional non-adaptive baseline models, demonstrating superior predictive accuracy and generalizability.Conclusion GlucoNet-MM represents a promising step toward intelligent, personalized clinical decision support for diabetes care. Its multimodal design, policy-aware forecasting, and interpretability features enhance both prediction accuracy and clinical trust, enabling proactive glycemic management tailored to individual patient needs.

AB  - Palliative care is an alternative to standard care for gravely ill patients that has demonstrated many clinical benefits in cost-effective interventions. It is expected to grow in demand soon, so it is necessary to detect those patients who may benefit from these programs using a personalised objective criterion at the correct time. Our goal was to develop a responsive and minimalist web application embedding a 1-year mortality explainable predictive model to assess palliative care at bedside consultation. A 1-year mortality predictive model has been trained. We ranked the input variables and evaluated models with an increasing number of variables. We selected the model with the seven most relevant variables. Finally, we created a responsive, minimalist and explainable app to support bedside decision making for older palliative care. The selected variables are age, medication, Charlson, Barthel, urea, RDW-SD and metastatic tumour. The predictive model achieved an AUC ROC of 0.83 [CI: 0.82, 0.84]. A Shapley value graph was used for explainability. The app allows identifying patients in need of palliative care using the bad prognosis criterion, which can be a useful, easy and quick tool to support healthcare professionals in obtaining a fast recommendation in order to allocate health resources efficiently.

AB  - BackgroundGovernments worldwide are facing growing pressure to increase transparency, as citizens demand greater insight into decision-making processes and public spending. An example is the release of open healthcare data to researchers, as healthcare is one of the top economic sectors. Significant information systems development and computational experimentation are required to extract meaning and value from these datasets. We use a large open health dataset provided by the New York State Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) containing 2.3 million de-identified patient records. One of the fields in these records is a patient's length of stay (LoS) in a hospital, which is crucial in estimating healthcare costs and planning hospital capacity for future needs. Hence it would be very beneficial for hospitals to be able to predict the LoS early. The area of machine learning offers a potential solution, which is the focus of the current paper.MethodsWe investigated multiple machine learning techniques including feature engineering, regression, and classification trees to predict the length of stay (LoS) of all the hospital procedures currently available in the dataset. Whereas many researchers focus on LoS prediction for a specific disease, a unique feature of our model is its ability to simultaneously handle 285 diagnosis codes from the Clinical Classification System (CCS). We focused on the interpretability and explainability of input features and the resulting models. We developed separate models for newborns and non-newborns.ResultsThe study yields promising results, demonstrating the effectiveness of machine learning in predicting LoS. The best R2 scores achieved are noteworthy: 0.82 for newborns using linear regression and 0.43 for non-newborns using catboost regression. Focusing on cardiovascular disease refines the predictive capability, achieving an improved R2 score of 0.62. The models not only demonstrate high performance but also provide understandable insights. For instance, birth-weight is employed for predicting LoS in newborns, while diagnostic-related group classification proves valuable for non-newborns.ConclusionOur study showcases the practical utility of machine learning models in predicting LoS during patient admittance. The emphasis on interpretability ensures that the models can be easily comprehended and replicated by other researchers. Healthcare stakeholders, including providers, administrators, and patients, stand to benefit significantly. The findings offer valuable insights for cost estimation and capacity planning, contributing to the overall enhancement of healthcare management and delivery.

AB  - The recent series of innovations in deep learning (DL) have shown enormous potential to impact individuals and society, both positively and negatively. DL models utilizing massive computing power and enormous datasets have significantly outperformed prior historical benchmarks on increasingly difficult, well-defined research tasks across technology domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, and human-computer interactions. However, DL's black-box nature and over-reliance on massive amounts of data condensed into labels and dense representations pose challenges for interpretability and explainability. Furthermore, DLs have not proven their ability to effectively utilize relevant domain knowledge critical to human understanding. This aspect was missing in early data-focused approaches and necessitated knowledge-infused learning (K-iL) to incorporate computational knowledge. This article demonstrates how knowledge, provided as a knowledge graph, is incorporated into DL using K-iL. Through examples from natural language processing applications in healthcare and education, we discuss the utility of K-iL towards interpretability and explainability.

AB  - The combination of "Big Data " and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is frequently promoted as having the potential to deliver valuable health benefits when applied to medical decision-making. However, the responsible adoption of AI-based clinical decision support systems faces several challenges at both the individual and societal level. One of the features that has given rise to particular concern is the issue of explainability, since, if the way an algorithm arrived at a particular output is not known (or knowable) to a physician, this may lead to multiple challenges, including an inability to evaluate the merits of the output. This "opacity " problem has led to questions about whether physicians are justified in relying on the algorithmic output, with some scholars insisting on the centrality of explainability, while others see no reason to require of AI that which is not required of physicians. We consider that there is merit in both views but find that greater nuance is necessary in order to elucidate the underlying function of explainability in clinical practice and, therefore, its relevance in the context of AI for clinical use. In this paper, we explore explainability by examining what it requires in clinical medicine and draw a distinction between the function of explainability for the current patient versus the future patient. This distinction has implications for what explainability requires in the short and long term. We highlight the role of transparency in explainability, and identify semantic transparency as fundamental to the issue of explainability itself. We argue that, in day-to-day clinical practice, accuracy is sufficient as an "epistemic warrant " for clinical decision-making, and that the most compelling reason for requiring explainability in the sense of scientific or causal explanation is the potential for improving future care by building a more robust model of the world. We identify the goal of clinical decision-making as being to deliver the best possible outcome as often as possible, and find-that accuracy is sufficient justification for intervention for today's patient, as long as efforts to uncover scientific explanations continue to improve healthcare for future patients.

AB  - Accurate segmentation of lung tumors is essential for advancing personalized medicine in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, stage IV NSCLC presents significant challenges due to heterogeneous tumor morphology and the presence of associated conditions including infection, atelectasis and pleural effusion. The complexity of multicentric datasets further complicates robust segmentation across diverse clinical settings. In this study, we evaluate deep-learning-based approaches for automated segmentation of advanced-stage lung tumors using 3D architectures on 387 CT scans from the Deep-Lung-IV study. Through comprehensive experiments, we assess the impact of model design, HU windowing, and dataset size on delineation performance, providing practical guidelines for robust implementation. Additionally, we propose a confidence score using deep ensembles to quantify prediction uncertainty and automate the identification of complex cases that require further review. Our results demonstrate the potential of attention-based architectures and specific preprocessing strategies to improve segmentation quality in such a challenging clinical scenario, while emphasizing the importance of uncertainty estimation to build trustworthy AI systems in medical imaging.

AB  - A model's interpretability is essential to many practical applications such as clinical decision support systems. In this article, a novel interpretable machine learning method is presented, which can model the relationship between input variables and responses in humanly understandable rules. The method is built by applying tropical geometry to fuzzy inference systems, wherein variable encoding functions and salient rules can be discovered by supervised learning. Experiments using synthetic datasets were conducted to demonstrate the performance and capacity of the proposed algorithm in classification and rule discovery. Furthermore, we present a pilot application in identifying heart failure patients that are eligible for advanced therapies as proof of principle. From our results on this particular application, the proposed network achieves the highest F1 score. The network is capable of learning rules that can be interpreted and used by clinical providers. In addition, existing fuzzy domain knowledge can be easily transferred into the network and facilitate model training. In our application, with the existing knowledge, the F1 score was improved by over 5%. The characteristics of the proposed network make it promising in applications requiring model reliability and justification.

AB  - Lung cancer, the second most prevalent and lethal cancer, is caused by aberrant and uncontrolled cell division in the lungs. Once lung cancer spreads to surrounding tissues or organs, the likelihood of recovery declines; hence, early illness detection is vital. Machine learning has shown significant potential in several healthcare applications. Examining various factors and trends in the data, the machine learning model can predict lung cancer menace by pinpointing those more susceptible to the illness. Among the various causes of lung cancer, pesticide is a major contributor. 'Pesticide' refers to any chemical used in agriculture to manage pests like weeds and insects. Numerous health hazards, including the possibility of developing cancer, have been linked to exposure to specific pesticides. Our objective is to obtain the trust of medical professionals and patients depending on how interpretable machine learning models are in healthcare. This paper deals with implementing the proposed study by utilizing a public dataset from a Thai case study to predict the risk of lung cancer caused by pesticide exposure. Since the dataset was highly imbalanced, a hybrid normalization technique was utilized, combining the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and Edited Nearest Neighbor (ENN). We applied a two-stage feature selection technique combined with Extra Tree Classifier and Principal Component Analysis. An eXplainable XGBoost Classifier is developed to predict lung cancer risk based on pesticide exposure. The robustness of the model is reflected in the results, with accuracy, sensitivity, and F1-Score as 99.00%, 98.87%, and 98.57%, respectively. Two public datasets were utilized to generalize the model, and the model performed well on both datasets. The model achieved accuracy, sensitivity, and F1-Score of 99.00%, 99.00%, and 99.33% on the 'Lung Cancer Prediction' dataset. The model is trained and tested on the 'survey lung cancer' dataset and obtained an accuracy, sensitivity, and F1-Score of 99.00%, 99.00%, 99.00%, respectively. The proposed model outperformed existing state-ofthe-art methodologies regarding quality metrics. An illustration is done on the XAI (eXplainable Artificial Intelligence) model by utilizing SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), thereby identifying the most relevant features contributing to the lung cancer menace.

AB  - The progress of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) and mobile technologies is a crucial driver for the evolution of healthcare systems in the path of prevention, early diagnosis and care, consequently unleashing the full potential of medical devices. Especially in intensive care, several vital signs can be monitored to provide an Early Warning Score (EWS) useful to detect the onset of pathological events or severe conditions. However, under these conditions, it would be beneficial to design a system that can provide a risk assessment even in the presence of a reduced number of vital signs. In this work, we propose an on-edge system, connected to one or more wearable medical devices, that is able to collect, analyze and interpret real-time clinical parameters and to provide an EWS-like clinical risk measurement. The system shows an evolutionary behavior by dividing the learning problem in two simpler ones, in order to correctly distinguish between low-urgency and emergency scenarios, with the possibility of selecting the most convenient configuration able to choose the most appropriate classifier even when the feature set does not allow a robust model selection. In particular, we focus on a comparative analysis of machine learning (ML) methods in different conditions of available vital parameter sets, evolving therefore to an adaptive ML approach. Moreover, since from the integration of artificial intelligence tools and IoMT, emerging ethical issues may arise about lack of transparency, a semantic-based explanation is associated to enrich the predictions along with the health data by means of Semantic Web technologies.

AB  - Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is the most common and insidious microvascular complication of diabetes, and can progress asymptomatically until a sudden loss of vision occurs. Although DR is prevalent nowadays, its prevention remains challenging. The multiple aim of this study was to predict the risk of developing DR as diabetic complication (task 1) and, subsequently, temporally stratify the DR risk (task 2) using electronic health records data. To perform these objectives, a novel preprocessing procedure was designed to select both control and pathological patients, and moreover, a novel fully annotated/standardized 120K dataset from multiple diabetologic centers was provided. Globally, although the Extreme Gradient Boosting model offers satisfying predictive performance, the Random Forest model obtained the best predictive performance to solve task 1 and task 2, reaching the best Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve of 72.43 % and 84.38 %, respectively. Also the features importance extracted from the best Machine Learning (ML) models is provided. The proposed Artificial Intelligence-based solution was proven to be capable of generalizing across different diabetologic centers while ensuring high-interpretability. Moreover, the proposed ML solution is currently being adopted as a Clinical Decision Support System in several diabetologic centers for DR screening and follow-up purposes.

AB  - The objective of explainable artificial intelligence systems designed for clinical decision support (XAI-CDSS) is to enhance physicians' diagnostic performance, confidence and trust through the implementation of interpretable methods, thus providing for a superior epistemic positioning, a robust foundation for critical reflection and trustworthiness in times of heightened technological dependence. However, recent studies have revealed shortcomings in achieving these goals, questioning the widespread endorsement of XAI by medical professionals, ethicists and policy-makers alike. Based on a surgical use case, this article challenges generalising calls for XAI-CDSS and emphasises the significance of time-sensitive clinical environments which frequently preclude adequate consideration of system explanations. Therefore, XAI-CDSS may not be able to meet expectations of augmenting clinical decision-making in specific circumstances where time is of the essence. This article, by employing a principled ethical balancing methodology, highlights several fallacies associated with XAI deployment in time-sensitive clinical situations and recommends XAI endorsement only where scientific evidence or stakeholder assessments do not contradict such deployment in specific target settings.

AB  - Automated brain tumor recognition is crucial for swift diagnosis and treatment in healthcare, enhancing patient survival rates but manual recognition of tumor types is time-consuming and resource-intensive. Over the past few years, researchers have proposed various Deep Learning (DL) methods to automate the recognition process over the past years. However, these approaches often lack convincing accuracy and rely on datasets consisting of limited samples, raising concerns regarding real-world efficacy and reliability. Furthermore, the decisions made by black-box AI models in healthcare, where lives are at stake, require proper decision explainability. To address these issues, we propose a robust and explainable deep CNN-based method for effective recognition of brain tumor types, attaining state-of-the-art accuracies of 99.81%, 99.55%, and 99.30% on the training, validation, and test sets, respectively, surpassing both the previous works and baseline models. Moreover, we employed three Explainable AI techniques: Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, and Score-CAM for explainability analysis, contributing towards the development of trustworthy and reliable automation of healthcare diagnosis.

AB  - Machine learning and explainable AI techniques are powerful mechanisms to analyze the influence of unhealthy food advertisements on health awareness and concern levels. This research aims to predict levels of concern about unhealthy food advertisements and identify significant demographic and behavioral variables that modify the need for these concerns. A survey was conducted, and responses from 1030 adolescents were gathered on their knowledge about food advertisements and what affects their perceptions of health. Stacking Ensemble, Random Forest, and XGBoost with hyperparameter optimization and synthetic oversampling techniques were applied to predict three categories of concern levels in unhealthy food advertisements. Stacking Ensemble, utilizing Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machines as base learners and Logistic Regression as the meta-learner, yielded the highest prediction accuracy of 98.54% and an F1 score of 0.99. The most relevant features for predicting the food advertisement concern levels were age, parental education and advertisement types, such as free toys and celebrity endorsement. LIME and SHAP-integrated interpretability methods have been utilized for a proper understanding of how advertisement strategies influence adolescent health awareness. The developments resulted from growing research efforts in which predictive analytics is connected to explainability in understanding and mitigating the adverse influence of unhealthy food advertisements. The results bear implications for public health policies, advertising regulations, and educational campaigns moving against improved adolescent dietary behaviors and awareness.

AB  - Traditional health systems mostly rely on rules created by experts to offer adaptive interventions to patients. However, with recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques, health-related systems are becoming more sophisticated with higher accuracy in providing more personalized interventions or treatments to individual patients. In this paper, we present an extensive literature review to explore the current trends in ML-based adaptive systems for health and well-being. We conduct a systematic search for articles published between January 2011 and April 2022 and selected 87 articles that met our inclusion criteria for review. The selected articles target 18 health and wellness domains including disease management, assistive healthcare, medical diagnosis, mental health, physical activity, dietary management, health monitoring, substance use, smoking cessation, homeopathy remedy finding, patient privacy, mobile health (mHealth) apps finder, clinician knowledge representation for neonatal emergency care, dental and oral health, medication management, disease surveillance, medical specialty recommendation, and health awareness. Our review focuses on five key areas across the target domains: data collection strategies, model development process, ML techniques utilized, model evaluation techniques, as well as adaptive or personalization strategies for health and wellness interventions. We also identified various technical and methodological challenges including data volume constraints, data quality issues, data diversity or variability issues, infrastructure-related issues, and suitability of interventions which offer directions for future work in this area. Finally, we offer recommendations for tackling these challenges, leveraging on technological advances such as multimodality, Cloud technology, online learning, edge computing, automatic re-calibration, Bluetooth auto-reconnection, feedback pipeline, federated learning, explainable AI, and co-creation of health and wellness interventions.

AB  - Multi-state processes (Webster, 2019) are commonly used to model the complex clinical evolution of diseases where patients progress through different states. In recent years, machine learning and deep learning algorithms have been proposed to improve the accuracy of these models' predictions (Wang et al., 2019). However, acceptability by patients and clinicians, as well as for regulatory compliance, require interpretability of these algorithms's predictions. Existing methods, such as the Permutation Feature Importance algorithm, have been adapted for interpreting predictions in black-box models for 2-state processes (corresponding to survival analysis). For generalizing these methods to multi-state models, we introduce a novel model-agnostic interpretability algorithm called Multi-State Counterfactual Perturbation Feature Importance (MS-CPFI) that computes feature importance scores for each transition of a general multi-state model, including survival, competing-risks, and illness-death models. MS-CPFI uses a new counterfactual perturbation method that allows interpreting feature effects while capturing the non-linear effects and potentially capturing time-dependent effects. Experimental results on simulations show that MS-CPFI increases model interpretability in the case of non-linear effects. Additionally, results on a real-world dataset for patients with breast cancer confirm that MSCPFI can detect clinically important features and provide information on the disease progression by displaying features that are protective factors versus features that are risk factors for each stage of the disease. Overall, MS-CPFI is a promising model-agnostic interpretability algorithm for multi-state models, which can improve the interpretability of machine learning and deep learning algorithms in healthcare.

AB  - Deep learning architectures like ResNet and Inception have produced accurate predictions for classifying benign and malignant tumors in the healthcare domain. This enables healthcare institutions to make data-driven decisions and potentially enable early detection of malignancy by employing computer-vision-based deep learning algorithms. These CNN algorithms, in addition to requiring huge amounts of data, can identify higher- and lower-level features that are significant while classifying tumors into benign or malignant. However, the existing literature is limited in terms of the explainability of the resultant classification, and identifying the exact features that are of importance, which is essential in the decision-making process for healthcare practitioners. Thus, the motivation of this work is to implement a custom classifier on the ovarian tumor dataset, which exhibits high classification performance and subsequently interpret the classification results qualitatively, using various Explainable AI methods, to identify which pixels or regions of interest are given highest importance by the model for classification. The dataset comprises CT scanned images of ovarian tumors taken from to the axial, saggital and coronal planes. State-of-the-art architectures, including a modified ResNet50 derived from the standard pre-trained ResNet50, are implemented in the paper. When compared to the existing state-of-the-art techniques, the proposed modified ResNet50 exhibited a classification accuracy of 97.5 % on the test dataset without increasing the the complexity of the architecture. The results then were carried for interpretation using several explainable AI techniques. The results show that the shape and localized nature of the tumors play important roles for qualitatively determining the ability of the tumor to metastasize and thereafter to be classified as benign or malignant.

AB  - Common Audiological Functional Parameters (CAFPAs) were previously introduced as abstract, measurement-independent representation of audiological knowledge, and expert-estimated CAFPAs were shown to be applicable as an interpretable intermediate layer in a clinical decision support system (CDSS). Prediction models for CAFPAs were built based on expert knowledge and one audiological database to allow for data-driven estimation of CAFPAs for new, individual patients for whom no expert-estimated CAFPAs are available. Based on the combination of these components, the current study explores the feasibility of constructing a CDSS which is as interpretable as expert knowledge-based classification and as data-driven as machine learning-based classification. To test this hypothesis, the current study investigated the equivalence in performance of predicted CAFPAs compared to expert-estimated CAFPAs in an audiological classification task, analyzed the importance of different CAFPAs for high and comparable performance, and derived explanations for differences in classified categories. Results show that the combination of predicted CAFPAs and statistical classification enables to build an interpretable but data-driven CDSS. The classification provides good accuracy, with most categories being correctly classified, while some confusions can be explained by the properties of the employed database. This could be improved by including additional databases in the CDSS, which is possible within the presented framework.

AB  - The analytes qualified as biomarkers are potent tools to diagnose various diseases, monitor therapy responses, and design therapeutic interventions. The early assessment of the diverseness of human disease is essential for the speedy and cost-efficient implementation of personalized medicine. We developed g3mclass, the Gaussian mixture modeling software for molecular assay data classification. This software automates the validated multiclass classifier applicable to single analyte tests and multiplexing assays. The g3mclass achieves automation using the original semi-constrained expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm that allows inference from the test, control, and query data that human experts cannot interpret. In this study, we used real-world clinical data and gene expression datasets (ERBB2, ESR1, PGR) to provide examples of how g3mclass may help overcome the problems of over-/underdiagnosis and equivocal results in diagnostic tests for breast cancer. We showed the g3mclass output's accuracy, robustness, scalability, and interpretability. The user-friendly interface and free dissemination of this multi-platform software aim to ease its use by research laboratories, biomedical pharma, companion diagnostic developers, and healthcare regulators. Furthermore, the g3mclass automatic extracting information through probabilistic modeling is adaptable for blending with machine learning and artificial intelligence.

TI  - Non-task expert physicians benefit from correct explainable AI advice when reviewing X-rays
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA  - English
KW  - ALGORITHM
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI)-generated clinical advice is becoming more prevalent in healthcare. However, the impact of AI-generated advice on physicians' decision-making is underexplored. In this study, physicians received X-rays with correct diagnostic advice and were asked to make a diagnosis, rate the advice's quality, and judge their own confidence. We manipulated whether the advice came with or without a visual annotation on the X-rays, and whether it was labeled as coming from an AI or a human radiologist. Overall, receiving annotated advice from an AI resulted in the highest diagnostic accuracy. Physicians rated the quality of AI advice higher than human advice. We did not find a strong effect of either manipulation on participants' confidence. The magnitude of the effects varied between task experts and non-task experts, with the latter benefiting considerably from correct explainable AI advice. These findings raise important considerations for the deployment of diagnostic advice in healthcare.

AB  - Evaluating the rehabilitation status of individuals with serious mental illnesses (SMI) necessitates a comprehensive analysis of multimodal data, including unstructured text records and structured diagnostic data. However, progress in the effective assessment of rehabilitation status remains limited. Our study develops a deep learning model integrating Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and TabNet through a late fusion strategy to enhance rehabilitation prediction, including referral risk, dangerous behaviors, self-awareness, and medication adherence, in patients with SMI. BERT processes unstructured textual data, such as doctor's notes, whereas TabNet manages structured diagnostic information. The model's interpretability function serves to assist healthcare professionals in understanding the model's predictive decisions, improving patient care. Our model exhibited excellent predictive performance for all four tasks, with an accuracy exceeding 0.78 and an area under the curve of 0.70. In addition, a series of tests proved the model's robustness, fairness, and interpretability. This study combines multimodal and multitask learning strategies into a model and applies it to rehabilitation assessment tasks, offering a promising new tool that can be seamlessly integrated with the clinical workflow to support the provision of optimized patient care.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) enabled IoT is a significant paradigm that has been proliferating to new heights in recent years. IoT is a smart technology in which the physical objects or the things that are ubiquitously around us are networked and linked to the internet to deliver new services and enhance efficiency. The primary objective of the IoT is to connect all the physical objects or the things of the world under a common infrastructure, allowing humans to control them and get timely, frequent updates on their status. These things or devices connected to IoT generate, gather and process a massive volume of binary data. This massive volume of data generated from these devices is analyzed and learned by AI algorithms and techniques that aid in providing users with better services. Thus, AI-enabled IoT or artificial IoT (AIoT) is a hybrid technology that merges AI with IoT and is capable of simplifying complicated and strenuous tasks with ease and efficiency. The various machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms in IoT are necessary to ensure the IoT network's improved security and confidentiality. Furthermore, this paper also surveys the various architectures that form the backbone of IoT and AIoT. Moreover, the myriad state-of-the-art ML and DL-based approaches for securing IoT, including detecting anomalies/intrusions, authentication and access control, attack detection and mitigation, preventing distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, and analyzing malware in IoT, are also enlightened. In addition, this work also reviews the role of AIoT in optimizing network efficiency, securing IoT infrastructures, and addressing key challenges. Furthermore, it explores cutting-edge technologies like blockchain, 6G-enabled AIoT, federated learning (FL), and hyperdimensional (HD) computing, indicating their potential in advancing IoT and AIoT-driven applications within sectors like healthcare, autonomous systems, and industrial automation. Therefore, based on the plethora of prevailing significant works, the objective of this manuscript is to provide a comprehensive survey that expounds on AIoT in terms of security, architecture, applications, emerging technologies, and challenges.

AB  - Breast cancer is the most common malignancy diagnosed in women worldwide. The prevalence and incidence of breast cancer is increasing every year; therefore, early diagnosis along with suitable relapse detection is an important strategy for prognosis improvement. This study aimed to compare different machine algorithms to select the best model for predicting breast cancer recurrence. The prediction model was developed by using eleven different machine learning (ML) algorithms, including logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), support vector classification (SVC), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), decision tree, multilayer perceptron (MLP), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), Gaussian naive Bayes (GaussianNB), and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), to predict breast cancer recurrence. The area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and F1 score were used to evaluate the performance of the prognostic model. Based on performance, the optimal ML was selected, and feature importance was ranked by Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) values. Compared to the other 10 algorithms, the results showed that the AdaBoost algorithm had the best prediction performance for successfully predicting breast cancer recurrence and was adopted in the establishment of the prediction model. Moreover, CA125, CEA, Fbg, and tumor diameter were found to be the most important features in our dataset to predict breast cancer recurrence. More importantly, our study is the first to use the SHAP method to improve the interpretability of clinicians to predict the recurrence model of breast cancer based on the AdaBoost algorithm. The AdaBoost algorithm offers a clinical decision support model and successfully identifies the recurrence of breast cancer.

AB  - Society 5.0 envisions a human-centered society where advanced technologies seamlessly integrate to enhance quality of life, particularly in healthcare. To advance eHealth within this vision, we present a comprehensive framework that integrates the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), edge computing, and cloud services with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and blockchain technology, customized for the 6G era. We introduce the Health Prediction using Cloud Edge 2.0 (HPCE 2.0) algorithm, which employs fuzzy logic to effectively combine historical Electronic Health Records (EHRs) with real-time IoMT data, providing precise and personalized health severity level predictions. To ensure data integrity and security, we integrate the Proof of Authentication 2.0 (PoAh 2.0) consensus mechanism within a blockchain-enhanced IoMT-Edge-Cloud framework. A case study on predicting cardiac arrest in elderly patients demonstrates the practical effectiveness of our framework. Utilizing XAI models such as LIME and SHAP, we provide both local and global explanations for AI predictions, enhancing transparency and trust in healthcare applications; counterfactual explanations offer actionable insights for patients to proactively manage health risks. Security assessments confirm efficient block formation and verification times, validating the system's scalability and compliance with stringent security standards. This work sets a new standard in digital healthcare by aligning technological advancements with ethical considerations, fostering a human-centered approach consistent with Society 5.0's vision. Harnessing the capabilities of emerging 6G networks, our framework paves the way for more responsive, secure, and interpretable AI-driven healthcare solutions.

AB  - Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the leading cause of preventable death in hospitalized patients. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) can support guidelines recommending an individualized approach to risk assessment and prophylaxis. We conducted electronic surveys asking clinician and healthcare informaticians about their perspectives on AI/ML for VTE prevention and management. Of 101 respondents to the informatician survey, most were 40 years or older, male, clinicians and data scientists, and had performed research on AI/ML. Of the 607 US-based respondents to the clinician survey, most were 40 years or younger, female, physicians, and had never used AI to inform clinical practice. Most informaticians agreed that AI/ML can be used to manage VTE (56.0%). Over one-third were concerned that clinicians would not use the technology (38.9%), but the majority of clinicians believed that AI/ML probably or definitely can help with VTE prevention (70.1%). The most common concern in both groups was a perceived lack of transparency (informaticians 54.4%; clinicians 25.4%). These two surveys revealed that key stakeholders are interested in AI/ML for VTE prevention and management, and identified potential barriers to address prior to implementation.

AB  - Background: Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have the potential to play a crucial role in enhancing health care quality by providing evidence-based information to clinicians at the point of care. Despite their increasing popularity, there is a lack of comprehensive research exploring their design characterization and trends. This limits our understanding and ability to optimize their functionality, usability, and adoption in health care settings. Objective: This systematic review examined the design characteristics of CDSS from a user-centered perspective, focusing on user-centered design (UCD), user experience (UX), and usability, to identify related design challenges and provide insights into the implications for future design of CDSS. Methods: This review followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) recommendations and used a grounded theory analytical approach to guide the conduct, data analysis, and synthesis. A search of 4 major electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and IEEE Xplore) was conducted for papers published between 2013 and 2023, using predefined design-focused keywords (design, UX, implementation, evaluation, usability, and architecture). Papers were included if they focused on a designed CDSS for a health condition and discussed the design and UX aspects (eg, design approach, architecture, or integration). Papers were excluded if they solely covered technical implementation or architecture (eg, machine learning methods) or were editorials, reviews, books, conference abstracts, or study protocols. Results: Out of 1905 initially identified papers, 40 passed screening and eligibility checks for a full review and analysis. Analysis of the studies revealed that UCD is the most widely adopted approach for designing CDSS, with all design processes incorporating functional or usability evaluation mechanisms. The CDSS reported were mainly clinician-facing and mostly stand-alone systems, with their design lacking consideration for integration with existing clinical information systems and workflows. Through a UCD lens, four key categories of challenges relevant to CDSS design were identified: (1) usability and UX, (2) validity and reliability, (3) data quality and assurance, and (4) design and integration complexities. Notably, a subset of studies incorporating Explainable artificial intelligence highlighted its emerging role in addressing key challenges related to validity and reliability by fostering explainability, transparency, and trust in CDSS recommendations, while also supporting collaborative validation with users. Conclusions: While CDSS show promise in enhancing health care delivery, identified challenges have implications for their future design, efficacy, and utilization. Adopting pragmatic UCD design approaches that actively involve users is essential for enhancing usability and addressing identified UX challenges. Integrating with clinical systems is crucial for interoperability and presents opportunities for AI-enabled CDSS that rely on large patient data. Incorporating emerging technologies such as Explainable Artificial Intelligence can boost trust and acceptance. Enabling functionality for CDSS to support both clinicians and patients can create opportunities for effective use in virtual care.

AB  - Recent advancements in computing have led to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) enabled healthcare technologies. AI-assisted clinical decision support (CDS) integrated into electronic health records (EHR) was demonstrated to have a significant potential to improve clinical care. With the rapid proliferation of AI-assisted CDS, came the realization that a lack of careful consideration of socio-technical issues surrounding the implementation and maintenance of these tools can result in unanticipated consequences, missed opportunities, and suboptimal uptake of these potentially useful technologies. The 48-h Discharge Prediction Tool (48DPT) is a new AI-assisted EHR CDS to facilitate discharge planning. This study aimed to methodologically assess the implementation of 48DPT and identify the barriers and facilitators of adoption and maintenance using the validated implementation science frameworks. The major dimensions of RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) and the constructs of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) frameworks have been used to analyze interviews of 24 key stakeholders using 48DPT. The systematic assessment of the 48DPT implementation allowed us to describe facilitators and barriers to implementation such as lack of awareness, lack of accuracy and trust, limited accessibility, and transparency. Based on our evaluation, the factors that are crucial for the successful implementation of AI-assisted EHR CDS were identified. Future implementation efforts of AI-assisted EHR CDS should engage the key clinical stakeholders in the AI tool development from the very inception of the project, support transparency and explainability of the AI models, provide ongoing education and onboarding of the clinical users, and obtain continuous input from clinical staff on the CDS performance.

AB  - Background Several studies highlight the effects of artificial intelligence (AI) systems on healthcare delivery. AI-based tools may improve prognosis, diagnostics, and care planning. It is believed that AI will be an integral part of healthcare services in the near future and will be incorporated into several aspects of clinical care. Thus, many technology companies and governmental projects have invested in producing AI-based clinical tools and medical applications. Patients can be one of the most important beneficiaries and users of AI-based applications whose perceptions may affect the widespread use of AI-based tools. Patients should be ensured that they will not be harmed by AI-based devices, and instead, they will be benefited by using AI technology for healthcare purposes. Although AI can enhance healthcare outcomes, possible dimensions of concerns and risks should be addressed before its integration with routine clinical care. Methods We develop a model mainly based on value perceptions due to the specificity of the healthcare field. This study aims at examining the perceived benefits and risks of AI medical devices with clinical decision support (CDS) features from consumers' perspectives. We use an online survey to collect data from 307 individuals in the United States. Results The proposed model identifies the sources of motivation and pressure for patients in the development of AI-based devices. The results show that technological, ethical (trust factors), and regulatory concerns significantly contribute to the perceived risks of using AI applications in healthcare. Of the three categories, technological concerns (i.e., performance and communication feature) are found to be the most significant predictors of risk beliefs. Conclusions This study sheds more light on factors affecting perceived risks and proposes some recommendations on how to practically reduce these concerns. The findings of this study provide implications for research and practice in the area of AI-based CDS. Regulatory agencies, in cooperation with healthcare institutions, should establish normative standard and evaluation guidelines for the implementation and use of AI in healthcare. Regular audits and ongoing monitoring and reporting systems can be used to continuously evaluate the safety, quality, transparency, and ethical factors of AI-based services.

AB  - The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has generated significant enthusiasm within healthcare, especially in supporting clinical decision-making and patient management. However, inherent limitations including hallucinations, outdated clinical context, and unreliable references pose serious concerns for their clinical utility. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models address these limitations by integrating validated, curated medical literature directly into AI workflows, significantly enhancing the accuracy, relevance, and transparency of generated outputs. This viewpoint discusses how RAG frameworks can specifically benefit plastic and reconstructive surgery by providing contextually accurate, evidence-based, and clinically grounded support for decision-making. Potential clinical applications include clinical decision support, efficient evidence synthesis, customizable patient education, informed consent materials, multilingual capabilities, and structured surgical documentation. By querying specialized databases that incorporate contemporary guidelines and literature, RAG models can markedly reduce inaccuracies and increase the reliability of AI-generated responses. However, the implementation of RAG technology demands rigorous database curation, regular updating with guidelines from surgical societies, and ongoing validation to maintain clinical relevance. Addressing challenges related to data privacy, governance, ethical considerations, and user training remains critical for successful clinical adoption. In conclusion, RAG models represent a significant advancement in overcoming traditional LLM limitations, promoting transparency and clinical accuracy with great potential for plastic surgery. Plastic surgeons and researchers are encouraged to explore and integrate these innovative generative AI frameworks to enhance patient care, surgical outcomes, communication, documentation quality, and education.(c) 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - Mortality prediction plays a crucial role in healthcare by supporting informed decision-making for both public and personal health management. This study uses novel data sources such as wearable activity tracking devices, combined with explainable artificial intelligence methods, to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of mortality predictions. By using data from the UK Biobank-specifically wrist-worn accelerometer data, hospital records, and various demographic and lifestyle factors, and health-related factors-this research uncovers new insights into the predictors of mortality. Explainable artificial intelligence techniques are employed to make the models' predictions more transparent and understandable, thereby improving their practical applications in healthcare decisions. Our analysis shows that random forest models achieve the highest prediction accuracy, with an area under the curve score of 0.78. Key predictors of mortality include age, physical activity levels captured by accelerometers, and other health and lifestyle factors. The study also identifies non-linear relationships between these predictors and mortality, and provides detailed explanations for individual-level predictions, offering deeper insights into risk factors.

AB  - Recent advancements in machine learning have opened new avenues for preventing fatal ventricular arrhythmia by accurately measuring and analyzing QT intervals. This paper presents virtual sensor based on an expert system designed to prevent the risk of fatal ventricular arrhythmias associated with QT-prolonging treatments. The expert system categorizes patients into three risk levels based on their electrocardiogram-derived QT intervals and other clinical data, such as age or sex, facilitating informed decision-making and reducing the workload for healthcare professionals. Expert systems, known for their effectiveness in classifications with limited data, are particularly advantageous in this context. They not only achieve better standard metrics but also offer interpretability that other machine learning models lack. The proposed system's performance has been rigorously compared against various machine learning algorithms, demonstrating superior efficiency as evidenced by confusion matrices, standard classification metrics, and receiver operation point curves. With an accuracy of 96.5%, the expert system proves to be the best option among the models evaluated, optimizing patient care and treatment outcomes by enabling more frequent and precise electrocardiogram assessments.

AB  - The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has revolutionized healthcare, but its vulnerabilities demand robust security solutions, especially for resource-constrained devices. In this research, we introduce an innovative Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)-based intrusion detection system (IDS) designed specifically for the unique challenges of IoMT, deploying at the edge for enhanced efficiency. Our proposed IDS incorporates a multifaceted approach: first, it leverages the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm for feature engineering, optimizing data representation to reduce computational overhead on resource-constrained devices. Second, a diverse ensemble of machine learning and deep learning models is employed to detect a wide array of intrusion attempts within IoMT networks. Third, interpretation is achieved using Shapley additive explanations (SHAPs), providing transparency and understanding of the decision-making process. By combining intelligence, efficiency, explainability, and deploying as a SaaS solution at the network edge, our IDS not only improves the security of resource-constrained IoMT devices but also empowers healthcare professionals with actionable insights, ensuring patient data privacy and network integrity in this dynamic and critical domain. Finally, the results using a publicly available healthcare data set, namely, WUSTL-EHMS-2020 proves the effectiveness of the proposed IDS over some recent state-of-the-art works.

AB  - We are witnessing a widespread adoption of artificial intelligence in healthcare. However, most of the advancements in deep learning in this area consider only unimodal data, neglecting other modalities. Their multimodal interpretation necessary for supporting diagnosis, prognosis and treatment decisions. In this work we present a deep architecture, which jointly learns modality reconstructions and sample classifications using tabular and imaging data. The explanation of the decision taken is computed by applying a latent shift that, simulates a counterfactual prediction revealing the features of each modality that contribute the most to the decision and a quantitative score indicating the modality importance. We validate our approach in the context of COVID-19 pandemic using the AIforCOVID dataset, which contains multimodal data for the early identification of patients at risk of severe outcome. The results show that the proposed method provides meaningful explanations without degrading the classification performance.

KW  - AI
AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been among the most emerging research and industrial application fields, especially in the healthcare domain, but operated as a black-box model with a limited understanding of its inner working over the past decades. AI algorithms are, in large part, built on weights calculated as a result of large matrix multiplications. It is typically hard to interpret and debug the computationally intensive processes. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to solve black-box and hard-to-debug approaches through the use of various techniques and tools. In this study, XAI techniques are applied to chronic wound classification. The proposed model classifies chronic wounds through the use of transfer learning and fully connected layers. Classified chronic wound images serve as input to the XAI model for an explanation. Interpretable results can help shed new perspectives to clinicians during the diagnostic phase. The proposed method successfully provides chronic wound classification and its associated explanation to extract additional knowledge that can also be interpreted by non-data-science experts, such as medical scientists and physicians. This hybrid approach is shown to aid with the interpretation and understanding of AI decision-making processes.

AB  - In line with recent advances in neural drug design and sensitivity prediction, we propose a novel architecture for interpretable prediction of anticancer compound sensitivity using a multimodal attention-based convolutional encoder. Our model is based on the three key pillars of drug sensitivity: compounds' structure in the form of a SMILES sequence, gene expression profiles of tumors, and prior knowledge on intracellular interactions from protein-protein interaction networks. We demonstrate that our multiscale convolutional attention-based encoder significantly outperforms a baseline model trained on Morgan fingerprints and a selection of encoders based on SMILES, as well as the previously reported state-of-the-art for multimodal drug sensitivity prediction (R-2 = 0.86 and RMSE = 0.89). Moreover, the explainability of our approach is demonstrated by a thorough analysis of the attention weights. We show that the attended genes significantly enrich apoptotic processes and that the drug attention is strongly correlated with a standard chemical structure similarity index. Finally, we report a case study of two receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitors acting on a leukemia cell line, showcasing the ability of the model to focus on informative genes and submolecular regions of the two compounds. The demonstrated generalizability and the interpretability of our model testify to its potential for in silico prediction of anticancer compound efficacy on unseen cancer cells, positioning it as a valid solution for the development of personalized therapies as well as for the evaluation of candidate compounds in de novo drug design.

Steyaert and colleagues discuss the current status and challenges of data fusion, including electronic health records, molecular data, digital pathology and radiographic images, in cancer research and translational development.
   Technological advances have made it possible to study a patient from multiple angles with high-dimensional, high-throughput multiscale biomedical data. In oncology, massive amounts of data are being generated, ranging from molecular, histopathology, radiology to clinical records. The introduction of deep learning has greatly advanced the analysis of biomedical data. However, most approaches focus on single data modalities, leading to slow progress in methods to integrate complementary data types. Development of effective multimodal fusion approaches is becoming increasingly important as a single modality might not be consistent and sufficient to capture the heterogeneity of complex diseases to tailor medical care and improve personalized medicine. Many initiatives now focus on integrating these disparate modalities to unravel the biological processes involved in multifactorial diseases such as cancer. However, many obstacles remain, including lack of usable data as well as methods for clinical validation and interpretation. Here, we cover these current challenges and reflect on opportunities through deep learning to tackle data sparsity and scarcity, multimodal interpretability and standardization of datasets.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming laboratory medicine, impacting medical devices and healthcare practices. Despite these advancements, AI-based medical device software (MDSW) introduces a new layer of complexity in regulatory compliance. This paper outlines the regulatory landscape for MDSW and AI-driven MDSW, clarifying the responsibilities of laboratory professionals and manufacturers under the In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (IVDR), ISO 15189:2022, and the Artificial Intelligence Act. An analysis of 89 MDSWs approved under the IVDR, derived from the European Database on Medical Devices (EUDAMED) reveals a diverse landscape of applications, ranging from digital pathology and molecular diagnostics to laboratory automation and clinical decision support. While Germany currently dominates the EU market for these devices, and the majority of approved MDSW remain non-AI driven and classified as low-risk, the increasing presence of AI-powered Class C devices underscores the growing potential of software in complex diagnostic scenarios. However, realizing the full potential of AI in laboratory medicine requires careful navigation of the evolving regulatory landscape. Key challenges persist, including defining intended use, ensuring robust clinical evidence, mitigating data bias, and establishing rigorous post-market surveillance. Balancing regulatory oversight with innovation is critical to fostering the development of trustworthy AI systems without stifling progress. As regulatory frameworks continue to evolve, establishing clear validation methodologies and transparent compliance pathways will be essential to unlocking the full potential of AI in laboratory medicine while ensuring the highest standards of safety and clinical effectiveness.

AB  - Cesarean Section (C-Section) is an operation whereby a baby is brought to the world through a cut made on the abdomen and uterus. The factors that lead to C-Section includes premature rupture of the membranes, having an abnormal fetal heart rate, having previous C-Sections, or previous surgeries on the uterus, human immunodeficiency virus, having undergone cervical cerclage, or having sustained accidental injuries. If not predicted in the early stages, the mother and especially the baby faces many risks. Timely intervention and monitoring are made possible by early forcasting the mode of delivery. Although Deep Learning (DL) models aid in medical decision making, practitioners continue to have reservations about the accuracy and transparency in identifying important contributing factors. Our study presents an explainable DL system that utilizes a health indicators dataset comprising data gathered in India between 2019 and 2021 to forecast C-Section deliveries in the early stages. In order to solve class imbalance issues, the dataset is preprocessed utilizing encoding of categorical features, Proximity Weighted Synthetic oversampling, and a point biserial correlation coefficient approach to identify the highly correlated 65 features. A number of measures are used to assess the proposed Gated Highway Multi-layer-perceptron (GHiM) model, including accuracy, F1-score, recall, precision, MCC, loss, and execution time. With its accuracy of 0.866, F1-score of 0.863, and MCC of 0.732, the GHiM model outperformed models such as GRU, MLP, and HighwayNet by 2.5-3.5% Due to the complex structure of DL models, they are prone to over-fitting which is mitigated by training the GHiM using stratified 10-fold cross validation. Additionally, the most important characteristics in the categorization of C-Sections and normal births are determined by applying SHapley Additive exPlanation. This framework demonstrates that the GHiM model offers good accuracy and interpretability, and can enhance clinical decision support systems for C-Section delivery forecasting.

AB  - Advancements in machine learning algorithms have had a beneficial impact on representation learning, classification, and prediction models built using electronic health record (EHR) data. Effort has been put both on increasing models' overall performance as well as improving their interpretability, particularly regarding the decision-making process. In this study, we present a temporal deep learning model to perform bidirectional representation learning on EHR sequences with a transformer architecture to predict future diagnosis of depression. This model is able to aggregate five heterogenous and high-dimensional data sources from the EHR and process them in a temporal manner for chronic disease prediction at various prediction windows. We applied the current trend of pretraining and fine-tuning on EHR data to outperform the current state-of-the-art in chronic disease prediction, and to demonstrate the underlying relation between EHR codes in the sequence. The model generated the highest increases of precision-recall area under the curve (PRAUC) from 0.70 to 0.76 in depression prediction compared to the best baseline model. Furthermore, the self-attention weights in each sequence quantitatively demonstrated the inner relationship between various codes, which improved the model's interpretability. These results demonstrate the model's ability to utilize heterogeneous EHR data to predict depression while achieving high accuracy and interpretability, which may facilitate constructing clinical decision support systems in the future for chronic disease screening and early detection.

AB  - This paper proposes an architecture of the system that provides support for collaborative research focused on analysis of data acquired using Triggerfish contact lens sensor and devices for continuous monitoring of cardiovascular system properties. The system enables application of machine learning (ML) models for glaucoma diagnosis without direct intraocular pressure measurement and independently of complex imaging techniques used in clinical practice. We describe development of ML models based on sensor data and measurements of corneal biomechanical properties. Application scenarios involve collection, sharing and analysis of multi-sensor data. We give a view of issues concerning interpretability and evaluation of ML model predictions. We also refer to the problems related to personalized medicine and transdisciplinary research. The system can be a base for community-wide initiative including ophthalmologists, data scientists and machine learning experts that has the potential to leverage data acquired by the devices to understand glaucoma risk factors and the processes related to progression of the disease.

We designed the questions to explore three themes: development and use of AI, professional decision-making, and management and organizational procedures connected to AI. The transcribed interviews were analysed in an iterative coding process from open coding to theoretically informed thematic coding.ResultsWe identified four aspects of trust that relate to reliability, transparency, quality verification, and inter-organizational compatibility. These aspects fall under the categories of substantial and procedural requirements.ConclusionsDevelopment of appropriate levels of trust in AI in healthcare is complex and encompasses multiple dimensions of requirements. Various stakeholders will have to be involved in developing AI solutions for healthcare and radiology to fulfil these requirements.Clinical relevance statementFor AI to achieve advances in radiology, it must be given the opportunity to support, rather than replace, human expertise.

TI  - RETRACTED: Explainable AI in Diagnosing and Anticipating Leukemia Using Transfer Learning Method (Retracted Article)
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
LA  - English
AB  - White blood cells (WBCs) are blood cells that fight infections and diseases as a part of the immune system. They are also known as "defender cells." But the imbalance in the number of WBCs in the blood can be hazardous. Leukemia is the most common blood cancer caused by an overabundance of WBCs in the immune system. Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) usually occurs when the bone marrow creates many immature WBCs that destroy healthy cells. People of all ages, including children and adolescents, can be affected by ALL. The rapid proliferation of atypical lymphocyte cells can cause a reduction in new blood cells and increase the chances of death in patients. Therefore, early and precise cancer detection can help with better therapy and a higher survival probability in the case of leukemia. However, diagnosing ALL is time-consuming and complicated, and manual analysis is expensive, with subjective and error-prone outcomes. Thus, detecting normal and malignant cells reliably and accurately is crucial. For this reason, automatic detection using computer-aided diagnostic models can help doctors effectively detect early leukemia. The entire approach may be automated using image processing techniques, reducing physicians' workload and increasing diagnosis accuracy. The impact of deep learning (DL) on medical research has recently proven quite beneficial, offering new avenues and possibilities in the healthcare domain for diagnostic techniques. However, to make that happen soon in DL, the entire community must overcome the explainability limit. Because of the black box operation's shortcomings in artificial intelligence (AI) models' decisions, there is a lack of liability and trust in the outcomes. But explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) can solve this problem by interpreting the predictions of AI systems. This study emphasizes leukemia, specifically ALL. The proposed strategy recognizes acute lymphoblastic leukemia as an automated procedure that applies different transfer learning models to classify ALL. Hence, using local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) to assure validity and reliability, this method also explains the cause of a specific classification. The proposed method achieved 98.38% accuracy with the InceptionV3 model. Experimental results were found between different transfer learning methods, including ResNet101V2, VGG19, and InceptionResNetV2, later verified with the LIME algorithm for XAI, where the proposed method performed the best. The obtained results and their reliability demonstrate that it can be preferred in identifying ALL, which will assist medical examiners.

AB  - Cancer is a significant health concern globally and its early identification and screening are essential for better patient outcomes. To accurately perform cancer diagnosis and ascertain prognostic as well as therapeutic targets, histopathology images are used. Deep learning techniques have had significant success which has spurred substantial research into, among other cancer illnesses, breast, colon, and lung cancer, but their effectiveness is limited by drawbacks such as the need to select appropriate features, which can be time-consuming and challenging. Furthermore, despite the success of deep learning models, their decisions are opaque. There is a need to understand their decision-making processes. This paper proposes a novel deep-learning model for histopathological medical image classification, specifically breast, colon, and lung cancer analysis based on the various input image characteristics (low-level and high-level features). The BreakHis dataset (Breast Cancer) and LC25000 (Colon and Lung Cancer) are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model. The proposed model's average accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1_score, recall, and precision are 98.00 +/- 0.19 with a specific accuracy of 99.2 % and 99.1 % (BreakHis 4 and 8 classes), 99.9 % and 100 % (LC25000 3 and 2 classes) respectively. In other to interpret the proposed model results, an explainable AI model based on LIME and SHAP is designed for a human-understandable explanation. Furthermore, parameter sensitivity analysis of the proposed model was recorded for both datasets. Results show that the proffered model supersedes the traditional methods that rely only on high-level features with a wide and significant margin as well as highlights its importance for accurate cancer analysis and aiding healthcare practitioners to identify and diagnose cancer at an early stage.

AB  - BackgroundStudies on food craving and consumption often overlook the interconnectedness of risk factors, assuming uniform mechanisms that drive individuals to (over)consume food. This project seeks to address this gap by leveraging a precision health framework to explore whether multimodal clustering can predict weight and eating outcomes after six months, providing a more nuanced understanding of individual variability.MethodsThe project will include a longitudinal study, encompassing several sub-studies where self-report, electrophysiological, and time series dynamic data will be collected at three time points. At baseline, participants will complete comprehensive assessments, including an electroencephalography (EEG) experiment and a one-week experience sampling study (ESM). Machine learning techniques will be employed to uncover distinct participant clusters, characterized by unique patterns of food consumption and weight changes over six months. Markers that best differentiate these profiles will be identified with explainable AI techniques, which aim to make machine learning model outputs understandable by highlighting the key features or patterns driving predictions, enabling personalized insights into key factors contributing to eating behaviors and weight management.DiscussionBy exploring the variability of mechanisms influencing food consumption, eating regulation, and weight gain, we aim to uncover subgroups of individuals who are most affected by specific influences, such as stress, emotion regulation difficulties, or sleep deprivation. This project will advance theoretical understanding by integrating multimodal data and emphasizing idiographic methods to capture individual variability. Findings will provide a foundation for future research on precision approaches to eating behaviors and may offer insights into personalized strategies for prevention and management of both normative and disordered eating patterns.

AB  - In a generic modern multi-antenna relay system, the incremental cooperative networks use the neighbor nodes to assist the source by sending the source message to the destination for achieving spatial diversity. Therefore, the involvement of cyber-physical Systems (CPS) in smart healthcare has proportionately improved in terms of the relaying schemes. These schemes are equally implicated to terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks. For any non-terrestrial-networks (NTN), the computational intelligence in terms of artificial intelligence (AI) plays a viral role, the work have introduced a novel paradigm of NTN applications using Explainable-artificial intelligence (X-AI) approach. Initially, we propose and analyze a new cooperative relaying scheme for the incremental multi-antenna relays system; namely, incremental multi-antenna relays cooperation with a hybrid relaying scheme (IMARC-H). The IMARC-H, either Amplify-and-forward (AF) or Decode-and-forward (DF) uses relaying scheme based on the X-AI approach. Mathematical formulations have been deducted to support an optimal relationship between signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and neighbour nodes in the physical layer. The simulations are presented to showcase the validation of the work. The analysis of the obtained simulation results shows that the proposed scheme outperforms in minimizing Bit-Error-Rate (BER) and outage probability as compared to the existing CPS-based relaying schemes such as IMARC-AF, IMARC-DF, etc.

AB  - BackgroundAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), pneumonia is the leading infectious cause of death in children below 5 years old. Hence, the early detection of pediatric pneumonia is crucial to reduce its morbidity and mortality rates. Even though chest radiography is the most commonly employed modality for pneumonia detection, recent studies highlight the existence of poor interobserver agreement in the chest X-ray interpretation of healthcare practitioners when it comes to diagnosing pediatric pneumonia. Thus, there is a significant need for automating the detection process to minimize the potential human error. Since Artificial Intelligence tools such as Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML) have the potential to automate disease detection, many researchers explored how such tools can be implemented to detect pneumonia in chest X-rays. Notably, the majority of efforts tackled this problem from a DL point of view. However, ML has shown a higher potential for medical interpretability while being less computationally demanding than DL. ObjectiveThe aim of this paper is to automate the early detection process of pediatric pneumonia using ML as it is less computationally demanding than DL. MethodsThe proposed approach entails performing data augmentation to balance the classes of the utilized dataset, optimizing the feature extraction scheme, and evaluating the performance of several ML models. Moreover, the performance of this approach is compared to a TL benchmark to evaluate its candidacy. ResultsUsing the proposed approach, the Quadratic SVM model yielded an accuracy of 97.58%, surpassing the accuracies reported in the current ML literature. In addition, this model classification time was significantly smaller than that of the TL benchmark. ConclusionThe results strongly support the candidacy of the proposed approach in reliably detecting pediatric pneumonia.

AB  - The consumer electronics (CE) industry has greatly benefited from cutting-edge technology such as the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence (AI), Big Data analytics, and edge computing. These new emerging technologies have transformed traditional consumer systems for healthcare into smart, cost-effective, user-friendly, and sustainable consumer healthcare services. However, in such heterogeneous healthcare networks, smart devices generate large amounts of data. As a result, protecting CE and ensuring privacy preservation in healthcare systems remains an ongoing challenge. In this article, we explore the role of edge intelligence in protecting CE for healthcare services. We develop a lightweight and robust detection model using knowledge distillation-based federated learning to safeguard edge devices and ensure the privacy-preserving of consumer technology for healthcare services close to the data source. In addition, explainable AI for federated edge intelligence is used to comprehend and trust the prediction result in consumer technology. Finally, challenges, limitations, and future research are discussed.

AB  - IntroductionDigital Health Technologies (DHTs) are currently being funneled through legacy regulatory processes that are not adapted to the unique particularities of this new technology class. In the absence of adequate regulation of DHTs, the briefing of a patient by their healthcare provider (HCP) as a component of informed consent can present the last line of defense before potentially harmful technologies are employed on a patient. MethodsThis exploratory study utilizes a case vignette of a machine learning-based technology for the diagnosis of ischemic heart disease that is presented to a group of medical students, physicians, and bioethicists. What constitutes the necessary standard and content of the HCP-patient briefings is explored using a survey (N = 34). Whether participants actually provide a sufficient HCP-patient briefing is evaluated based on audio recordings. Results and ConclusionsWe find that participants deem artificial intelligence use in medical context should be declared to patients and argue that the explanation should currently follow the standard required of other experimental procedures. Further, since our study provides indications that implementation of HCP-patient briefings lacks behind the identified standard, opportunities for incorporation of training on the use of DHTs into medical curricula and continuous training schedules should be considered.

AB  - Understanding molecular traits through metabolomics offers an avenue to tailor cardiovascular prevention, diagnosis and treatment strategies more effectively. This study focuses on the application of machine learning (ML) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) algorithms to detect discriminant molecular signatures in heart failure (HF). We aim to uncover metabolites with significant predictive value by analyzing targeted metabolomics data through ML and XAI algorithms. After quality control, we analyzed 55 metabolites from 124 plasma samples, including 53 HF patients and 71 controls, comparing Ridge Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine and eXtreme Gradient Boosting models. All achieved high accuracy in predicting group labels: 84.0% [95% CI: 75.3 - 92.7], 85.73 [95% CI: 78.6 - 92.9], and 84.8% [95% CI: 76.1 - 93.5], respectively. Permutation-based variable importance and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) were used for group-level and individual-level explainability, respectively, complemented by H-Friedman statistics for variable interactions, yielding reliable, explainable insights of the ML models. Metabolites well-known for their association with HF, such as glucose and cholesterol, and more recently described, the C18:1 carnitine, were reaffirmed in our analysis. The novel discovery of lignoceric acid (C24:0 fatty acid) as a critical discriminator, was confirmed in a replication cohort, underscoring its potential as a metabolite marker. Furthermore, our study highlights the utility of 2 way variable interaction analysis in unveiling a network of metabolite interactions essential for accurate disease prediction. The results demonstrate our approach's efficacy in identifying key metabolites and their interactions, illustrating the power of ML and XAI in advancing personalized healthcare solutions.

TI  - ChatExosome: An Artificial Intelligence (AI) Agent Based on Deep Learning of Exosomes Spectroscopy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) Diagnosis
T2  - ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
LA  - English
AB  - Large language models (LLMs) hold significant promise in the field of medical diagnosis. There are still many challenges in the direct diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP) is a commonly used tumor marker for liver cancer. However, relying on AFP can result in missed diagnoses of HCC. We developed an artificial intelligence (AI) agent centered on LLMs, named ChatExosome, which created an interactive and convenient system for clinical spectroscopic analysis and diagnosis. ChatExosome consists of two main components: the first is the deep learning of the Raman fingerprinting of exosomes derived from HCC. Based on a patch-based 1D self-attention mechanism and downsampling, the feature fusion transformer (FFT) was designed to process the Raman spectra of exosomes. It achieved accuracies of 95.8% for cell-derived exosomes and 94.1% for 165 clinical samples, respectively. The second component is the interactive chat agent based on LLM. The retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method was utilized to enhance the knowledge related to exosomes. Overall, LLM serves as the core of this interactive system, which is capable of identifying users' intentions and invoking the appropriate plugins to process the Raman data of exosomes. This is the first AI agent focusing on exosome spectroscopy and diagnosis, enhancing the interpretability of classification results, enabling physicians to leverage cutting-edge medical research and artificial intelligence techniques to optimize medical decision-making processes, and it shows great potential in intelligent diagnosis.

AB  - This study aimed to develop a simple, interpretable model using routinely available data for predicting COVID-19 mortality at admission, addressing limitations of complex models, and to provide a statistically robust framework for controlled clinical use, managing model uncertainty for responsible healthcare application. Data from Belgium's first COVID-19 wave (UZ Brussel, n = 252) were used for model development. External validation utilized data from unvaccinated patients during the late second and early third waves (AZ Delta, n = 175). Various machine learning methods were trained and compared for diagnostic performance after data preprocessing and feature selection. The final model, the M3-score, incorporated three features: age, white blood cell (WBC) count, and AI-derived total lung involvement (TOTALAI) quantified from CT scans using Icolung software. The M3-score demonstrated strong classification performance in the training cohort (AUC 0.903) and clinically useful performance in the external validation dataset (AUC 0.826), indicating generalizability potential. To enhance clinical utility and interpretability, predicted probabilities were categorized into actionable likelihood ratio (LR) intervals: highly unlikely (LR 0.0), unlikely (LR 0.13), gray zone (LR 0.85), more likely (LR 2.14), and likely (LR 8.19) based on the training cohort. External validation suggested temporal and geographical robustness, though some variability in AUC and LR performance was observed, as anticipated in real-world settings. The parsimonious M3-score, integrating AI-based CT quantification with clinical and laboratory data, offers an interpretable tool for predicting in-hospital COVID-19 mortality, showing robust training performance. Observed performance variations in external validation underscore the need for careful interpretation and further extensive validation across international cohorts to confirm wider applicability and robustness before widespread clinical adoption.

TI  - Artificial intelligence-based clinical decision support for liver transplant evaluation and considerations about fairness: A qualitative study
T2  - HEPATOLOGY COMMUNICATIONS
LA  - English
AB  - Background: The use of large-scale data and artificial intelligence (AI) to support complex transplantation decisions is in its infancy. Transplant candidate decision-making, which relies heavily on subjective assessment (ie, high variability), provides a ripe opportunity for AI-based clinical decision support (CDS). However, AI-CDS for transplant applications must consider important concerns regarding fairness (ie, health equity). The objective of this study was to use human-centered design methods to elicit providers' perceptions of AI-CDS for liver transplant listing decisions.
   Methods: In this multicenter qualitative study conducted from December 2020 to July 2021, we performed semistructured interviews with 53 multi-disciplinary liver transplant providers from 2 transplant centers. We used inductive coding and constant comparison analysis of interview data.
   Results: Analysis yielded 6 themes important for the design of fair AI-CDS for liver transplant listing decisions: (1) transparency in the creators behind the AI-CDS and their motivations; (2) understanding how the AI-CDS uses data to support recommendations (ie, interpretability); (3) acknowledgment that AI-CDS could mitigate emotions and biases; (4) AI-CDS as a member of the transplant team, not a replacement; (5) identifying patient resource needs; and (6) including the patient's role in the AI-CDS.
   Conclusions: Overall, providers interviewed were cautiously optimistic about the potential for AI-CDS to improve clinical and equitable outcomes for patients. These findings can guide multidisciplinary developers in the design and implementation of AI-CDS that deliberately considers health equity.

AB  - South Asian countries are highly vulnerable to anemia- a condition affecting numerous children, women, and adolescents. Early detection and effective treatment of anemia could significantly reduce its prevalence. Therefore, in this study, we leveraged clinical records from a Bangladeshi Hospital to develop an adaptive machine learning framework designed to predict anemia by analyzing patients' hematological parameters. Our research includes comprehensive data exploration and introduces XAI-enhanced Tree-based models, which comprises four traditional machine learning algorithms: Decision Tree Classifier, Gradient Boosting Decision Trees, Random Forest Classifier, and Extra Trees Classifier. We addressed key data analytics challenges using various statistical methods, including outlier management with the Z-score test, feature skewness (and kurtosis) analysis, feature correlation assessment via the Pearson correlation technique, feature importance evaluation with the Random Forest Classifier, and a Z-test to determine the p-value of anemia-related features. Besides, the machine learning models are optimized by applying Grid Search hyperparameter tuning. Our fine-tuned Treedriven models, particularly Random Forest Classifier and Gradient Boosting Decision Trees, demonstrated exceptional predictive performance in all the evaluation metrics. We also performed stratified cross-validation, computed 95 % bootstrap confidence intervals, and conducted permutation-based validation, which yielded a minimal p-value-all to ensure a rigorous evaluation of our models. Furthermore, exploratory data analysis and SHAP explainable plots revealed that 'hemoglobin level' is the most important risk factor with substantial influence on anemia diagnosis and decision-making. We utilized a parallel open-source dataset to validate our model's performance, and the experimental results highlighted our proposed pipelines superiority. Moreover, to support adoption in clinical settings, we developed an intuitive real-time prediction interface that provides a clinical risk score along with SHAP-based model explanations, enabling healthcare professionals to understand the reasoning behind each prediction. To conclude, we believe the introduced framework could serve as an AIdriven decision support system for anemia diagnosis, potentially offering a significant contribution to automating the healthcare industry.

AB  - Epilepsy is a prevalent neurological disorder that poses life-threatening emergencies. Early electroencephalogram (EEG) seizure detection can mitigate the risks and aid in the treatment of patients with epilepsy. EEG based epileptic seizure (ES) detection has significant applications in epilepsy treatment and medical diagnosis. Therefore, this paper presents an innovative framework for efficient ES detection, providing coefficient and distance correlation feature selection algorithms, a Bagged Tree-based classifer (BTBC), and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). Initially, the Butterworth filter is employed to eliminate various artifacts, and the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is used to decompose the EEG signals and extract various eigenvalue features of the statistical time domain (STD) as linear and Fractal dimension-based non-linear (FD-NL). The optimal features are then identified through correlation coefficients with P-value and distance correlation analysis.These features are subsequently utilized by the Bagged Tree-based classifer (BTBC). The proposed model provides best performance in mitigating overfitting issues and improves the average accuracy by 2% using (CD, E), (AB, CD, E), and (A, B) experimental types as compared to other machine learning (ML) models using well-known Bonn and UCI-EEG benchmark datasets. Finally, SHapley additive exPlanation (SHAP) was used to interpret and explain the decision-making process of the proposed model. The results highlight the framework's capability to accurately classify ES, thereby improving the diagnosis process in patients with brain dysfunctions.

AB  - Emergency Departments (EDs) are the most overcrowded places in public hospitals. Machine learning can support decisions on effective ED resource management by accurately forecasting the number of ED visits. In addition, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques can help explain decisions from forecasting models and address challenges like lack of trust in machine learning results. The objective of this paper is to use machine learning and XAI to forecast and explain the ED visits on the next on duty day. Towards this end, a case study is presented that uses the XGBoost algorithm to create a model that forecasts the number of patient visits to the ED of the University Hospital of Ioannina in Greece, based on historical data from patient visits, time-based data, dates of holidays and special events, and weather data. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) framework is used to explain the model. The evaluation of the forecasting model resulted in an MAE value of 18.37, revealing a more accurate model than the baseline, with an MAE of 29.38. The number of patient visits is mostly affected by the day of the week of the on duty day, the mean number of visits in the previous four on duty days, and the maximum daily temperature. The results of this work can help policy makers in healthcare make more accurate and transparent decisions that increase the trust of people affected by them (e.g., medical staff).

AB  - Feature Selection (FS) is essential in the Internet of Things (IoT)-based Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the system. With the increasing number of sensors and devices used in healthcare, the volume of data generated is vast and complex. Relevant FS from this data is crucial in reducing computational overhead, improving the system's interpretability, and enhancing the Decision-Making System (DMS) quality. FS also aids in addressing the problems of data redundancy and noise, which can negatively impact the system's performance. FS is critical to developing practical and dependable CDSS in IoT-based healthcare sectors. This research proposes a two-phase FS model. Phase-I employs an ensemble of five Filter Methods (FM), followed by a Pearson Correlation Method (PCM). Phase-II uses the Binary Optimized Genetic Grey Wolf Optimization Algorithm (BOGGWOA) as a Wrapper Method (WM). This recommended model integrates the most valuable features of each filter. Then, it uses the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) to get rid of features that aren't needed, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to guess how accurate their classification will be, and BOGGWOA as the Wrapper Method (WM) to pick the most essential features with the best CA.

AB  - Objective To develop an electronic medical record (EMR) data processing tool that confers clinical context to machine learning (ML) algorithms for error handling, bias mitigation, and interpretability.Materials and Methods We present Trust-MAPS, an algorithm that translates clinical domain knowledge into high-dimensional, mixed-integer programming models that capture physiological and biological constraints on clinical measurements. EMR data are projected onto this constrained space, effectively bringing outliers to fall within a physiologically feasible range. We then compute the distance of each data point from the constrained space modeling healthy physiology to quantify deviation from the norm. These distances, termed "trust-scores," are integrated into the feature space for downstream ML applications. We demonstrate the utility of Trust-MAPS by training a binary classifier for early sepsis prediction on data from the 2019 PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenge, using the XGBoost algorithm and applying SMOTE for overcoming class-imbalance.Results The Trust-MAPS framework shows desirable behavior in handling potential errors and boosting predictive performance. We achieve an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.89-0.92) for predicting sepsis 6 hours before onset-a marked 15% improvement over a baseline model trained without Trust-MAPS.Discussions Downstream classification performance improves after Trust-MAPS preprocessing, highlighting the bias reducing capabilities of the error-handling projections. Trust-scores emerge as clinically meaningful features that not only boost predictive performance for clinical decision support tasks but also lend interpretability to ML models.Conclusion This work is the first to translate clinical domain knowledge into mathematical constraints, model cross-vital dependencies, and identify aberrations in high-dimensional medical data. Our method allows for error handling in EMR and confers interpretability and superior predictive power to models trained for clinical decision support.

AB  - Although machine learning (ML) models are widely used in many fields, their prediction processes are often hard to understand. This lack of transparency makes it harder for people to trust them, especially in high-stakes fields like healthcare and finance. Human-interpretable explanations for model predictions are crucial in these contexts. While existing local interpretation methods have been proposed, many suffer from low local fidelity, instability, and limited effectiveness when applied to highly nonlinear models. This paper presents SVM-X, a model-agnostic local explanation approach designed to address these challenges. By leveraging the inherent symmetry of the SVM hyperplane, SVM-X precisely captures the local decision boundaries of complex nonlinear models, providing more accurate and stable explanations. Experimental evaluations on the UCI Adult dataset, the Bank Marketing dataset, and the Amazon Product Review dataset demonstrate that SVM-X consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods like LIME and LEMNA. Notably, SVM-X achieves up to a 27.2% improvement in accuracy. Our work introduces a reliable and interpretable framework for understanding machine learning predictions, offering a promising new direction for future research.

AB  - The relationship between ethics and artificial intelligence in medicine is a crucial and complex topic that falls within its broader context. Ethics in medical artificial intelligence involves ensuring that technologies are safe, fair, and respect patient privacy. This includes concerns about the accuracy of diagnoses provided by artificial intelligence, fairness in patient treatment, and protection of personal health data. Advances in artificial intelligence can significantly improve healthcare, from more accurate diagnoses to personalized treatments. However, it is essential that developments in medical artificial intelligence are carried out with strong ethical consideration, involving healthcare professionals, artificial intelligence experts, patients, and ethics specialists to guide and oversee their implementation. Finally, transparency in artificial intelligence algorithms and ongoing training for medical professionals are fundamental.

AB  - Explainable and interpretable machine learning has emerged as essential in leveraging artificial intelligence within high-stakes domains such as healthcare to ensure transparency and trustworthiness. Feature importance analysis plays a crucial role in improving model interpretability by pinpointing the most relevant input features, particularly in disease subtyping applications, aimed at stratifying patients based on a small set of signature genes and biomarkers. While clustering methods, including unsupervised random forests, have demonstrated good performance, approaches for evaluating feature contributions in an unsupervised regime are notably scarce. To address this gap, we introduce a novel methodology to enhance the interpretability of unsupervised random forests by elucidating feature contributions through the construction of feature graphs, both over the entire dataset and individual clusters, that leverage parent-child node splits within the trees. Feature selection strategies to derive effective feature combinations from these graphs are presented and extensively evaluated on synthetic and benchmark datasets against state-of-the-art methods, standing out for performance, computational efficiency, reliability, versatility and ability to provide cluster-specific insights. In a disease subtyping application, clustering kidney cancer gene expression data over a feature subset selected with our approach reveals three patient groups with different survival outcomes. Cluster-specific analysis identifies distinctive feature contributions and interactions, essential for devising targeted interventions, conducting personalised risk assessments, and enhancing our understanding of the underlying molecular complexities.

AB  - Background and Objective: Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) have substantially evolved, aiding healthcare professionals in informed patient care decision-making. The integration of AI, encompassing machine learning and natural language processing, has notably enhanced the capabilities of CDSS. However, a significant challenge remains in addressing data imbalance and the black box nature of AI algorithms, particularly for rare diseases or underrepresented demographic groups. This study aims to propose a model, U-AnoGAN, designed to overcome these hurdles and augment the diagnostic accuracy of AI-integrated CDSS. Methods: The U-AnoGAN was trained using masks derived from normal data, focusing on the Covid-19 and pneumonia datasets. Anomaly scores were calculated to assess the model's performance compared to existing AnoGAN-related algorithms. The study also evaluated the model's interpretability through the visualization of abnormal regions. Results: The results indicated that U-AnoGAN surpassed its counterparts in performance and interpretability. It effectively addressed the data imbalance problem by necessitating only normal data and showcased enhanced diagnostic accuracy. Precision, sensitivity, and specificity values reflected U-AnoGAN's superior capability in accurate disease prediction, diagnosis, treatment recommendations, and adverse event detection. Conclusions: U-AnoGAN significantly bolsters the predictive power of AI-integrated CDSS, enabling more precise and timely diagnoses while providing better visualization to potentially overcome the black box problem. This model presents tremendous potential in elevating patient care with advanced AI tools and fostering more accurate and effective decision-making in healthcare environments. As the healthcare sector grapples with escalating data complexity and volume, the importance of models like U-AnoGAN in enhancing CDSS cannot be overstated.

AB  - Debilitating hearing toss (HL) affects similar to 6% of the human population. Only 20% of the people in need of a hearing assistive device will eventually seek and acquire one. The number of people that are satisfied with their Hearing Aids (HAids) and continue using them in the tong term is even tower. Understanding the personal, behavioral, environmental, or other factors that correlate with the optimal HAid fitting and with users' experience of HAids is a significant step in improving patient satisfaction and quality of life, while reducing societal and financial burden. In SMART BEAR we are addressing this need by making use of the capacity of modern HAids to provide dynamic logging of their operation and by combining this information with a big amount of information about the medical, environmental, and social context of each HAid user. We are studying hearing rehabilitation through a 12-month continuous monitoring of HL patients, collecting data, such as participants' demographics, audiometric and medical data, their cognitive and mental status, their habits, and preferences, through a set of medical devices and wearables, as well as through face-to-face and remote clinical assessments and fitting/fine-tuning sessions. Descriptive, AI-based analysis and assessment of the relationships between heterogeneous data and HL-related parameters will help clinical researchers to better understand the overall health profiles of HL patients, and to identify patterns or relations that may be proven essential for future clinical trials. In addition, the future state and behavioral (e.g., HAids Satisfiability and HAids usage) of the patients will be predicted with time-dependent machine learning models to assist the clinical researchers to decide on the nature of the interventions. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques will be leveraged to better understand the factors that play a significant role in the success of a hearing rehabilitation program, constructing patient profiles. This paper is a conceptual one aiming to describe the upcoming data collection process and proposed framework for providing a comprehensive profile for patients with HL in the context of EU-funded SMART BEAR project. Such patient profiles can be invaluable in HL treatment as they can help to identify the characteristics making patients more prone to drop out and stop using their HAids, using their HAids sufficiently tong during the day, and being more satisfied by their HAids experience. They can also help decrease the number of needed remote sessions with their Audiologist for counseling, and/or HAids fine tuning, or the number of manual changes of HAids program (as indication of poor sound quality and bad adaptation of HAids configuration to patients' real needs and daily challenges), leading to reduced healthcare cost.

AB  - The recent release of large-scale healthcare datasets has greatly propelled the research of data-driven deep learning models for healthcare applications. However, due to the nature of such deep black-boxed models, concerns about interpretability, fairness, and biases in healthcare scenarios where human lives are at stake call for a careful and thorough examination of both datasets and models. In this work, we focus on MIMIC-IV (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care, version IV), the largest publicly available healthcare dataset, and conduct comprehensive analyses of interpretability as well as dataset representation bias and prediction fairness of deep learning models for in-hospital mortality prediction. First, we analyze the interpretability of deep learning mortality prediction models and observe that (1) the best-performing interpretability method successfully identifies critical features for mortality prediction on various prediction models as well as recognizing new important features that domain knowledge does not consider; (2) prediction models rely on demographic features, raising concerns in fairness. Therefore, we then evaluate the fairness of models and do observe the unfairness: (1) there exists disparate treatment in prescribing mechanical ventilation among patient groups across ethnicity, gender and age; (2) models often rely on racial attributes unequally across subgroups to generate their predictions. We further draw concrete connections between interpretability methods and fairness metrics by showing how feature importance from interpretability methods can be beneficial in quantifying potential disparities in mortality predictors. Our analysis demonstrates that the prediction performance is not the only factor to consider when evaluating models for healthcare applications, since high prediction performance might be the result of unfair utilization of demographic features. Our findings suggest that future research in AI models for healthcare applications can benefit from utilizing the analysis workflow of interpretability and fairness as well as verifying if models achieve superior performance at the cost of introducing bias.

AB  - Survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is contingent on time-sensitive interventions taken by onlookers, emergency call operators, first responders, emergency medical services (EMS) personnel, and hospital healthcare staff. By building integrated cardiac resuscitation systems of care, measurement systems, and techniques for assuring the correct execution of evidence-based treatments by bystanders, EMS professionals, and hospital employees, survival results can be improved. To aid in OHCA prognosis and treatment, we develop a hybrid agnostic explanation TabNet (HAE-TabNet) model to predict OHCA patient survival. According to the results, the HAE-TabNet model has an "Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value" (ROC AUC) score of 0.9934 (95% confidence interval 0.9933-0.9935), which outperformed other machine learning models in the previous study, such as XGBoost, k-nearest neighbors, random forest, decision trees, and logistic regression. In order to achieve model prediction explainability for a non-expert in the artificial intelligence field, we combined the HAE-TabNet model with a LIME-based explainable model. This HAE-TabNet model may assist medical professionals in the prognosis and treatment of OHCA patients effectively.

AB  - Background Public health policy evaluation is crucial for improving health outcomes, optimizing healthcare resource allocation, and ensuring fairness and transparency in decision-making. With the rise of big data, traditional evaluation methods face new challenges, requiring innovative approaches.Methods This article reviews the principles, scope, and limitations of traditional public health policy evaluation methods and explores the application of machine learning in evaluating public health policies. It analyzes the specific steps for applying machine learning and provides practical examples. The challenges discussed include model interpretability, data bias, the continuation of historical health inequities, and data privacy concerns, while proposing ways to better apply machine learning in the context of big data.Results Machine learning techniques hold promise in overcoming some limitations of traditional methods, offering more precise evaluations of public health policies. However, challenges such as lack of model interpretability, the perpetuation of health inequities, data bias, and privacy concerns remain significant.Discussion To address these challenges, the article suggests integrating data-driven and theory-driven approaches to improve model interpretability, developing multi-level data strategies to reduce bias and mitigate health inequities, ensuring data privacy through technical safeguards and legal frameworks, and employing validation and benchmarking strategies to enhance model robustness and reproducibility.

AB  - Detecting skin melanoma in the early stage using dermoscopic images presents a complex challenge due to the inherent variability in images. Utilizing dermatology datasets, the study aimed to develop Automated Diagnostic Systems for early skin cancer detection. Existing methods often struggle with diverse skin types, cancer stages, and imaging conditions, highlighting a critical gap in reliability and explainability. The novel approach proposed through this research addresses this gap by utilizing a proposed model with advanced layers, including Global Average Pooling, Batch Normalization, Dropout, and dense layers with ReLU and Swish activations to improve model performance. The proposed model achieved accuracies of 95.23% and 96.48% for the two different datasets, demonstrating its robustness, reliability, and strong performance across other performance metrics. Explainable AI techniques such as Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping and Saliency Maps offered insights into the model's decision- making process. These advancements enhance skin cancer diagnostics, provide medical experts with resources for early detection, improve clinical outcomes, and increase acceptance of Deep Learning-based diagnostics in healthcare.

AB  - Background Balancing artificial intelligence (AI) support with appropriate human oversight is challenging, with associated risks such as algorithm aversion and technology dominance . Research areas like eXplainable AI (XAI) and Frictional AI aim to address these challenges. Studies have shown that presenting XAI explanations as "juxtaposed evidence" supporting contrasting classifications, rather than just providing predictions, can be beneficial. Objectives This study aimed to design and compare multiple pipelines for generating juxtaposed evidence in the form of class activation maps (CAMs) that highlight areas of interest in a fracture detection task with X-ray images. Materials and Methods We designed three pipelines to generate such evidence. The pipelines are based on a fracture detection task from 630 thoraco-lumbar X-ray images (48% of which contained fractures). The first, a single-model approach, uses an algorithm of the Grad-CAM family applied to a ResNeXt-50 network trained through transfer learning. The second, a dual-model approach, employs two networks-one optimized for sensitivity and the other for specificity-providing targeted explanations for positive and negative cases. The third, a generative approach, leverages autoencoders to create activation maps from feature tensors, extracted from the raw images. Each approach produced two versions of activation maps: AM3-as we termed it-which captures fine-grained, low-level features, and AM4, highlighting high-level, aggregated features. We conducted a validation study by comparing the generated maps with binary ground-truth masks derived from a consensus of four clinician annotators, identifying the actual locations of fractures in a subset of positive cases. Results HiResCAM proved to be the best performing Grad-CAM variant and was used in both the single- and dual-model strategies. The generative approach demonstrated the greatest overlap with the clinicians' assessments, indicating its ability to align with human expertise. Conclusion The results highlight the potential of Judicial AI to enhance diagnostic decision-making and foster a synergistic collaboration between humans and AI.

AB  - Infertility is a common problem across the world. Infertility distribution due to male factors ranges from 40% to 50%. Existing artificial intelligence (AI) systems are not often human interpretable. Further, clinicians are unaware of how data analytical tools make decisions, and as a result, they have limited exposure to healthcare. Using explainable AI tools makes AI systems transparent and traceable, enhancing users' trust and confidence in decision-making. The main contribution of this study is to introduce an explainable model for investigating male fertility prediction. Nine features related to lifestyle and environmental factors are utilized to develop a male fertility prediction model. Five AI tools, namely support vector machine, adaptive boosting, conventional extreme gradient boost (XGB), random forest, and extra tree algorithms are deployed with a balanced and imbalanced dataset. To produce our model in a trustworthy way, an explainable AI is applied. The techniques are (1) local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) and (2) Shapley additive explanations (SHAP). Additionally, ELI5 is utilized to inspect the feature's importance. Finally, XGB outperformed and obtained an AUC of 0.98, which is optimal compared to existing AI systems.

AB  - Recently, Telehealth connects patients to vital healthcare services via remote monitoring, wireless communications, videoconferencing, and electronic consults. By increasing access to specialists and physicians, telehealth assists in ensuring patients receive the proper care at the right time and right place. Teleophthalmology is a study of telemedicine that provides services for eye care using digital medical equipment and telecommunication technologies. Multimedia computing with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) for telehealth has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our society, but several technical challenges should be resolved before this potential can be realized. Advances in artificial intelligence methods and tools reduce waste and wait times, provide service efficiency and better insights, and increase speed, the level of accuracy, and productivity in medicine and telehealth. Therefore, this study develops an XAI-enabled teleophthalmology for diabetic retinopathy grading and classification (XAITO-DRGC) model. The proposed XAITO-DRGC model utilizes OphthoAI IoMT headsets to enable remote monitoring of diabetic retinopathy (DR) disease. To accomplish this, the XAITO-DRGC model applies median filtering (MF) and contrast enhancement as a pre-processing step. In addition, the XAITO-DRGC model applies U-Net-based image segmentation and SqueezeNet-based feature extractor. Moreover, Archimedes optimization algorithm (AOA) with a bidirectional gated recurrent convolutional unit (BGRCU) is exploited for DR detection and classification.

AB  - Objective: Early diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases is a crucial task in medical practice. With the application of computer audition in the healthcare field, artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied to clinical non-invasive intelligent auscultation of heart sounds to provide rapid and effective pre-screening. However, AI models generally require large amounts of data which may cause privacy issues. Unfortunately, it is difficult to collect large amounts of healthcare data from a single centre. Methods: In this study, we propose federated learning (FL) optimisation strategies for the practical application in multi-centre institutional heart sound databases. The horizontal FL is mainly employed to tackle the privacy problem by aligning the feature spaces of FL participating institutions without information leakage. In addition, techniques based on deep learning have poor interpretability due to their "black-box" property, which limits the feasibility of AI in real medical data. To this end, vertical FL is utilised to address the issues of model interpretability and data scarcity. Conclusion: Experimental results demonstrate that, the proposed FL framework can achieve good performance for heart sound abnormality detection by taking the personal privacy protection into account. Moreover, using the federated feature space is beneficial to balance the interpretability of the vertical FL and the privacy of the data. Significance: This work realises the potential of FL from research to clinical practice, and is expected to have extensive application in the federated smart medical system.

AB  - How to present an intelligent model based on known diagnostic knowledge to assist medical diagnosis and display the reasoning process is an interesting issue worth exploring. This study developed a novel intelligent model for visualized inference of medical diagnosis with a case of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Four classes of TCM's diagnosis composed of Yin deficiency, Liver Yin deficiency, Kidney Yin deficiency, and LiverKidney Yin deficiency were selected as research examples. According to the knowledge of diagnostic points in "Diagnostics of TCM", a total of 2000 samples for training and testing were randomly generated for the four classes of TCM's diagnosis. In addition, a total of 60 clinical samples were collected from hospital clinical cases. Training samples were sent to the pre-training language model of Chinese Bert for training to generate intelligent diagnostic module. Simultaneously, a mathematical algorithm was developed to generate inferential digraphs. In order to evaluate the performance of the model, the values of accuracy, F1 score, Mse, Loss and other indicators were calculated for model training and testing. And the confusion matrices and ROC curves were plotted to estimate the predictive ability of the model. The novel model was also compared with RF and XGBOOST. And some instances of inferential digraphs with the model were displayed and analyzed. It may be a new attempt to solve the problem of interpretable and inferential intelligent models in the field of artificial intelligence on medical diagnosis of TCM.

AB  - The efficient patient-independent and interpretable framework for electroencephalogram (EEG) epileptic seizure detection (ESD) has informative challenges due to the complex pattern of EEG nature. Automated detection of ES is crucial, while Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is urgently needed to justify the model detection of epileptic seizures in clinical applications. Therefore, this study implements an XAI-based computer-aided ES detection system (XAI-CAESDs), comprising three major modules, including of feature engineering module, a seizure detection module, and an explainable decision-making process module in a smart healthcare system. To ensure the privacy and security of biomedical EEG data, the blockchain is employed. Initially, the Butterworth filter eliminates various artifacts, and the Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform (DTCWT) decomposes EEG signals, extracting real and imaginary eigenvalue features using frequency domain (FD), time domain (TD) linear feature, and Fractal Dimension (FD) of non-linear features. The best features are selected by using Correlation Coefficients (CC) and Distance Correlation (DC). The selected features are fed into the Stacking Ensemble Classifiers (SEC) for EEG ES detection. Further, the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) method of XAI is implemented to facilitate the interpretation of predictions made by the proposed approach, enabling medical experts to make accurate and understandable decisions. The proposed Stacking Ensemble Classifiers (SEC) in XAI-CAESDs have demonstrated 2% best average accuracy, recall, specificity, and F1-score using the University of California, Irvine, Bonn University, and Boston Children's Hospital-MIT EEG data sets. The proposed framework enhances decision-making and the diagnosis process using biomedical EEG signals and ensures data security in smart healthcare systems.

AB  - Despite their great promise, artificial intelligence (AI) systems have yet to become ubiquitous in the daily practice of medicine largely due to several crucial unmet needs of healthcare practitioners. These include lack of explanations in clinically meaningful terms, handling the presence of unknown medical conditions, and transparency regarding the system's limitations, both in terms of statistical performance as well as recognizing situations for which the system's predictions are irrelevant. We articulate these unmet clinical needs as machine-learning (ML) problems and systematically address them with cutting-edge ML techniques. We focus on electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis as an example domain in which AI has great potential and tackle two challenging tasks: the detection of a heterogeneous mix of known and unknown arrhythmias from ECG and the identification of underlying cardio-pathology from segments annotated as normal sinus rhythm recorded in patients with an intermittent arrhythmia. We validate our methods by simulating a screening for arrhythmias in a large-scale population while adhering to statistical significance requirements. Specifically, our system 1) visualizes the relative importance of each part of an ECG segment for the final model decision; 2) upholds specified statistical constraints on its out-of-sample performance and provides uncertainty estimation for its predictions; 3) handles inputs containing unknown rhythm types; and 4) handles data from unseen patients while also flagging cases in which the model's outputs are not usable for a specific patient. This work represents a significant step toward overcoming the limitations currently impeding the integration of AI into clinical practice in cardiology and medicine in general.

AB  - Background and aims: Real-world studies on vedolizumab in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are often limited by small sample size and short follow-up. In this study, we investigated the 2-year effectiveness and safety of vedolizumab in patients with IBD, and applied eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to identify predictors of both. Methods: The Long-term Italian Vedolizumab Effectiveness (LIVE) study is multicentric, ambispective, observational study enrolling 1111 IBD patients (563 Crohn's disease, CD, 542 ulcerative colitis, UC). Steroid-free clinical remission (SFCR) at 24 months was the primary endpoint. A XAI model (eXtreme Gradient Boosting, XGB) was applied to identify the main clinical predictors of SFCR and development of adverse events (AEs). Results: Rates of SFCR at 24 months were 31.6 % and 39.7 % in CD and UC patients, and 0.14 AEs per patient-year was recorded. On XGB analysis, previous exposure to anti-TNF alpha and older age were the most important drivers for the prediction of SFCR; lower baseline CRP levels and fewer comorbidities were the most important features associated with no development of AEs. Conclusions: Vedolizumab is effective and safe in IBD patients. XAI yielded promising results in identifying the most important predictors of SFCR and development of AEs.

When shared data is later used in the development of artificial intelligence (AI) systems or machine learning (ML) models, the trust lineage extends to the users of the system, typically practitioners in fields such as healthcare and finance. Practitioners rely on AI developers to have used relevant, trustworthy data, but may have limited insight and recourse. This article introduces a software architecture and implementation of a system based on design patterns from the field of self-sovereign identity. Scientists can issue signed credentials attesting to qualities of their data resources. Data contributions to ML models are recorded in a bill of materials (BOM), which is stored with the model as a verifiable credential. The BOM provides a traceable record of the supply chain for an AI system, which facilitates on-going scrutiny of the qualities of the contributing components. The verified BOM, and its linkage to certified data qualities, is used in the AI scrutineer, a web-based tool designed to offer practitioners insight into ML model constituents and highlight any problems with adopted datasets, should they be found to have biased data or be otherwise discredited.

AB  - In the past several years, the world has witnessed an acute surge in the production and usage of smart devices which are referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT). These devices interact with each other as well as with their surrounding environments to sense, gather and process data of various kinds. Such devices are now part of our everyday's life and are being actively used in several verticals, such as transportation, healthcare, and smart homes. IoT devices, which usually are resource-constrained, often need to communicate with other devices, such as fog nodes and/or cloud computing servers to accomplish certain tasks that demand large resource requirements. These communications entail unprecedented security vulnerabilities, where malicious parties find in this heterogeneous and multiparty architecture a compelling platform to launch their attacks. In this work, we conduct an in-depth survey on the existing intrusion detection solutions proposed for the IoT ecosystem which includes the IoT devices as well as the communications between the IoT, fog computing, and cloud computing layers. Although some survey articles already exist, the originality of this work stems from the three following points: 1) discuss the security issues of the IoT ecosystem not only from the perspective of IoT devices but also taking into account the communications between the IoT, fog, and cloud computing layers; 2) propose a novel two-level classification scheme that first categorizes the literature based on the approach used to detect attacks and then classify each approach into a set of subtechniques; and 3) propose a comprehensive cybersecurity framework that combines the concepts of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), federated learning, game theory, and social psychology to offer future IoT systems a strong protection against cyberattacks.

AB  - The field of digital histopathology has seen incredible growth in recent years. Digital pathology is becoming a relevant tool in healthcare, industrial and research sectors to reduce the saturation of pathology departments and improve the productivity of pathologists by increasing diagnostic accuracy and reducing turnaround times. Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms may be used for the identification of relevant regions, extraction of features from a histological image and overall classification of images into specific classes. The combination of digital histopathology imaging and AI therefore presents a significant opportunity for the support of the pathologists' tasks and opens up a whole new world of computational analysis. In this paper, we have analysed the present, the challenges and the future of the computational pathology discussing the different existing strategies to overcome its main limitations and ensure the computational pathology acceptance. The lack of labelled data, which is the possibly largest challenge for all medical AI applications, is even more pronounced in computational pathology because of the multi-gigapixel nature of the images and high data heterogeneity. We consider the future of the computational pathology is the combination of weak label strategies with active learning and crowdsourcing scenarios since it would remove some of the workload from clinical experts and manual annotation obtaining clinically satisfactory performance with minimal annotation effort. In addition, we believe areas such as explainable AI, data fusion and secure role-based data sharing will be receiving increasing research attention in computational pathology in the close future.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major global health concern, demanding accurate predictive models to aid preventive healthcare strategies. Heart failure, stroke, and coronary artery disease are among the disorders that fall under the umbrella term of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Leveraging the Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) algorithm in conjunction with deep belief networks (DBNs) aims to improve CVD risk prediction accuracy. Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) draws inspiration from the cooperative behavior of Harris's hawks in nature, providing an efficient metaheuristic search algorithm for optimization problems. Integrating HHO into machine learning frameworks enhances the exploration and exploitation of search spaces, leading to improved model performance and convergence rates, particularly in deep learning tasks like feature selection and hyperparameter tuning. Powerful generative models called deep belief networks (DBNs) are made up of several layers of latent, stochastic variables. Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) serve as building blocks in the training process of deep belief networks (DBNs), facilitating the unsupervised pre-training of hidden layers. Leveraging RBMs within DBNs enables the extraction of hierarchical representations, enhancing the network's ability to learn intricate patterns and improve predictive performance in complex data settings. They leverage unsupervised learning techniques to extract intricate patterns and hierarchical representations from complex data, making them ideal for tasks such as feature learning and classification in machine learning research. This study introduces innovative algorithms, including the correlation-based weighted compound feature generation (CWCFG) technique, to enhance the optimization process of HHO. Comparative analysis against traditional machine learning models and rule-based firefly optimizer (RBFO) and Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) with the state-of-the-art deep learning techniques demonstrates the efficacy of the CWCFG-HHO-DBN model. Additionally, an in-depth feature importance analysis identifies key predictors, enriching the model's interpretability. The research conducts a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed model, employing various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure. With a remarkable accuracy of 97.19%, the HHO-DBN model shows promise in enhancing CVD risk prediction. The findings underscore its potential in personalized medicine, facilitating tailored interventions for high-risk individuals. Future directions include refining the algorithm and expanding its application in healthcare settings.

AB  - The accuracy-transparency trade-off is one of the most notable challenges when applying machine learning tools in the medical domain. NEFCLASS is a popular NEURO-FUZZY classifier in medical diagnosis systems. NEFCLASS performs increasingly poorly as the data skewness increases. This paper presents a combined approach to improve the classification accuracy and interpretability of the NEFCLASS classifier, when feature values of the training and testing datasets exhibit positive skewness. The proposed model consists of two steps. Firstly, a modified NEFCLASS classifier embedded with a choice of two alternative discretization methods, MME and CAIM is implemented. Secondly, we devised a new rule pruning method based on the Habermans' adjusted residual to reduce the size of the resulting ruleset. This rule-pruning method improves the interpretability of NEFCLASS without significant accuracy deterioration. Moreover, a hybrid approach combining the two approaches provides a considerable improvement in classification accuracy and transparency of NEFCLASS on skewed data. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Clinical applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare, including in the field of oncology, have the potential to advance diagnosis and treatment. The literature suggests that patient values should be considered in decision making when using AI in clinical care; however, there is a lack of practical guidance for clinicians on how to approach these conversations and incorporate patient values into clinical decision making. We provide a practical, values-based guide for clinicians to assist in critical reflection and the incorporation of patient values into shared decision making when deciding to use AI in clinical care. Values that are relevant to patients, identified in the literature, include trust, privacy and confidentiality, non-maleficence, safety, accountability, beneficence, autonomy, transparency, compassion, equity, justice, and fairness. The guide offers questions for clinicians to consider when adopting the potential use of AI in their practice; explores illness understanding between the patient and clinician; encourages open dialogue of patient values; reviews all clinically appropriate options; and makes a shared decision of what option best meets the patient's values. The guide can be used for diverse clinical applications of AI.

AB  - Purpose of reviewThis review aims to summarize and discuss the ethical considerations regarding large language model (LLM) use in the field of ophthalmology.Recent findingsThis review of 47 articles on LLM applications in ophthalmology highlights their diverse potential uses, including education, research, clinical decision support, and surgical assistance (as an aid in operative notes). We also review ethical considerations such as the inability of LLMs to interpret data accurately, the risk of promoting controversial or harmful recommendations, and breaches of data privacy. These concerns imply the need for cautious integration of artificial intelligence in healthcare, emphasizing human oversight, transparency, and accountability to mitigate risks and uphold ethical standards.SummaryThe integration of LLMs in ophthalmology offers potential advantages such as aiding in clinical decision support and facilitating medical education through their ability to process queries and analyze ophthalmic imaging and clinical cases. However, their utilization also raises ethical concerns regarding data privacy, potential misinformation, and biases inherent in the datasets used. Awareness of these concerns should be addressed in order to optimize its utility in the healthcare setting. More importantly, promoting responsible and careful use by consumers should be practiced.

AB  - BackgroundThere is an increasing interest in clinical prediction tools that can achieve high prediction accuracy and provide explanations of the factors leading to increased risk of adverse outcomes. However, approaches to explaining complex machine learning (ML) models are rarely informed by end-user needs and user evaluations of model interpretability are lacking in the healthcare domain. We used extended revisions of previously-published theoretical frameworks to propose a framework for the design of user-centered displays of explanations. This new framework served as the basis for qualitative inquiries and design review sessions with critical care nurses and physicians that informed the design of a user-centered explanation display for an ML-based prediction tool.MethodsWe used our framework to propose explanation displays for predictions from a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) in-hospital mortality risk model. Proposed displays were based on a model-agnostic, instance-level explanation approach based on feature influence, as determined by Shapley values. Focus group sessions solicited critical care provider feedback on the proposed displays, which were then revised accordingly.ResultsThe proposed displays were perceived as useful tools in assessing model predictions. However, specific explanation goals and information needs varied by clinical role and level of predictive modeling knowledge. Providers preferred explanation displays that required less information processing effort and could support the information needs of a variety of users. Providing supporting information to assist in interpretation was seen as critical for fostering provider understanding and acceptance of the predictions and explanations. The user-centered explanation display for the PICU in-hospital mortality risk model incorporated elements from the initial displays along with enhancements suggested by providers.ConclusionsWe proposed a framework for the design of user-centered displays of explanations for ML models. We used the proposed framework to motivate the design of a user-centered display of an explanation for predictions from a PICU in-hospital mortality risk model. Positive feedback from focus group participants provides preliminary support for the use of model-agnostic, instance-level explanations of feature influence as an approach to understand ML model predictions in healthcare and advances the discussion on how to effectively communicate ML model information to healthcare providers.

AB  - Objectives: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition which is responsible for a high proportion of intrahospital deaths and related healthcare costs each year. Early detection and treatment of sepsis episodes is critical, since an early treatment may highly improve prognosis. This study proposed an original method to increase the interpretability of a set of machine learning models for the early detection of sepsis onset.
   Material and methods: Open data from the electronic medical records of 40,336 patients monitored in intensive care units (ICU), provided by the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2019 is used in this paper. We proposed a method including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model construction and tuning, as well as an original interpretability analysis method for the final stage.
   Results: A total of 24 models were developed and analyzed. The best model, based on 142 features achieved a 0.4274 utility score. The best compact model integrates only 20 selected features, and provided a utility score of 0.3862. Meanwhile, the proposed sensitivity analysis method allows for the identification of the most relevant markers to early detect the onset of sepsis, as well as their interdependence and relative importance on the final decision.
   Conclusion: A set of optimized machine-learning models were proposed for predicting sepsis early in a real-time way with high performance, and interpretable information including the most significant biomarkers were analyzed through novel interpretability method.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is understandably garnering an increased share of voice in the general and specialized media. The recent release of several generative AI products has added "touchable"context to fears of the potential negative effects of AI-rampant job loss, "out-of-control"AI, and deep fake videos, to name a few. A productive conversation about AI requires the conversation to recognize AI as a very broad and diverse field with "narrow"and "general"applications. Narrow AI applications are quite common and widely deployed today. A fearless conversation can be had regarding how narrow AI can be more widely adopted while allowing for increased transparency and comfort. General AI is more complex and generally leads to what level of government regulation may be necessary (if practically possible). This essay focuses on the application of narrow AI in healthcare and fertility. Pros, cons, challenges, and recommendations are presented for a general audience seeking to understand the application of narrow AI. Successful and unsuccessful examples are provided with frameworks for approaching the narrow AI opportunity. (Fertil Sterile 2023;120:3-7. & COPY;2023 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.)

AB  - This work presents a computer-aided framework for allergy diagnosis which is capable of handling comorbidities. The system was developed using datasets collected from allergy testing centers in South India. Intradermal skin test results of 878 patients were recorded and it was observed that the data contained very few samples for comorbid conditions. Modified data sampling techniques were applied to handle this data imbalance for improving the efficiency of the learning algorithms. The algorithms were cross-validated to choose the optimal trained model for multi-label classification. The transparency of the machine learning models was ensured using post-hoc explainable artificial intelligence approaches. The system was tested by verifying the performance of a trained random forest model on the test data. The training and validation accuracy rate of the decision tree, support vector machine and random forest are 81.62, 81.04 and 83.07 respectively. During evaluation, random forest achieved a rate of 86.39 accuracy overall, and 75% sensitivity for the comorbid Rhinitis-Urticaria class. The framework along with all the functionalities were deployed on mobile devices. The average performance of the clinicians before and after using the decision support system were 77.21% and 81.80% respectively. The diagnosis system integrated with mobile applications serves as a source of information whereby junior clinicians can use it to confirm their diagnostic predictions.

AB  - In recent years, Internet of Things (IoT)-based technologies have advanced healthcare by facilitating the development of monitoring systems, subsequently generating an exponential amount of streaming data. This streaming data can be preprocessed and analyzed using technologies that integrate ensemble models, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), feature selection (FS) method and big data streaming processing platforms to develop predictive real-time systems. This integration adds new value to healthcare that helps organizations enhance clinical decision-making, improve patient care, and elevate the overall quality of healthcare. This article presents a real-time system for the early detection and treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) using a real-world simulation application. The real-time system is developed in two phases. The first phase aims to propose a stacking model, apply a genetic algorithm (GA) and Particle swarm optimization (PSO) as feature selection, and explore a stacking model with the best features with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). The best model with the best-optimized features is used to develop the second phase. The results showed that stacking model with GA is achieved the hightest performance with 100 accuracy, 100 precision, 100 recall, and 100 F1-score. The second phase is designed based on Confluent Cloud, which offers several benefits for creating a real-time streaming system based on Apache Kafka, providing multiple APIs-the Producer API and Consumer API-for data producers and consumers, respectively. Python scripts are developed to pipeline streaming data. The first Python script to generate streaming health attributes that are pushed into a Kafka topic. A second Python script to consume health attributes from a Kafka topic and apply a stacking model to predict CKD in real-time. The results showed that the stacking model with features selected by GA recorded the best performance with 100 accuracy. The pipeline's streaming steps have validated our approach's effectiveness in real-time, leveraging Confluent Cloud and Apache Kafka.

AB  - Trustworthiness is crucial for artificial intelligence (AI) models in clinical settings, and a fundamental aspect of trustworthy AI is uncertainty quantification (UQ). Conformal prediction as a robust uncertainty quantification (UQ) framework has been receiving increasing attention as a valuable tool in improving model trustworthiness. An area of active research is the method of non-conformity score calculation for conformal prediction. We propose deep conformal supervision (DCS), which leverages the intermediate outputs of deep supervision for non-conformity score calculation, via weighted averaging based on the inverse of mean calibration error for each stage. We benchmarked our method on two publicly available datasets focused on medical image classification: a pneumonia chest radiography dataset and a preprocessed version of the 2019 RSNA Intracranial Hemorrhage dataset. Our method achieved mean coverage errors of 16e-4 (CI: 1e-4, 41e-4) and 5e-4 (CI: 1e-4, 10e-4) compared to baseline mean coverage errors of 28e-4 (CI: 2e-4, 64e-4) and 21e-4 (CI: 8e-4, 3e-4) on the two datasets, respectively (p < 0.001 on both datasets). Based on our findings, the baseline results of conformal prediction already exhibit small coverage errors. However, our method shows a significant improvement on coverage error, particularly noticeable in scenarios involving smaller datasets or when considering smaller acceptable error levels, which are crucial in developing UQ frameworks for healthcare AI applications.

AB  - Prognosis of the long-term functional outcome of traumatic brain injury is essential for personalized management of that injury. Nonetheless, accurate prediction remains unavailable. Although machine learning has shown promise in many fields, including medical diagnosis and prognosis, such models are rarely deployed in real-world settings due to a lack of transparency and trustworthiness. To address these drawbacks, we propose a machine learning-based framework that is explainable and aligns with clinical domain knowledge. To build such a framework, additional layers of statistical inference and human expert validation are added to the model, which ensures the predicted risk score's trustworthiness. Using 831 patients with moderate or severe traumatic brain injury to build a model using the proposed framework, an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and accuracy of 0.8085 and 0.7488 were achieved, respectively, in determining which patients will experience poor functional outcomes. The performance of the machine learning classifier is not adversely affected by the imposition of statistical and domain knowledge "checks and balances". Finally, through a case study, we demonstrate how the decision made by a model might be biased if it is not audited carefully.

AB  - Cerebrovascular disease (CVD) is the second leading cause of dementia worldwide. The accurate detection of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) in CVD patients remains an unresolved challenge. We collected the clinical non-imaging data and neuroimaging data from 307 subjects with CVD. Using these data, we developed a multimodal deep learning framework that combined the vision transformer and extreme gradient boosting algorithms. The final hybrid model within the framework included only two neuroimaging features and six clinical features, demonstrating robust performance across both internal and external datasets. Furthermore, the diagnostic performance of our model on a specific dataset was demonstrated to be comparable to that of expert clinicians. Notably, our model can identify the brain regions and clinical features that significantly contribute to the VCI diagnosis, thereby enhancing transparency and interpretability. We developed an accurate and explainable clinical decision support tool to identify the presence of VCI in patients with CVD.

AB  - This study presents DSClustering, a novel algorithm that merges clustering validity with interpretability using the Dempster-Shafer theory. Traditional clustering methods like Kmeans, DBSCAN, and agglomerative clustering, while widely used for their efficiency and accuracy, often fall short in transparency, creating barriers in critical fields such as healthcare, finance, and consumer analytics where decision-making requires clear, interpretable insights. DSClustering aims to bridge this gap by assigning clusters based on belief functions from Dempster-Shafer theory, which allows it to generate rule-based explanations for each data point's cluster assignment. Through detailed experiments on real-world datasets, including consumer behavior and airline satisfaction data, we evaluate DSClustering against traditional algorithms using key metrics such as Silhouette score, Rand index and Dunn's index for clustering validity. The results indicate that DSClustering not only performs competitively but also offers a clear interpretative layer, making it suitable for applications where understanding model outputs is as essential as the accuracy of the outputs themselves. This work underscores the increasing importance of interpretability in machine learning, particularly in unsupervised learning, where transparency is typically challenging to achieve. DSClustering demonstrates a promising approach for balancing robust clustering with user-oriented interpretability, potentially encouraging broader adoption of interpretable clustering models in data-critical industries.

AB  - Purpose: This study investigates the efficiency of a machine learning model integrating least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) feature selection with ensemble learning in predicting recurrence risk and supporting personalized treatment decisions in breast cancer patients.<br /> Materials and Methods: Clinical data from 1,131 breast cancer patients (1,056 nonrecurrent and 75 recurrent) were collected from Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital's electronic health record system. After preprocessing and standardization, LASSO was applied for feature selection. An ensemble learning model was developed based on multiple machine learning algorithms, with SHAP (Shapley additive explanations) used for interpretability. Results: The ensemble model achieved an AUC of 0.817, outperforming the best single model (AUC 0.711), demonstrating improved predictive accuracy and stability. LASSO identified six key predictors: regional lymph node positivity, ER status, Ki-67, lymphovascular invasion, tumor size, and age at diagnosis. SHAP analysis enhanced transparency by quantifying the contribution of each feature to recurrence risk, improving clinical understanding.<br /> Conclusion: This LASSO-enhanced ensemble model significantly improves the accuracy and interpretability of breast cancer recurrence prediction. By identifying individualized recurrence risks through SHAP analysis, the model supports more precise, data-driven clinical decision-making. These findings demonstrate its potential as a clinical decision support tool for guiding personalized treatment strategies, contributing to more effective breast cancer management.

AB  - In the field of healthcare, artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted solutions can be viewed with anxiety or apprehension, thus transparency and trust-building are essential. AI is often invisible (and potentially undisclosed) to users, violating the ethical principle of transparency -- particularly with respect to informed disclosure. This Brief Technical Report describes the creation of a novel, patient-centric prototype AI transparency tool (AI Facts Label) using the United States Drug Facts Label as a model. The prototype was then populated with lay language in the context of a hypothetical AI-assisted wearable medical device. Using lay language amid a defined graphic template that could be globally harmonized, the AI Facts Label is a communication tool that honors the ethical principle of transparency and could potentially aid readers (patients and healthcare workers) in understanding the use of AI in a specific product. AI Facts Labels have the potential to be used globally (adapted to local language) in clinical research settings as well as commercial settings as a transparency tool that discloses when a system is AI-assisted. AI Facts Labels could also be used as a communication tool in other settings such as general consumer electronics (e.g., televisions, household appliances, mobile phones) and non-healthcare apps.

AB  - Background: Triage and treatment prioritization based on urgency are essential tools for managing patient flow. In Germany, this is most commonly conducted using the Manchester Triage System (MTS). Objective: This study investigates the potential benefits of integrating intelligent components into existing triage processes. Materials and methods: A selective literature review was conducted to identify and assess the opportunities and limitations of applying artificial intelligence (AI) in the context of triage. Results: By utilizing data routinely collected during the triage process, AI can improve the accuracy of triage decisions . The approaches differ primarily in terms of the transparency of their decision-making processes. Conclusion: Intelligent systems can technically enhance acuity assessment. However, there are significant barriers and concerns regarding implementation, particularly from legal and ethical perspectives. Furthermore, intelligent triage tools have not yet been sufficiently studied for application in the German healthcare system. When outcomes are equivalent, AI approaches with higher transparency should be preferred.

AB  - Despite Artificial Intelligence (AI) being a leading technology in biomedical research, real-life implementation of AI-based Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) tools into the clinical setting is still remote due to unstandardized practices during development. However, few or no attempts have been made to propose a reproducible CAD development workflow for 3D MRI data. In this paper, we present the development of an easily reproducible and reliable CAD tool using the Clinica and MONAI frameworks that were developed to introduce standardized practices in medical imaging. A Deep Learning (DL) algorithm was trained to detect frontotemporal dementia (FTD) on data from the NIFD database to ensure reproducibility. The DL model yielded 0.80 accuracy (95% confidence intervals: 0.64, 0.91), 1 sensitivity, 0.6 specificity, 0.83 F1-score, and 0.86 AUC, achieving a comparable performance with other FTD classification approaches. Explainable AI methods were applied to understand AI behavior and to identify regions of the images where the DL model misbehaves. Attention maps highlighted that its decision was driven by hallmarking brain areas for FTD and helped us to understand how to improve FTD detection. The proposed standardized methodology could be useful for benchmark comparison in FTD classification. AI-based CAD tools should be developed with the goal of standardizing pipelines, as varying pre-processing and training methods, along with the absence of model behavior explanations, negatively impact regulators' attitudes towards CAD. The adoption of common best practices for neuroimaging data analysis is a step toward fast evaluation of efficacy and safety of CAD and may accelerate the adoption of AI products in the healthcare system.

AB  - Machine learning (ML) is increasingly applied to Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to solve clinical prediction tasks. Although many ML models perform promisingly, issues with model transparency and interpretability limit their adoption in clinical practice. Directly using existing explainable ML techniques in clinical settings can be challenging. Through literature surveys and collaborations with six clinicians with an average of 17 years of clinical experience, we identified three key challenges, including clinicians' unfamiliarity with ML features, lack of contextual information, and the need for cohort-level evidence. Following an iterative design process, we further designed and developed VBridge, a visual analytics tool that seamlessly incorporates ML explanations into clinicians' decision-making workflow. The system includes a novel hierarchical display of contribution-based feature explanations and enriched interactions that connect the dots between ML features, explanations, and data. We demonstrated the effectiveness of VBridge through two case studies and expert interviews with four clinicians, showing that visually associating model explanations with patients' situational records can help clinicians better interpret and use model predictions when making clinician decisions. We further derived a list of design implications for developing future explainable ML tools to support clinical decision-making.

AB  - Our research evaluates advanced artificial (AI) methodologies to enhance diagnostic accuracy in pulmonary radiography. Utilizing DenseNet121 and ResNet50, we analyzed 108,948 chest X-ray images from 32,717 patients and DenseNet121 achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 94% in identifying the conditions of pneumothorax and oedema. The model's performance surpassed that of expert radiologists, though further improvements are necessary for diagnosing complex conditions such as emphysema, effusion, and hernia. Clinical validation integrating Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Named Entity Recognition (NER) demonstrated the potential of natural language processing (NLP) in clinical workflows. The NER system achieved a precision of 92% and a recall of 88%. Sentiment analysis using DistilBERT provided a nuanced understanding of clinical notes, which is essential for refining diagnostic decisions. XGBoost and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) enhanced feature extraction and model interpretability. Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and occlusion sensitivity analysis further enriched transparency, enabling healthcare providers to trust AI predictions. These AI techniques reduced processing times by 60% and annotation errors by 75%, setting a new benchmark for efficiency in thoracic diagnostics. The research explored the transformative potential of AI in medical imaging, advancing traditional diagnostics and accelerating medical evaluations in clinical settings.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Major trauma ranks among the leading causes of mortality and handicap in both developing and developed countries, consuming substantial healthcare resources. Its unpredictable nature and diverse clinical presentations often lead to rapid and challenging-to-predict changes in patient conditions. An increasing number of models have been developed to address this challenge. Given our access to extensive and relatively comprehensive data, we seek assistance in making a meaningful contribution to this topic. This study aims to leverage artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) to forecast potential adverse effects in major trauma patients. Methods: This retrospective analysis considered major trauma patient admitted to Chi Mei Medical Center from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2019. Results: A total of 5521 major trauma patients were analyzed. Among five AI models tested, XGBoost showed the best performance (AUC 0.748), outperforming traditional clinical scores such as ISS and GCS. The model was deployed as a web-based application integrated into the hospital information system. Preliminary clinical use demonstrated improved efficiency, interpretability through SHAP analysis, and positive user feedback from healthcare professionals. Conclusions: This study presents a predictive model for estimating recovery probabilities in severe burn patients, effectively integrated into the hospital information system (HIS) without complex computations. Clinical use has shown improved efficiency and quality. Future efforts will expand predictions to include complications and treatment outcomes, aiming for broader applications as technology advances.

Objective: This perspective paper, grounded in a narrative review, explores the ethical dilemmas associated with AI in emergency surgery and proposes future directions for its responsible and equitable integration. Methods: A comprehensive narrative review was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, covering the literature published from January 2010 to December 2024. We focused on peer-reviewed articles discussing AI in surgical or emergency care and highlighting ethical, legal, or regulatory issues. A thematic analysis was used to synthesize the main ethical challenges. Results: Key ethical concerns identified include issues of accountability in AI-assisted decision-making, the "black box" effect and bias in algorithmic design, data privacy and protection, and the lack of global regulatory coherence. Thematic domains were developed around autonomy, beneficence, justice, transparency, and informed consent. Conclusions: Responsible AI implementation in emergency surgery requires transparent and explainable models, diverse and representative datasets, robust consent frameworks, and clear guidelines for liability and oversight. Interdisciplinary collaboration is essential to align technological innovation with patient-centered and ethically sound clinical practice.
