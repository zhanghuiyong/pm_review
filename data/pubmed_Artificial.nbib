TI  - Emerging role of deep learning-based artificial intelligence in tumor pathology.
PG  - 154-166
LID - 10.1002/cac2.12012 [doi]
AB  - The development of digital pathology and progression of state-of-the-art 
      algorithms for computer vision have led to increasing interest in the use of 
      artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep learning (DL)-based AI, in tumor 
      pathology. The DL-based algorithms have been developed to conduct all kinds of 
      work involved in tumor pathology, including tumor diagnosis, subtyping, grading, 
      staging, and prognostic prediction, as well as the identification of pathological 
      features, biomarkers and genetic changes. The applications of AI in pathology not 
      only contribute to improve diagnostic accuracy and objectivity but also reduce 
      the workload of pathologists and subsequently enable them to spend additional 
      time on high-level decision-making tasks. In addition, AI is useful for 
      pathologists to meet the requirements of precision oncology. However, there are 
      still some challenges relating to the implementation of AI, including the issues 
      of algorithm validation and interpretability, computing systems, the unbelieving 
      attitude of pathologists, clinicians and patients, as well as regulators and 
      reimbursements. Herein, we present an overview on how AI-based approaches could 
      be integrated into the workflow of pathologists and discuss the challenges and 
      perspectives of the implementation of AI in tumor pathology.

TI  - ChatGPT Utility in Healthcare Education, Research, and Practice: Systematic 
      Review on the Promising Perspectives and Valid Concerns.
LID - 10.3390/healthcare11060887 [doi]
LID - 887
AB  - ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence (AI)-based conversational large language 
      model (LLM). The potential applications of LLMs in health care education, 
      research, and practice could be promising if the associated valid concerns are 
      proactively examined and addressed. The current systematic review aimed to 
      investigate the utility of ChatGPT in health care education, research, and 
      practice and to highlight its potential limitations. Using the PRIMSA guidelines, 
      a systematic search was conducted to retrieve English records in PubMed/MEDLINE 
      and Google Scholar (published research or preprints) that examined ChatGPT in the 
      context of health care education, research, or practice. A total of 60 records 
      were eligible for inclusion. Benefits of ChatGPT were cited in 51/60 (85.0%) 
      records and included: (1) improved scientific writing and enhancing research 
      equity and versatility; (2) utility in health care research (efficient analysis 
      of datasets, code generation, literature reviews, saving time to focus on 
      experimental design, and drug discovery and development); (3) benefits in health 
      care practice (streamlining the workflow, cost saving, documentation, 
      personalized medicine, and improved health literacy); and (4) benefits in health 
      care education including improved personalized learning and the focus on critical 
      thinking and problem-based learning. Concerns regarding ChatGPT use were stated 
      in 58/60 (96.7%) records including ethical, copyright, transparency, and legal 
      issues, the risk of bias, plagiarism, lack of originality, inaccurate content 
      with risk of hallucination, limited knowledge, incorrect citations, cybersecurity 
      issues, and risk of infodemics. The promising applications of ChatGPT can induce 
      paradigm shifts in health care education, research, and practice. However, the 
      embrace of this AI chatbot should be conducted with extreme caution considering 
      its potential limitations. As it currently stands, ChatGPT does not qualify to be 
      listed as an author in scientific articles unless the ICMJE/COPE guidelines are 
      revised or amended. An initiative involving all stakeholders in health care 
      education, research, and practice is urgently needed. This will help to set a 
      code of ethics to guide the responsible use of ChatGPT among other LLMs in health 
      care and academia.

TI  - Explainable AI for Bioinformatics: Methods, Tools and Applications.
LID - bbad236 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/bib/bbad236 [doi]
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) systems utilizing deep neural networks and machine 
      learning (ML) algorithms are widely used for solving critical problems in 
      bioinformatics, biomedical informatics and precision medicine. However, complex 
      ML models that are often perceived as opaque and black-box methods make it 
      difficult to understand the reasoning behind their decisions. This lack of 
      transparency can be a challenge for both end-users and decision-makers, as well 
      as AI developers. In sensitive areas such as healthcare, explainability and 
      accountability are not only desirable properties but also legally required for AI 
      systems that can have a significant impact on human lives. Fairness is another 
      growing concern, as algorithmic decisions should not show bias or discrimination 
      towards certain groups or individuals based on sensitive attributes. Explainable 
      AI (XAI) aims to overcome the opaqueness of black-box models and to provide 
      transparency in how AI systems make decisions. Interpretable ML models can 
      explain how they make predictions and identify factors that influence their 
      outcomes. However, the majority of the state-of-the-art interpretable ML methods 
      are domain-agnostic and have evolved from fields such as computer vision, 
      automated reasoning or statistics, making direct application to bioinformatics 
      problems challenging without customization and domain adaptation. In this paper, 
      we discuss the importance of explainability and algorithmic transparency in the 
      context of bioinformatics. We provide an overview of model-specific and 
      model-agnostic interpretable ML methods and tools and outline their potential 
      limitations. We discuss how existing interpretable ML methods can be customized 
      and fit to bioinformatics research problems. Further, through case studies in 
      bioimaging, cancer genomics and text mining, we demonstrate how XAI methods can 
      improve transparency and decision fairness. Our review aims at providing valuable 
      insights and serving as a starting point for researchers wanting to enhance 
      explainability and decision transparency while solving bioinformatics problems.

AB  - Most drugs entering clinical trials fail, often related to an incomplete 
      understanding of the mechanisms governing drug response. Machine learning 
      techniques hold immense promise for better drug response predictions, but most 
      have not reached clinical practice due to their lack of interpretability and 
      their focus on monotherapies. We address these challenges by developing DrugCell, 
      an interpretable deep learning model of human cancer cells trained on the 
      responses of 1,235 tumor cell lines to 684 drugs. Tumor genotypes induce states 
      in cellular subsystems that are integrated with drug structure to predict 
      response to therapy and, simultaneously, learn biological mechanisms underlying 
      the drug response. DrugCell predictions are accurate in cell lines and also 
      stratify clinical outcomes. Analysis of DrugCell mechanisms leads directly to the 
      design of synergistic drug combinations, which we validate systematically by 
      combinatorial CRISPR, drug-drug screening in vitro, and patient-derived 
      xenografts. DrugCell provides a blueprint for constructing interpretable models 
      for predictive medicine.

AB  - Substantial progress has been made in using deep learning for cancer detection 
      and diagnosis in medical images. Yet, there is limited success on prediction of 
      treatment response and outcomes, which has important implications for 
      personalized treatment strategies. A significant hurdle for clinical translation 
      of current data-driven deep learning models is lack of interpretability, often 
      attributable to a disconnect from the underlying pathobiology. Here, we present a 
      biology-guided deep learning approach that enables simultaneous prediction of the 
      tumor immune and stromal microenvironment status as well as treatment outcomes 
      from medical images. We validate the model for predicting prognosis of gastric 
      cancer and the benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy in a multi-center international 
      study. Further, the model predicts response to immune checkpoint inhibitors and 
      complements clinically approved biomarkers. Importantly, our model identifies a 
      subset of mismatch repair-deficient tumors that are non-responsive to 
      immunotherapy and may inform the selection of patients for combination 
      treatments.

AB  - Glioma represents a dominant primary intracranial malignancy in the central 
      nervous system. Artificial intelligence that mainly includes machine learning, 
      and deep learning computational approaches, presents a unique opportunity to 
      enhance clinical management of glioma through improving tumor segmentation, 
      diagnosis, differentiation, grading, treatment, prediction of clinical outcomes 
      (prognosis, and recurrence), molecular features, clinical classification, 
      characterization of the tumor microenvironment, and drug discovery. A growing 
      body of recent studies apply artificial intelligence-based models to disparate 
      data sources of glioma, covering imaging modalities, digital pathology, 
      high-throughput multi-omics data (especially emerging single-cell RNA sequencing 
      and spatial transcriptome), etc. While these early findings are promising, future 
      studies are required to normalize artificial intelligence-based models to improve 
      the generalizability and interpretability of the results. Despite prominent 
      issues, targeted clinical application of artificial intelligence approaches in 
      glioma will facilitate the development of precision medicine of this field. If 
      these challenges can be overcome, artificial intelligence has the potential to 
      profoundly change the way patients with or at risk of glioma are provided with 
      more rational care.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed pharmacological research through 
      machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing. These 
      advancements have greatly influenced drug discovery, development, and precision 
      medicine. AI algorithms analyze vast biomedical data identifying potential drug 
      targets, predicting efficacy, and optimizing lead compounds. AI has diverse 
      applications in pharmacological research, including target identification, drug 
      repurposing, virtual screening, de novo drug design, toxicity prediction, and 
      personalized medicine. AI improves patient selection, trial design, and real-time 
      data analysis in clinical trials, leading to enhanced safety and efficacy 
      outcomes. Post-marketing surveillance utilizes AI-based systems to monitor 
      adverse events, detect drug interactions, and support pharmacovigilance efforts. 
      Machine learning models extract patterns from complex datasets, enabling accurate 
      predictions and informed decision-making, thus accelerating drug discovery. Deep 
      learning, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNN), excels in image 
      analysis, aiding biomarker identification and optimizing drug formulation. 
      Natural language processing facilitates the mining and analysis of scientific 
      literature, unlocking valuable insights and information. However, the adoption of 
      AI in pharmacological research raises ethical considerations. Ensuring data 
      privacy and security, addressing algorithm bias and transparency, obtaining 
      informed consent, and maintaining human oversight in decision-making are crucial 
      ethical concerns. The responsible deployment of AI necessitates robust frameworks 
      and regulations. The future of AI in pharmacological research is promising, with 
      integration with emerging technologies like genomics, proteomics, and 
      metabolomics offering the potential for personalized medicine and targeted 
      therapies. Collaboration among academia, industry, and regulatory bodies is 
      essential for the ethical implementation of AI in drug discovery and development. 
      Continuous research and development in AI techniques and comprehensive training 
      programs will empower scientists and healthcare professionals to fully exploit 
      AI's potential, leading to improved patient outcomes and innovative 
      pharmacological interventions.

AB  - NOTCH1, NOTCH2, NOTCH3 and NOTCH4 are transmembrane receptors that transduce 
      juxtacrine signals of the delta‑like canonical Notch ligand (DLL)1, DLL3, DLL4, 
      jagged canonical Notch ligand (JAG)1 and JAG2. Canonical Notch signaling 
      activates the transcription of BMI1 proto‑oncogene polycomb ring finger, cyclin 
      D1, CD44, cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1A, hes family bHLH transcription 
      factor 1, hes related family bHLH transcription factor with YRPW motif 1, MYC, 
      NOTCH3, RE1 silencing transcription factor and transcription factor 7 in a 
      cellular context‑dependent manner, while non‑canonical Notch signaling activates 
      NF‑κB and Rac family small GTPase 1. Notch signaling is aberrantly activated in 
      breast cancer, non‑small‑cell lung cancer and hematological malignancies, such as 
      T‑cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and diffuse large B‑cell lymphoma. However, 
      Notch signaling is inactivated in small‑cell lung cancer and squamous cell 
      carcinomas. Loss‑of‑function NOTCH1 mutations are early events during esophageal 
      tumorigenesis, whereas gain‑of‑function NOTCH1 mutations are late events during 
      T‑cell leukemogenesis and B‑cell lymphomagenesis. Notch signaling cascades 
      crosstalk with fibroblast growth factor and WNT signaling cascades in the tumor 
      microenvironment to maintain cancer stem cells and remodel the tumor 
      microenvironment. The Notch signaling network exerts oncogenic and 
      tumor‑suppressive effects in a cancer stage‑ or (sub)type‑dependent manner. 
      Small‑molecule γ‑secretase inhibitors (AL101, MRK‑560, nirogacestat and others) 
      and antibody‑based biologics targeting Notch ligands or receptors [ABT‑165, AMG 
      119, rovalpituzumab tesirine (Rova‑T) and others] have been developed as 
      investigational drugs. The DLL3‑targeting antibody‑drug conjugate (ADC) Rova‑T, 
      and DLL3‑targeting chimeric antigen receptor‑modified T cells (CAR‑Ts), AMG 119, 
      are promising anti‑cancer therapeutics, as are other ADCs or CAR‑Ts targeting 
      tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 17, CD19, CD22, CD30, CD79B, 
      CD205, Claudin 18.2, fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)2, FGFR3, 
      receptor‑type tyrosine‑protein kinase FLT3, HER2, hepatocyte growth factor 
      receptor, NECTIN4, inactive tyrosine‑protein kinase 7, inactive tyrosine‑protein 
      kinase transmembrane receptor ROR1 and tumor‑associated calcium signal transducer 
      2. ADCs and CAR‑Ts could alter the therapeutic framework for refractory cancers, 
      especially diffuse‑type gastric cancer, ovarian cancer and pancreatic cancer with 
      peritoneal dissemination. Phase III clinical trials of Rova‑T for patients with 
      small‑cell lung cancer and a phase III clinical trial of nirogacestat for 
      patients with desmoid tumors are ongoing. Integration of human intelligence, 
      cognitive computing and explainable artificial intelligence is necessary to 
      construct a Notch‑related knowledge‑base and optimize Notch‑targeted therapy for 
      patients with cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence-enhanced electrocardiogram (AI-ECG) analysis 
      shows promise to detect biventricular pathophysiology. However, AI-ECG analysis 
      remains underexplored in congenital heart disease (CHD). OBJECTIVES: The purpose 
      of this study was to develop and externally validate an AI-ECG model to predict 
      cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR)-defined biventricular 
      dysfunction/dilation in patients with CHD. METHODS: We trained (80%) and tested 
      (20%) a convolutional neural network on paired ECG-CMRs (≤30 days apart) from 
      patients with and without CHD to detect left ventricular (LV) dysfunction 
      (ejection fraction ≤40%), RV dysfunction (ejection fraction ≤35%), and LV and RV 
      dilation (end-diastolic volume z-score ≥4). Performance was assessed during 
      internal testing and external validation on an outside health care system using 
      area under receiver-operating curve (AUROC) and area under precision recall 
      curve. RESULTS: The internal and external cohorts comprised 8,584 ECG-CMR pairs 
      (n = 4,941; median CMR age 20.7 years) and 909 ECG-CMR pairs (n = 746; median CMR 
      age 25.4 years), respectively. Model performance was similar for internal testing 
      (AUROC: LV dysfunction 0.87; LV dilation 0.86; RV dysfunction 0.88; RV dilation 
      0.81) and external validation (AUROC: LV dysfunction 0.89; LV dilation 0.83; RV 
      dysfunction 0.82; RV dilation 0.80). Model performance was lowest in functionally 
      single ventricle patients. Tetralogy of Fallot patients predicted to be at high 
      risk of ventricular dysfunction had lower survival (P < 0.001). Model 
      explainability via saliency mapping revealed that lateral precordial leads 
      influence all outcome predictions, with high-risk features including QRS widening 
      and T-wave inversions for RV dysfunction/dilation. CONCLUSIONS: AI-ECG shows 
      promise to predict biventricular dysfunction/dilation, which may help inform CMR 
      timing in CHD.

AB  - Drug repurposing-identifying new therapeutic uses for approved drugs-is often a 
      serendipitous and opportunistic endeavour to expand the use of drugs for new 
      diseases. The clinical utility of drug-repurposing artificial intelligence (AI) 
      models remains limited because these models focus narrowly on diseases for which 
      some drugs already exist. Here we introduce TxGNN, a graph foundation model for 
      zero-shot drug repurposing, identifying therapeutic candidates even for diseases 
      with limited treatment options or no existing drugs. Trained on a medical 
      knowledge graph, TxGNN uses a graph neural network and metric learning module to 
      rank drugs as potential indications and contraindications for 17,080 diseases. 
      When benchmarked against 8 methods, TxGNN improves prediction accuracy for 
      indications by 49.2% and contraindications by 35.1% under stringent zero-shot 
      evaluation. To facilitate model interpretation, TxGNN's Explainer module offers 
      transparent insights into multi-hop medical knowledge paths that form TxGNN's 
      predictive rationales. Human evaluation of TxGNN's Explainer showed that TxGNN's 
      predictions and explanations perform encouragingly on multiple axes of 
      performance beyond accuracy. Many of TxGNN's new predictions align well with 
      off-label prescriptions that clinicians previously made in a large healthcare 
      system. TxGNN's drug-repurposing predictions are accurate, consistent with 
      off-label drug use, and can be investigated by human experts through multi-hop 
      interpretable rationales.

AB  - Despite advances in precision oncology, clinical decision-making still relies on 
      limited variables and expert knowledge. To address this limitation, we combined 
      multimodal real-world data and explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) to 
      introduce AI-derived (AID) markers for clinical decision support. We used xAI to 
      decode the outcome of 15,726 patients across 38 solid cancer entities based on 
      350 markers, including clinical records, image-derived body compositions, and 
      mutational tumor profiles. xAI determined the prognostic contribution of each 
      clinical marker at the patient level and identified 114 key markers that 
      accounted for 90% of the neural network's decision process. Moreover, xAI enabled 
      us to uncover 1,373 prognostic interactions between markers. Our approach was 
      validated in an independent cohort of 3,288 patients with lung cancer from a US 
      nationwide electronic health record-derived database. These results show the 
      potential of xAI to transform the assessment of clinical variables and enable 
      personalized, data-driven cancer care.

AB  - Clinical annotations are one of the most popular resources available on the 
      Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB). Each clinical annotation summarizes 
      the association between variant-drug pairs, shows relevant findings from the 
      curated literature, and is assigned a level of evidence (LOE) to indicate the 
      strength of support for that association. Evidence from the pharmacogenomic 
      literature is curated into PharmGKB as variant annotations, which can be used to 
      create new clinical annotations or added to existing clinical annotations. This 
      means that the same clinical annotation can be worked on by multiple curators 
      over time. As more evidence is curated into PharmGKB, the task of maintaining 
      consistency when assessing all the available evidence and assigning an LOE 
      becomes increasingly difficult. To remedy this, a scoring system has been 
      developed to automate LOE assignment to clinical annotations. Variant annotations 
      are scored according to certain attributes, including study size, reported P 
      value, and whether the variant annotation supports or fails to find an 
      association. Clinical guidelines or US Food and Drug Administration 
      (FDA)-approved drug labels which give variant-specific prescribing guidance are 
      also scored. The scores of all annotations attached to a clinical annotation are 
      summed together to give a total score for the clinical annotation, which is used 
      to calculate an LOE. Overall, the system increases transparency, consistency, and 
      reproducibility in LOE assignment to clinical annotations. In combination with 
      increased standardization of how clinical annotations are written, use of this 
      scoring system helps to ensure that PharmGKB clinical annotations continue to be 
      a robust source of pharmacogenomic information.

AB  - In this review we address to what extent computational techniques can augment our 
      ability to predict toxicity. The first section provides a brief history of 
      empirical observations on toxicity dating back to the dawn of Sumerian 
      civilization. Interestingly, the concept of dose emerged very early on, leading 
      up to the modern emphasis on kinetic properties, which in turn encodes the 
      insight that toxicity is not solely a property of a compound but instead depends 
      on the interaction with the host organism. The next logical step is the current 
      conception of evaluating drugs from a personalized medicine point of view. We 
      review recent work on integrating what could be referred to as classical 
      pharmacokinetic analysis with emerging systems biology approaches incorporating 
      multiple omics data. These systems approaches employ advanced statistical 
      analytical data processing complemented with machine learning techniques and use 
      both pharmacokinetic and omics data. We find that such integrated approaches not 
      only provide improved predictions of toxicity but also enable mechanistic 
      interpretations of the molecular mechanisms underpinning toxicity and drug 
      resistance. We conclude the chapter by discussing some of the main challenges, 
      such as how to balance the inherent tension between the predicitive capacity of 
      models, which in practice amounts to constraining the number of features in the 
      models versus allowing for rich mechanistic interpretability, i.e., equipping 
      models with numerous molecular features. This challenge also requires 
      patient-specific predictions on toxicity, which in turn requires proper 
      stratification of patients as regards how they respond, with or without adverse 
      toxic effects. In summary, the transformation of the ancient concept of dose is 
      currently successfully operationalized using rich integrative data encoded in 
      patient-specific models.

AB  - Systems medicine (SM) has emerged as a powerful tool for studying the human body 
      at the systems level with the aim of improving our understanding, prevention and 
      treatment of complex diseases. Being able to automatically extract relevant 
      features needed for a given task from high-dimensional, heterogeneous data, deep 
      learning (DL) holds great promise in this endeavour. This review paper addresses 
      the main developments of DL algorithms and a set of general topics where DL is 
      decisive, namely, within the SM landscape. It discusses how DL can be applied to 
      SM with an emphasis on the applications to predictive, preventive and precision 
      medicine. Several key challenges have been highlighted including delivering 
      clinical impact and improving interpretability. We used some prototypical 
      examples to highlight the relevance and significance of the adoption of DL in SM, 
      one of them is involving the creation of a model for personalized Parkinson's 
      disease. The review offers valuable insights and informs the research in DL and 
      SM.

AB  - We introduce a pioneering approach that integrates pathology imaging with 
      transcriptomics and proteomics to identify predictive histology features 
      associated with critical clinical outcomes in cancer. We utilize 2,755 
      H&E-stained histopathological slides from 657 patients across 6 cancer types from 
      CPTAC. Our models effectively recapitulate distinctions readily made by human 
      pathologists: tumor vs. normal (AUROC = 0.995) and tissue-of-origin (AUROC = 
      0.979). We further investigate predictive power on tasks not normally performed 
      from H&E alone, including TP53 prediction and pathologic stage. Importantly, we 
      describe predictive morphologies not previously utilized in a clinical setting. 
      The incorporation of transcriptomics and proteomics identifies pathway-level 
      signatures and cellular processes driving predictive histology features. Model 
      generalizability and interpretability is confirmed using TCGA. We propose a 
      classification system for these tasks, and suggest potential clinical 
      applications for this integrated human and machine learning approach. A publicly 
      available web-based platform implements these models.

TI  - A Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial of Microbiome-Based Artificial 
      Intelligence-Assisted Personalized Diet vs Low-Fermentable Oligosaccharides, 
      Disaccharides, Monosaccharides, and Polyols Diet: A Novel Approach for the 
      Management of Irritable Bowel Syndrome.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Personalized management strategies are pivotal in addressing 
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This multicenter randomized controlled trial 
      focuses on comparing the efficacy of a microbiome-based artificial 
      intelligence-assisted personalized diet (PD) with a low-fermentable 
      oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols diet (FODMAP) for 
      IBS management. METHODS: One hundred twenty-one patients participated, with 70 
      assigned to the PD group and 51 to the FODMAP diet group. IBS subtypes, 
      demographics, symptom severity (IBS-SSS), anxiety, depression, and quality of 
      life (IBS-QOL) were evaluated. Both interventions spanned 6 weeks. The trial's 
      primary outcome was the within-individual difference in IBS-SSS compared between 
      intervention groups. RESULTS: For the primary outcome, there was a change in 
      IBS-SSS of -112.7 for those in the PD group vs -99.9 for those in the FODMAP diet 
      group ( P = 0.29). Significant improvement occurred in IBS-SSS scores ( P < 
      0.001), frequency ( P < 0.001), abdominal distension ( P < 0.001), and life 
      interference ( P < 0.001) in both groups. In addition, there were significant 
      improvements in anxiety levels and IBS-QOL scores for both groups ( P < 0.001). 
      Importantly, PD was effective in reducing IBS SSS scores across all IBS subtypes 
      IBS-Constipation (IBS-C; P < 0.001), IBS-Diarrhea (IBS-D; P = 0.01), and 
      IBS-Mixed (IBS-M; P < 0.001) while FODMAP diet exhibited comparable improvements 
      in IBS-C ( P = 0.004) and IBS-M ( P < 0.001). PD intervention significantly 
      improved IBS-QOL scores for all subtypes (IBS-C [ P < 0.001], IBS-D [ P < 0.001], 
      and IBS-M [ P = 0.008]) while the FODMAP diet did so for the IBS-C ( P = 0.004) 
      and IBS-D ( P = 0.022). Notably, PD intervention led to significant microbiome 
      diversity shifts ( P < 0.05) and taxa alterations compared with FODMAP diet. 
      DISCUSSION: The artificial intelligence-assisted PD emerges as a promising 
      approach for comprehensive IBS management. With its ability to address individual 
      variation, the PD approach demonstrates significant symptom relief, enhanced QOL, 
      and notable diversity shifts in the gut microbiome, making it a valuable strategy 
      in the evolving landscape of IBS care.

AB  - The growth of multi-omic tumour profile datasets along with knowledge of genome 
      regulatory networks has created an unprecedented opportunity to advance precision 
      oncology. Achieving this goal requires computational methods that can make sense 
      of and combine heterogeneous data sources. Interpretability and integration of 
      prior knowledge is of particular relevance for genomic models to minimize 
      ungeneralizable models, promote rational treatment design, and make use of sparse 
      genetic mutation data. While networks have long been used to capture genomic 
      interactions at the levels of genes, proteins, and pathways, the use of networks 
      in precision oncology is relatively new. In this chapter, I provide an 
      introduction to network-based approaches used to integrate multi-modal data 
      sources for patient stratification and patient classification. There is a 
      particular emphasis on methods using patient similarity networks (PSNs) as part 
      of the design. I separately discuss strategies for inferring driver mutations 
      from individual patient mutation data. Finally, I discuss challenges and 
      opportunities the field will need to overcome to achieve its full potential, with 
      an outlook towards a clinic of the future.

AB  - Standard-of-care treatment regimens have long been designed for maximal cell 
      killing, yet these strategies often fail when applied to metastatic cancers due 
      to the emergence of drug resistance. Adaptive treatment strategies have been 
      developed as an alternative approach, dynamically adjusting treatment to suppress 
      the growth of treatment-resistant populations and thereby delay, or even prevent, 
      tumor progression. Promising clinical results in prostate cancer indicate the 
      potential to optimize adaptive treatment protocols. Here, we applied deep 
      reinforcement learning (DRL) to guide adaptive drug scheduling and demonstrated 
      that these treatment schedules can outperform the current adaptive protocols in a 
      mathematical model calibrated to prostate cancer dynamics, more than doubling the 
      time to progression. The DRL strategies were robust to patient variability, 
      including both tumor dynamics and clinical monitoring schedules. The DRL 
      framework could produce interpretable, adaptive strategies based on a single 
      tumor burden threshold, replicating and informing optimal treatment strategies. 
      The DRL framework had no knowledge of the underlying mathematical tumor model, 
      demonstrating the capability of DRL to help develop treatment strategies in novel 
      or complex settings. Finally, a proposed five-step pathway, which combined 
      mechanistic modeling with the DRL framework and integrated conventional tools to 
      improve interpretability compared with traditional "black-box" DRL models, could 
      allow translation of this approach to the clinic. Overall, the proposed framework 
      generated personalized treatment schedules that consistently outperformed 
      clinical standard-of-care protocols. SIGNIFICANCE: Generation of interpretable 
      and personalized adaptive treatment schedules using a deep reinforcement 
      framework that interacts with a virtual patient model overcomes the limitations 
      of standardized strategies caused by heterogeneous treatment responses.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mechanisms of myocardial ischemia in obstructive and non-obstructive 
      coronary artery disease (CAD), and the interplay between clinical, functional, 
      biological and psycho-social features, are still far to be fully elucidated. 
      OBJECTIVES: To develop a machine-learning (ML) model for the supervised 
      prediction of obstructive versus non-obstructive CAD. METHODS: From the EVA 
      study, we analysed adults hospitalized for IHD undergoing conventional coronary 
      angiography (CCA). Non-obstructive CAD was defined by a stenosis < 50% in one or 
      more vessels. Baseline clinical and psycho-socio-cultural characteristics were 
      used for computing a Rockwood and Mitnitski frailty index, and a gender score 
      according to GENESIS-PRAXY methodology. Serum concentration of inflammatory 
      cytokines was measured with a multiplex flow cytometry assay. Through an XGBoost 
      classifier combined with an explainable artificial intelligence tool (SHAP), we 
      identified the most influential features in discriminating obstructive versus 
      non-obstructive CAD. RESULTS: Among the overall EVA cohort (n = 509), 311 
      individuals (mean age 67 ± 11 years, 38% females; 67% obstructive CAD) with 
      complete data were analysed. The ML-based model (83% accuracy and 87% precision) 
      showed that while obstructive CAD was associated with higher frailty index, older 
      age and a cytokine signature characterized by IL-1β, IL-12p70 and IL-33, 
      non-obstructive CAD was associated with a higher gender score (i.e., social 
      characteristics traditionally ascribed to women) and with a cytokine signature 
      characterized by IL-18, IL-8, IL-23. CONCLUSIONS: Integrating clinical, 
      biological, and psycho-social features, we have optimized a sex- and 
      gender-unbiased model that discriminates obstructive and non-obstructive CAD. 
      Further mechanistic studies will shed light on the biological plausibility of 
      these associations. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02737982.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Anaphylaxis is a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic 
      reaction that requires rapid identification and intervention. Current management 
      includes early recognition, prompt administration of epinephrine, and immediate 
      medical attention. However, challenges remain in accurate diagnosis, timely 
      treatment, and personalized care. This article reviews the integration of 
      artificial intelligence and machine learning in enhancing anaphylaxis management. 
      RECENT FINDINGS: Artificial intelligence and machine learning can analyze vast 
      datasets to identify patterns and predict anaphylactic episodes, improve 
      diagnostic accuracy through image and biomarker analysis, and personalize 
      treatment plans. Artificial intelligence-powered wearable devices and decision 
      support systems can facilitate real-time monitoring and early intervention. The 
      ethical considerations of artificial intelligence use, including data privacy, 
      transparency, and bias mitigation, are also discussed. SUMMARY: Future directions 
      include the development of predictive models, enhanced diagnostic tools, and 
      artificial intelligence-driven educational resources. By leveraging artificial 
      intelligence and machine learning, healthcare providers can improve the 
      management of anaphylaxis, ensuring better patient outcomes and advancing 
      personalized medicine.

AB  - BACKGROUND: As diagnostic and prognostic models developed by traditional 
      statistics perform poorly in real-world, artificial intelligence (AI) and Big 
      Data (BD) may improve the supply chain of heart transplantation (HTx), allocation 
      opportunities, correct treatments, and finally optimize HTx outcome. We explored 
      available studies, and discussed opportunities and limits of medical application 
      of AI to the field of HTx. METHOD: A systematic overview of studies published up 
      to December 31st, 2022, in English on peer-revied journals, have been identified 
      through PUBMED-MEDLINE-WEB of Science, referring to HTx, AI, BD. Studies were 
      grouped in 4 domains based on main studies' objectives and results: etiology, 
      diagnosis, prognosis, treatment. A systematic attempt was made to evaluate 
      studies by the Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST) and the 
      Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual 
      Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD). RESULTS: Among the 27 publications selected, 
      none used AI applied to BD. Of the selected studies, 4 fell in the domain of 
      etiology, 6 in the domain of diagnosis, 3 in the domain of treatment, and 17 in 
      that of prognosis, as AI was most frequently used for algorithmic prediction and 
      discrimination of survival, but in retrospective cohorts and registries. AI-based 
      algorithms appeared superior to probabilistic functions to predict patterns, but 
      external validation was rarely employed. Indeed, based on PROBAST, selected 
      studies showed, to some extent, significant risk of bias (especially in the 
      domain of predictors and analysis). In addition, as example of applicability in 
      the real-world, a free-use prediction algorithm developed through AI failed to 
      predict 1-year mortality post-HTx in cases from our center. CONCLUSIONS: While 
      AI-based prognostic and diagnostic functions performed better than those 
      developed by traditional statistics, risk of bias, lack of external validation, 
      and relatively poor applicability, may affect AI-based tools. More unbiased 
      research with high quality BD meant for AI, transparency and external 
      validations, are needed to have medical AI as a systematic aid to clinical 
      decision making in HTx.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The introduction of Artificial Intelligence into the 
      healthcare system offers enormous opportunities for biomedical research, the 
      improvement of patient care, and cost reduction in high-end medicine. Digital 
      concepts and workflows are already playing an increasingly important role in 
      cardiology. The fusion of computer science and medicine offers great 
      transformative potential and enables enormous acceleration processes in 
      cardiovascular medicine. RECENT FINDINGS: As medical data becomes smart, it is 
      also becoming more valuable and vulnerable to malicious actors. In addition, the 
      gap between what is technically possible and what is allowed by privacy 
      legislation is growing. Principles of the General Data Protection Regulation that 
      have been in force since May 2018, such as transparency, purpose limitation, and 
      data minimization, seem to hinder the development and use of Artificial 
      Intelligence. Concepts to secure data integrity and incorporate legal and ethical 
      principles can help to avoid the potential risks of digitization and may result 
      in an European leadership in regard to privacy protection and AI. The following 
      review provides an overview of relevant aspects of Artificial Intelligence and 
      Machine Learning, highlights selected applications in cardiology, and discusses 
      central ethical and legal considerations.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence in Medicine: Chances and Challenges for Wide Clinical 
      Adoption.
PG  - 443-449
LID - 10.1159/000511930 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) applications that utilize machine 
      learning are on the rise in clinical research and provide highly promising 
      applications in specific use cases. However, wide clinical adoption remains far 
      off. This review reflects on common barriers and current solution approaches. 
      SUMMARY: Key challenges are abbreviated as the RISE criteria: Regulatory aspects, 
      Interpretability, interoperability, and the need for Structured data and 
      Evidence. As reoccurring barriers of AI adoption, these concepts are delineated 
      and complemented by points to consider and possible solutions for effective and 
      safe use of AI applications. KEY MESSAGES: There is a fraction of AI applications 
      with proven clinical benefits and regulatory approval. Many new promising systems 
      are the subject of current research but share common issues for wide clinical 
      adoption. The RISE criteria can support preparation for challenges and pitfalls 
      when designing or introducing AI applications into clinical practice.

LID - e1451 [pii]
LID - 10.1002/widm.1451 [doi]
AB  - In recent years Artificial Intelligence in the form of machine learning has been 
      revolutionizing biology, biomedical sciences, and gene-based agricultural 
      technology capabilities. Massive data generated in biological sciences by rapid 
      and deep gene sequencing and protein or other molecular structure determination, 
      on the one hand, requires data analysis capabilities using machine learning that 
      are distinctly different from classical statistical methods; on the other, these 
      large datasets are enabling the adoption of novel data-intensive machine learning 
      algorithms for the solution of biological problems that until recently had relied 
      on mechanistic model-based approaches that are computationally expensive. This 
      review provides a bird's eye view of the applications of machine learning in 
      post-genomic biology. Attempt is also made to indicate as far as possible the 
      areas of research that are poised to make further impacts in these areas, 
      including the importance of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) in human 
      health. Further contributions of machine learning are expected to transform 
      medicine, public health, agricultural technology, as well as to provide 
      invaluable gene-based guidance for the management of complex environments in this 
      age of global warming.

TI  - Precision oncology: a review to assess interpretability in several explainable 
      methods.
LID - 10.1093/bib/bbad200 [doi]
LID - bbad200
AB  - Great efforts have been made to develop precision medicine-based treatments using 
      machine learning. In this field, where the goal is to provide the optimal 
      treatment for each patient based on his/her medical history and genomic 
      characteristics, it is not sufficient to make excellent predictions. The 
      challenge is to understand and trust the model's decisions while also being able 
      to easily implement it. However, one of the issues with machine learning 
      algorithms-particularly deep learning-is their lack of interpretability. This 
      review compares six different machine learning methods to provide guidance for 
      defining interpretability by focusing on accuracy, multi-omics capability, 
      explainability and implementability. Our selection of algorithms includes tree-, 
      regression- and kernel-based methods, which we selected for their ease of 
      interpretation for the clinician. We also included two novel explainable methods 
      in the comparison. No significant differences in accuracy were observed when 
      comparing the methods, but an improvement was observed when using gene expression 
      instead of mutational status as input for these methods. We concentrated on the 
      current intriguing challenge: model comprehension and ease of use. Our comparison 
      suggests that the tree-based methods are the most interpretable of those tested.

AB  - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease causing progressive joint 
      damage. Early diagnosis and treatment is critical, but remains challenging due to 
      RA complexity and heterogeneity. Machine learning (ML) techniques may enhance RA 
      management by identifying patterns within multidimensional biomedical data to 
      improve classification, diagnosis, and treatment predictions. In this review, we 
      summarize the applications of ML for RA management. Emerging studies or 
      applications have developed diagnostic and predictive models for RA that utilize 
      a variety of data modalities, including electronic health records, imaging, and 
      multi-omics data. High-performance supervised learning models have demonstrated 
      an Area Under the Curve (AUC) exceeding 0.85, which is used for identifying RA 
      patients and predicting treatment responses. Unsupervised learning has revealed 
      potential RA subtypes. Ongoing research is integrating multimodal data with deep 
      learning to further improve performance. However, key challenges remain regarding 
      model overfitting, generalizability, validation in clinical settings, and 
      interpretability. Small sample sizes and lack of diverse population testing risks 
      overestimating model performance. Prospective studies evaluating real-world 
      clinical utility are lacking. Enhancing model interpretability is critical for 
      clinician acceptance. In summary, while ML shows promise for transforming RA 
      management through earlier diagnosis and optimized treatment, larger scale 
      multisite data, prospective clinical validation of interpretable models, and 
      testing across diverse populations is still needed. As these gaps are addressed, 
      ML may pave the way towards precision medicine in RA.

AB  - Regenerative AI is transforming breast cancer diagnosis and treatment through 
      enhanced imaging analysis, personalized medicine, drug discovery, and remote 
      patient monitoring. AI algorithms can detect subtle patterns in mammograms and 
      other imaging modalities with high accuracy, potentially leading to earlier 
      diagnoses. In treatment planning, AI integrates patient-specific data to predict 
      individual responses and optimize therapies. For drug discovery, generative AI 
      models rapidly design and screen novel molecules targeting breast cancer 
      pathways. Remote monitoring tools powered by AI provide real-time insights to 
      guide care. Examples include Google's LYNA for analyzing pathology slides, 
      Kheiron's Mia for mammogram interpretation, and Tempus's platform for integrating 
      clinical and genomic data. While promising, challenges remain, including limited 
      high-quality training data, integration into clinical workflows, interpretability 
      of AI decisions, and regulatory/ethical concerns. Strategies to address these 
      include collaborative data-sharing initiatives, user-centered design, explainable 
      AI techniques, and robust oversight frameworks. In developing countries, AI tools 
      like MammoAssist and Niramai's thermal imaging system are improving access to 
      screening. Overall, regenerative AI offers significant potential to enhance 
      breast cancer care, but judicious implementation with awareness of limitations is 
      crucial. Coordinated efforts across the healthcare ecosystem are needed to fully 
      realize AI's benefits while addressing challenges.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) can unveil novel personalized treatments based on 
      drug screening and whole-exome sequencing experiments (WES). However, the concept 
      of "black box" in AI limits the potential of this approach to be translated into 
      the clinical practice. In contrast, explainable AI (XAI) focuses on making AI 
      results understandable to humans. Here, we present a novel XAI method -called 
      multi-dimensional module optimization (MOM)- that associates drug screening with 
      genetic events, while guaranteeing that predictions are interpretable and robust. 
      We applied MOM to an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cohort of 319 ex-vivo tumor 
      samples with 122 screened drugs and WES. MOM returned a therapeutic strategy 
      based on the FLT3, CBFβ-MYH11, and NRAS status, which predicted AML patient 
      response to Quizartinib, Trametinib, Selumetinib, and Crizotinib. We successfully 
      validated the results in three different large-scale screening experiments. We 
      believe that XAI will help healthcare providers and drug regulators better 
      understand AI medical decisions.

AB  - The clinical adenoma - carcinoma progression represents a well-established 
      framework for understanding colorectal cancer (CRC) development, although the 
      molecular mechanisms underlying this transition remain only partially understood. 
      Increasing evidence suggests the gut microbiome (GM) as a key modulator of 
      colorectal carcinogenesis, positioning microbial profiling as a promising avenue 
      for noninvasive risk stratification and early detection. In this study, Machine 
      Learning (ML) classifiers integrated with eXplainable Artificial Intelligence 
      (XAI) techniques were employed to identify microbiome-derived biomarkers 
      predictive of CRC and adenomatous lesions. The models were trained on 16S rRNA 
      sequencing data from 453 patients and evaluated through cross-validation, 
      achieving AU-ROC and AU-PRC scores of 0.71 and 0.67, respectively. External 
      validation on an independent Italian cohort (n = 43) yielded AU-ROC and AU-PRC 
      scores of 0.70 and 0.89, respectively. XAI-based interpretation revealed 
      consistent microbial signatures across datasets. In detail, taxa belonging to the 
      Fusobacterium and Peptostreptococcus genera were associated with increased CRC 
      risk, whereas the Eubacterium eligens group was identified as a robust negative 
      predictor. Beyond classification, patient-level explanations enabled by XAI 
      facilitated the identification of adenoma subgroups exhibiting microbiome 
      profiles converging toward those of CRC, suggesting the presence of transitional 
      microbial states. Moreover, SHAP-based interaction networks uncovered microbial 
      hubs and inter-species dependencies characterizing high-risk configurations, 
      providing insights into the ecological dynamics of colorectal tumorigenesis. 
      These findings demonstrate the added XAI value in elucidating microbiome 
      interactions, enhancing model interpretability, and supporting biologically 
      informed hypotheses. This integrative, explainable framework highlights the 
      potential of AI-driven microbiome analysis in precision oncology and advances the 
      development of interpretable, noninvasive tools for CRC risk prediction and 
      management.

AB  - The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into point-of-care testing (POCT) 
      represents a transformative leap in modern healthcare, addressing critical 
      challenges in diagnostic accuracy, workflow efficiency, and equitable access. 
      While POCT has revolutionized decentralized care through rapid results, its 
      potential is hindered by variability in accuracy, integration hurdles, and 
      resource constraints. AI technologies-encompassing machine learning, deep 
      learning, and natural language processing-offer robust solutions: convolutional 
      neural networks improve malaria detection in sub-Saharan Africa to 95 % 
      sensitivity, while predictive analytics reduce device downtime by 20 % in 
      resource-limited settings. AI-driven decision support systems curtail antibiotic 
      misuse by 40 % through real-time data synthesis, and portable AI devices enable 
      anaemia screening in rural India with 94 % accuracy, slashing diagnostic delays 
      from weeks to hours. Despite these advancements, challenges persist, including 
      data privacy risks, algorithmic opacity, and infrastructural gaps in low- and 
      middle-income countries. Explainable AI frameworks and blockchain encryption are 
      critical to building clinician trust and ensuring regulatory compliance. Future 
      directions emphasize the convergence of AI with Internet of Things (IoT) and 
      blockchain for predictive diagnostics, as demonstrated by AI-IoT systems 
      forecasting dengue outbreaks 14 days in advance. Personalized medicine, powered 
      by genomic and wearable data integration, further underscores AI potential to 
      tailor therapies, reducing cardiovascular events by 25 %. Realizing this vision 
      demands interdisciplinary collaboration, ethical governance, and equitable 
      implementation to bridge global health disparities. By harmonizing innovation 
      with accessibility, AI-enhanced POCT emerges as a cornerstone of proactive, 
      patient-centered healthcare, poised to democratize diagnostics and drive 
      sustainable health equity worldwide.

TI  - Discovering Themes in Deep Brain Stimulation Research Using Explainable 
      Artificial Intelligence.
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines11030771 [doi]
LID - 771
AB  - Deep brain stimulation is a treatment that controls symptoms by changing brain 
      activity. The complexity of how to best treat brain dysfunction with deep brain 
      stimulation has spawned research into artificial intelligence approaches. Machine 
      learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that uses computers to learn 
      patterns in data and has many healthcare applications, such as an aid in 
      diagnosis, personalized medicine, and clinical decision support. Yet, how machine 
      learning models make decisions is often opaque. The spirit of explainable 
      artificial intelligence is to use machine learning models that produce 
      interpretable solutions. Here, we use topic modeling to synthesize recent 
      literature on explainable artificial intelligence approaches to extracting domain 
      knowledge from machine learning models relevant to deep brain stimulation. The 
      results show that patient classification (i.e., diagnostic models, precision 
      medicine) is the most common problem in deep brain stimulation studies that 
      employ explainable artificial intelligence. Other topics concern attempts to 
      optimize stimulation strategies and the importance of explainable methods. 
      Overall, this review supports the potential for artificial intelligence to 
      revolutionize deep brain stimulation by personalizing stimulation protocols and 
      adapting stimulation in real time.

AB  - With the advancements in precision medicine, the demands on pathological 
      diagnostics have increased, requiring standardized, quantitative, and integrated 
      assessments of histomorphological and molecular pathological data. Great hopes 
      are placed in artificial intelligence (AI) methods, which have demonstrated the 
      ability to analyze complex clinical, histological, and molecular data for disease 
      classification, biomarker quantification, and prognosis estimation. This paper 
      provides an overview of the latest developments in pathology AI, discusses the 
      limitations, particularly concerning the black box character of AI, and describes 
      solutions to make decision processes more transparent using methods of so-called 
      explainable AI (XAI).

AB  - Clinical research and practice in the 21st century is poised to be transformed by 
      analysis of computable electronic medical records and population-level 
      genome-scale patient profiles. Genomic data capture genetic and environmental 
      state, providing information on heterogeneity in disease and treatment outcome, 
      but genomic-based clinical risk scores are limited. Achieving the goal of routine 
      precision medicine that takes advantage of these rich genomics data will require 
      computational methods that support heterogeneous data, have excellent predictive 
      performance, and ideally, provide biologically interpretable results. Traditional 
      machine-learning approaches excel at performance, but often have limited 
      interpretability. Patient similarity networks are an emerging paradigm for 
      precision medicine, in which patients are clustered or classified based on their 
      similarities in various features, including genomic profiles. This strategy is 
      analogous to standard medical diagnosis, has excellent performance, is 
      interpretable, and can preserve patient privacy. We review new methods based on 
      patient similarity networks, including Similarity Network Fusion for patient 
      clustering and netDx for patient classification. While these methods are already 
      useful, much work is required to improve their scalability for contemporary 
      genetic cohorts, optimize parameters, and incorporate a wide range of genomics 
      and clinical data. The coming 5 years will provide an opportunity to assess the 
      utility of network-based algorithms for precision medicine.

TI  - Explainable and visualizable machine learning models to predict biochemical 
      recurrence of prostate cancer.
PG  - 2369-2379
LID - 10.1007/s12094-024-03480-x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Machine learning (ML) models presented an excellent performance in the 
      prognosis prediction. However, the black box characteristic of ML models limited 
      the clinical applications. Here, we aimed to establish explainable and 
      visualizable ML models to predict biochemical recurrence (BCR) of prostate cancer 
      (PCa). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 647 PCa patients were retrospectively 
      evaluated. Clinical parameters were identified using LASSO regression. Then, 
      cohort was split into training and validation datasets with a ratio of 0.75:0.25 
      and BCR-related features were included in Cox regression and five ML algorithm to 
      construct BCR prediction models. The clinical utility of each model was evaluated 
      by concordance index (C-index) values and decision curve analyses (DCA). Besides, 
      Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) values were used to explain the features in 
      the models. RESULTS: We identified 11 BCR-related features using LASSO 
      regression, then establishing five ML-based models, including random survival 
      forest (RSF), survival support vector machine (SSVM), survival Tree (sTree), 
      gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and 
      a Cox regression model, C-index were 0.846 (95%CI 0.796-0.894), 0.774 (95%CI 
      0.712-0.834), 0.757 (95%CI 0.694-0.818), 0.820 (95%CI 0.765-0.869), 0.793 (95%CI 
      0.735-0.852), and 0.807 (95%CI 0.753-0.858), respectively. The DCA showed that 
      RSF model had significant advantages over all models. In interpretability of ML 
      models, the SHAP value demonstrated the tangible contribution of each feature in 
      RSF model. CONCLUSIONS: Our score system provide reference for the identification 
      for BCR, and the crafting of a framework for making therapeutic decisions for PCa 
      on a personalized basis.

LID - 10.1146/annurev-pathmechdis-051222-113147 [doi]
AB  - The rapid development of precision medicine in recent years has started to 
      challenge diagnostic pathology with respect to its ability to analyze 
      histological images and increasingly large molecular profiling data in a 
      quantitative, integrative, and standardized way. Artificial intelligence (AI) 
      and, more precisely, deep learning technologies have recently demonstrated the 
      potential to facilitate complex data analysis tasks, including clinical, 
      histological, and molecular data for disease classification; tissue biomarker 
      quantification; and clinical outcome prediction. This review provides a general 
      introduction to AI and describes recent developments with a focus on applications 
      in diagnostic pathology and beyond. We explain limitations including the 
      black-box character of conventional AI and describe solutions to make machine 
      learning decisions more transparent with so-called explainable AI. The purpose of 
      the review is to foster a mutual understanding of both the biomedical and the AI 
      side. To that end, in addition to providing an overview of the relevant 
      foundations in pathology and machine learning, we present worked-through examples 
      for a better practical understanding of what AI can achieve and how it should be 
      done.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence and Advanced Technology in Glaucoma: A Review.
LID - 10.3390/jpm14101062 [doi]
LID - 1062
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, 
      necessitating precise management strategies tailored to individual patient 
      characteristics. Artificial intelligence (AI) holds promise in revolutionizing 
      the approach to glaucoma care by providing personalized interventions. AIM: This 
      review explores the current landscape of AI applications in the personalized 
      management of glaucoma patients, highlighting advancements, challenges, and 
      future directions. METHODS: A systematic search of electronic databases, 
      including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, was conducted to identify relevant 
      studies published up to 2024. Studies exploring the use of AI techniques in 
      personalized management strategies for glaucoma patients were included. RESULTS: 
      The review identified diverse AI applications in glaucoma management, ranging 
      from early detection and diagnosis to treatment optimization and prognosis 
      prediction. Machine learning algorithms, particularly deep learning models, 
      demonstrated high accuracy in diagnosing glaucoma from various imaging modalities 
      such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) and visual field tests. AI-driven risk 
      stratification tools facilitated personalized treatment decisions by integrating 
      patient-specific data with predictive analytics, enhancing therapeutic outcomes 
      while minimizing adverse effects. Moreover, AI-based teleophthalmology platforms 
      enabled remote monitoring and timely intervention, improving patient access to 
      specialized care. CONCLUSIONS: Integrating AI technologies in the personalized 
      management of glaucoma patients holds immense potential for optimizing clinical 
      decision-making, enhancing treatment efficacy, and mitigating disease 
      progression. However, challenges such as data heterogeneity, model 
      interpretability, and regulatory concerns warrant further investigation. Future 
      research should focus on refining AI algorithms, validating their clinical 
      utility through large-scale prospective studies, and ensuring seamless 
      integration into routine clinical practice to realize the full benefits of 
      personalized glaucoma care.

      Strategies.
PG  - 3753-3766
LID - 10.2147/OPTH.S495307 [doi]
AB  - In the dynamic field of ophthalmology, artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging 
      as a transformative tool in managing complex conditions like uveitis. 
      Characterized by diverse inflammatory responses, uveitis presents significant 
      diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. This systematic review explores the role 
      of AI in advancing diagnostic precision, optimizing therapeutic approaches, and 
      improving patient outcomes in uveitis care. A comprehensive search of PubMed, 
      Scopus, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Embase identified over 10,000 
      articles using primary and secondary keywords related to AI and uveitis. Rigorous 
      screening based on predefined criteria reduced the pool to 52 high-quality 
      studies, categorized into six themes: diagnostic support algorithms, screening 
      algorithms, standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN), AI applications in 
      management, systemic implications of AI, and limitations with future directions. 
      AI technologies, including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), 
      demonstrated proficiency in anterior chamber inflammation detection, vitreous 
      haze grading, and screening for conditions like ocular toxoplasmosis. Despite 
      these advancements, challenges such as dataset quality, algorithmic transparency, 
      and ethical concerns persist. Future research should focus on developing robust, 
      multimodal AI systems and fostering collaboration among academia and industry to 
      ensure equitable, ethical, and effective AI applications. The integration of AI 
      heralds a new era in uveitis management, emphasizing precision medicine and 
      enhanced care delivery.

AB  - The editorial, "Clinical and translational mode of single-cell measurements: An 
      artificial intelligent single-cell," introduces the innovative clinical 
      artificial intelligence single-cell (caiSC) system, which merges AI with 
      single-cell informatics to advance real-time diagnostics, disease monitoring, and 
      treatment prediction. By combining clinical data and multimodal molecular inputs, 
      caiSC facilitates personalized medicine, promising enhanced diagnostic precision 
      and tailored therapeutic approaches. Despite its potential, caiSC lacks 
      comprehensive data coverage across cell types and diseases, presenting challenges 
      in data quality and model robustness. The article explores development strategies 
      such as data expansion, machine learning advancements, and interpretability 
      improvements. Future applications of caiSC could include digital cell twins, 
      offering in-depth simulations of cellular behavior to support drug discovery and 
      personalized treatments. Regulatory considerations are discussed, underscoring 
      the need for SaMD/AIaMD certifications for clinical use. Ultimately, with further 
      refinement, caiSC could transform clinical decision-making, driving personalized, 
      precision medicine, and improved patient outcomes. KEY POINTS: Integration of AI 
      with Single-Cell Informatics for Precision Medicine: The caiSC system combines 
      artificial intelligence and single-cell data to improve diagnostics, treatment 
      predictions, and personalized medical decision-making. Challenges in Data 
      Coverage and Model Robustness: caiSC currently faces limitations due to 
      incomplete data across cell types, diseases, and organs, as well as challenges in 
      data quality and high computational demands, which affect model accuracy and 
      clinical applicability. Future Potential and Regulatory Needs: The caiSC 
      framework's development could lead to innovations such as digital cell twins, 
      enabling personalized simulations of cellular responses for better treatment 
      planning, though regulatory certification is essential for safe clinical use.

TI  - Machine learning in oncological pharmacogenomics: advancing personalized 
      chemotherapy.
PG  - 182
LID - 10.1007/s10142-024-01462-4 [doi]
AB  - This review analyzes the application of machine learning (ML) in oncological 
      pharmacogenomics, focusing on customizing chemotherapy treatments. It explores 
      how ML can analyze extensive genomic, proteomic, and other omics datasets to 
      identify genetic patterns associated with drug responses. This, in turn, 
      facilitates personalized therapies that are more effective and have fewer side 
      effects. Recent studies have emphasized ML's revolutionary role of ML in 
      personalized oncology treatment by identifying genetic variability and 
      understanding cancer pharmacodynamics. Integrating ML with electronic health 
      records and clinical data shows promise in refining chemotherapy recommendations 
      by considering the complex influencing factors. Although standard chemotherapy 
      depends on population-based doses and treatment regimens, customized techniques 
      use genetic information to tailor treatments for specific patients, potentially 
      enhancing efficacy and reducing adverse effects.However, challenges, such as 
      model interpretability, data quality, transparency, ethical issues related to 
      data privacy, and health disparities, remain. Machine learning has been used to 
      transform oncological pharmacogenomics by enabling personalized chemotherapy 
      treatments. This review highlights ML's potential of ML to enhance treatment 
      effectiveness and minimize side effects through detailed genetic analysis. It 
      also addresses ongoing challenges including improved model interpretability, data 
      quality, and ethical considerations. The review concludes by emphasizing the 
      importance of rigorous clinical trials and interdisciplinary collaboration in the 
      ethical implementation of ML-driven personalized medicine, paving the way for 
      improved outcomes in cancer patients and marking a new frontier in cancer 
      treatment.

TI  - MOSAIC: An Artificial Intelligence-Based Framework for Multimodal Analysis, 
      Classification, and Personalized Prognostic Assessment in Rare Cancers.
PG  - e2400008
LID - 10.1200/CCI.24.00008 [doi]
LID - e2400008
AB  - PURPOSE: Rare cancers constitute over 20% of human neoplasms, often affecting 
      patients with unmet medical needs. The development of effective classification 
      and prognostication systems is crucial to improve the decision-making process and 
      drive innovative treatment strategies. We have created and implemented MOSAIC, an 
      artificial intelligence (AI)-based framework designed for multimodal analysis, 
      classification, and personalized prognostic assessment in rare cancers. Clinical 
      validation was performed on myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a rare hematologic 
      cancer with clinical and genomic heterogeneities. METHODS: We analyzed 4,427 
      patients with MDS divided into training and validation cohorts. Deep learning 
      methods were applied to integrate and impute clinical/genomic features. 
      Clustering was performed by combining Uniform Manifold Approximation and 
      Projection for Dimension Reduction + Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial 
      Clustering of Applications with Noise (UMAP + HDBSCAN) methods, compared with the 
      conventional Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP). Linear and AI-based nonlinear 
      approaches were compared for survival prediction. Explainable AI (Shapley 
      Additive Explanations approach [SHAP]) and federated learning were used to 
      improve the interpretation and the performance of the clinical models, 
      integrating them into distributed infrastructure. RESULTS: UMAP + HDBSCAN 
      clustering obtained a more granular patient stratification, achieving a higher 
      average silhouette coefficient (0.16) with respect to HDP (0.01) and higher 
      balanced accuracy in cluster classification by Random Forest (92.7% ± 1.3% and 
      85.8% ± 0.8%). AI methods for survival prediction outperform conventional 
      statistical techniques and the reference prognostic tool for MDS. Nonlinear 
      Gradient Boosting Survival stands in the internal (Concordance-Index [C-Index], 
      0.77; SD, 0.01) and external validation (C-Index, 0.74; SD, 0.02). SHAP analysis 
      revealed that similar features drove patients' subgroups and outcomes in both 
      training and validation cohorts. Federated implementation improved the accuracy 
      of developed models. CONCLUSION: MOSAIC provides an explainable and robust

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are transforming 
      nephrology by enhancing diagnosis, risk prediction, and treatment optimization 
      for conditions such as acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD). AI-driven models utilize diverse datasets-including electronic health 
      records, imaging, and biomarkers-to improve clinical decision-making. 
      Applications such as convolutional neural networks for kidney biopsy 
      interpretation, and predictive modeling for renal replacement therapies 
      underscore AI's potential. Nonetheless, challenges including data quality, 
      limited external validation, algorithmic bias, and poor interpretability 
      constrain the clinical reliability of AI/ML models. To address these issues, this 
      article offers a structured framework for nephrologist peer reviewers, 
      integrating the TRIPOD-AI (Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction 
      Model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis-AI Extension) checklist. Key 
      evaluation criteria include dataset integrity, feature selection, model 
      validation, reporting transparency, ethics, and real-world applicability. This 
      framework promotes rigorous peer review and enhances the reproducibility, 
      clinical relevance, and fairness of AI research in nephrology. Moreover, AI/ML 
      studies must confront biases-data, selection, and algorithmic-that adversely 
      affect model performance. Mitigation strategies such as data diversification, 
      multi-center validation, and fairness-aware algorithms are essential. Overfitting 
      in AI is driven by small patient cohorts faced with thousands of candidate 
      features; our framework spotlights this imbalance and offers concrete remedies. 
      Future directions in AI-driven nephrology include multimodal data fusion for 
      improved predictive modeling, deep learning for automated imaging analysis, 
      wearable-based monitoring, and clinical decision support systems (CDSS) that 
      integrate comprehensive patient data. A visual summary of key manuscript sections 
      is included.

AB  - Multiomics data including imaging radiomics and various types of molecular 
      biomarkers have been increasingly investigated for better diagnosis and therapy 
      in the era of precision oncology. Artificial intelligence (AI) including machine 
      learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques combined with the exponential 
      growth of multiomics data may have great potential to revolutionize cancer 
      subtyping, risk stratification, prognostication, prediction and clinical 
      decision-making. In this article, we first present different categories of 
      multiomics data and their roles in diagnosis and therapy. Second, AI-based data 
      fusion methods and modeling methods as well as different validation schemes are 
      illustrated. Third, the applications and examples of multiomics research in 
      oncology are demonstrated. Finally, the challenges regarding the heterogeneity 
      data set, availability of omics data, and validation of the research are 
      discussed. The transition of multiomics research to real clinics still requires 
      consistent efforts in standardizing omics data collection and analysis, building 
      computational infrastructure for data sharing and storing, developing advanced 
      methods to improve data fusion and interpretability, and ultimately, conducting 
      large-scale prospective clinical trials to fill the gap between study findings 
      and clinical benefits.

TI  - Machine learning in cardiovascular risk assessment: Towards a precision medicine 
      approach.
PG  - e70017
LID - 10.1111/eci.70017 [doi]
AB  - Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of global morbidity and 
      mortality. Validated risk scores are the basis of guideline-recommended care, but 
      most scores lack the capacity to integrate complex and multidimensional data. 
      Limitations inherent to traditional risk prediction models and the growing burden 
      of residual cardiovascular risk highlight the need for refined strategies that go 
      beyond conventional paradigms. Artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) 
      provide unique opportunities to refine cardiovascular risk assessment and 
      surveillance through the integration of diverse data types and sources, including 
      clinical, electrocardiographic, imaging and multi-omics derived data. In fact, ML 
      models, such as deep neural networks, can handle high-dimensional data through 
      which phenotyping and cardiovascular risk assessment across diverse patient 
      populations become much more precise, fostering a paradigm shift towards more 
      personalized care. Here, we review the role of ML in advancing cardiovascular 
      risk assessment and discuss its potential to identify novel therapeutic targets 
      and to improve prevention strategies. We also discuss key challenges inherent to 
      ML, such as data quality, standardized reporting, model transparency and 
      validation, and discuss barriers in its clinical translation. We highlight the 
      transformative potential of ML in precision cardiology and advocate for more 
      personalized cardiovascular prevention strategies that go beyond previous 
      notions.

AB  - With the progress of medical technology, biomedical field ushered in the era of 
      big data, based on which and driven by artificial intelligence technology, 
      computational medicine has emerged. People need to extract the effective 
      information contained in these big biomedical data to promote the development of 
      precision medicine. Traditionally, the machine learning methods are used to dig 
      out biomedical data to find the features from data, which generally rely on 
      feature engineering and domain knowledge of experts, requiring tremendous time 
      and human resources. Different from traditional approaches, deep learning, as a 
      cutting-edge machine learning branch, can automatically learn complex and robust 
      feature from raw data without the need for feature engineering. The applications 
      of deep learning in medical image, electronic health record, genomics, and drug 
      development are studied, where the suggestion is that deep learning has obvious 
      advantage in making full use of biomedical data and improving medical health 
      level. Deep learning plays an increasingly important role in the field of medical 
      health and has a broad prospect of application. However, the problems and 
      challenges of deep learning in computational medical health still exist, 
      including insufficient data, interpretability, data privacy, and heterogeneity. 
      Analysis and discussion on these problems provide a reference to improve the 
      application of deep learning in medical health.

AB  - The field of omics, driven by advances in high-throughput sequencing, faces a 
      data explosion. This abundance of data offers unprecedented opportunities for 
      predictive modeling in precision medicine, but also presents formidable 
      challenges in data analysis and interpretation. Traditional machine learning (ML) 
      techniques have been partly successful in generating predictive models for omics 
      analysis but exhibit limitations in handling potential relationships within the 
      data for more accurate prediction. This review explores a revolutionary shift in 
      predictive modeling through the application of deep learning (DL), specifically 
      convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Using transformation methods such as 
      DeepInsight, omics data with independent variables in tabular (table-like, 
      including vector) form can be turned into image-like representations, enabling 
      CNNs to capture latent features effectively. This approach not only enhances 
      predictive power but also leverages transfer learning, reducing computational 
      time, and improving performance. However, integrating CNNs in predictive omics 
      data analysis is not without challenges, including issues related to model 
      interpretability, data heterogeneity, and data size. Addressing these challenges 
      requires a multidisciplinary approach, involving collaborations between ML 
      experts, bioinformatics researchers, biologists, and medical doctors. This review 
      illuminates these complexities and charts a course for future research to unlock 
      the full predictive potential of CNNs in omics data analysis and related fields.

TI  - Artificial intelligence-driven translational medicine: a machine learning 
      framework for predicting disease outcomes and optimizing patient-centric care.
PG  - 302

AB  - BACKGROUND: Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning 
      (ML) have revolutionized the medical field and transformed translational 
      medicine. These technologies enable more accurate disease trajectory models while 
      enhancing patient-centered care. However, challenges such as heterogeneous 
      datasets, class imbalance, and scalability remain barriers to achieving optimal 
      predictive performance. METHODS: This study proposes a novel AI-based framework 
      that integrates Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) 
      to address these challenges. The framework was evaluated using two distinct 
      datasets: MIMIC-IV, a critical care database containing clinical data of 
      critically ill patients, and the UK Biobank, which comprises genetic, clinical, 
      and lifestyle data from 500,000 participants. Key performance metrics, including 
      Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUROC, were used to assess the 
      framework against traditional and advanced ML models. RESULTS: The proposed 
      framework demonstrated superior performance compared to classical models such as 
      Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural 
      Networks. For example, on the UK Biobank dataset, the model achieved an AUROC of 
      0.96, significantly outperforming Neural Networks (0.92). The framework was also 
      efficient, requiring only 32.4 s for training on MIMIC-IV, with low prediction 
      latency, making it suitable for real-time applications. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed 
      AI-based framework effectively addresses critical challenges in translational 
      medicine, offering superior predictive accuracy and efficiency. Its robust 
      performance across diverse datasets highlights its potential for integration into 
      real-time clinical decision support systems, facilitating personalized medicine 
      and improving patient outcomes. Future research will focus on enhancing 
      scalability and interpretability for broader clinical applications.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence-Driven Radiomics in Head and Neck Cancer: Current Status 
      and Future Prospects.
PG  - 105464
LID - S1386-5056(24)00127-8 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2024.105464 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Radiomics is a rapidly growing field used to leverage medical 
      radiological images by extracting quantitative features. These are supposed to 
      characterize a patient's phenotype, and when combined with artificial 
      intelligence techniques, to improve the accuracy of diagnostic models and 
      clinical outcome prediction. OBJECTIVES: This review aims at examining the 
      application areas of artificial intelligence-based radiomics (AI-based radiomics) 
      for the management of head and neck cancer (HNC). It further explores the 
      workflow of AI-based radiomics for personalized and precision oncology in HNC. 
      Finally, it examines the current challenges of AI-based radiomics in daily 
      clinical oncology and offers possible solutions to these challenges. METHODS: 
      Comprehensive electronic databases (PubMed, Medline via Ovid, Scopus, Web of 
      Science, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library) were searched following the Preferred 
      Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. The 
      quality of included studies and their risk of biases were evaluated using the 
      Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual 
      Prognosis or Diagnosis (TRIPOD)and Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool 
      (PROBAST). RESULTS: Out of the 659 search hits retrieved, 45 fulfilled the 
      inclusion criteria. Our review revealed that the application of AI-based 
      radiomics model as an ancillary tool for improved decision-making in HNC 
      management includes radiomics-based cancer diagnosis and radiomics-based cancer 
      prognosis. The radiomics-based cancer diagnosis includes tumor staging, tumor 
      grading, and classification of malignant and benign tumors. Similarly, 
      radiomics-based cancer prognosis includes prediction for treatment response, 
      recurrence, metastasis, and survival. In addition, the challenges in the 
      implementation of these models for clinical evaluations include data imbalance, 
      feature engineering (extraction and selection), model generalizability, 
      multi-modal fusion, and model interpretability. CONCLUSION: Considering the 
      highly subjective and interobserver variability that is peculiar to the 
      interpretation of medical images by expert clinicians, AI-based radiomics seeks 
      to offer potentially useful quantitative information, which is not visible to the 
      human eye or unintentionally often remain ignored during clinical imaging 
      practice. By enabling the extraction of this type of information, AI-based 
      radiomics has the potential to revolutionize HNC oncology, providing a platform 
      for more personalized, higher quality, and cost-effective care for HNC patients.

TI  - Machine Learning and Explainable Artificial Intelligence Using Counterfactual 
      Explanations for Evaluating Posture Parameters.
LID - 10.3390/bioengineering10050511 [doi]
LID - 511
AB  - Postural deficits such as hyperlordosis (hollow back) or hyperkyphosis 
      (hunchback) are relevant health issues. Diagnoses depend on the experience of the 
      examiner and are, therefore, often subjective and prone to errors. Machine 
      learning (ML) methods in combination with explainable artificial intelligence 
      (XAI) tools have proven useful for providing an objective, data-based 
      orientation. However, only a few works have considered posture parameters, 
      leaving the potential for more human-friendly XAI interpretations still 
      untouched. Therefore, the present work proposes an objective, data-driven ML 
      system for medical decision support that enables especially human-friendly 
      interpretations using counterfactual explanations (CFs). The posture data for 
      1151 subjects were recorded by means of stereophotogrammetry. An expert-based 
      classification of the subjects regarding the presence of hyperlordosis or 
      hyperkyphosis was initially performed. Using a Gaussian progress classifier, the 
      models were trained and interpreted using CFs. The label errors were flagged and 
      re-evaluated using confident learning. Very good classification performances for 
      both hyperlordosis and hyperkyphosis were found, whereby the re-evaluation and 
      correction of the test labels led to a significant improvement (M(PRAUC) = 0.97). 
      A statistical evaluation showed that the CFs seemed to be plausible, in general. 
      In the context of personalized medicine, the present study's approach could be of 
      importance for reducing diagnostic errors and thereby improving the individual 
      adaptation of therapeutic measures. Likewise, it could be a basis for the 
      development of apps for preventive posture assessment.

TI  - Artificial intelligence-driven radiomics study in cancer: the role of feature 
      engineering and modeling.

AB  - Modern medicine is reliant on various medical imaging technologies for 
      non-invasively observing patients' anatomy. However, the interpretation of 
      medical images can be highly subjective and dependent on the expertise of 
      clinicians. Moreover, some potentially useful quantitative information in medical 
      images, especially that which is not visible to the naked eye, is often ignored 
      during clinical practice. In contrast, radiomics performs high-throughput feature 
      extraction from medical images, which enables quantitative analysis of medical 
      images and prediction of various clinical endpoints. Studies have reported that 
      radiomics exhibits promising performance in diagnosis and predicting treatment 
      responses and prognosis, demonstrating its potential to be a non-invasive 
      auxiliary tool for personalized medicine. However, radiomics remains in a 
      developmental phase as numerous technical challenges have yet to be solved, 
      especially in feature engineering and statistical modeling. In this review, we 
      introduce the current utility of radiomics by summarizing research on its 
      application in the diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of treatment responses in 
      patients with cancer. We focus on machine learning approaches, for feature 
      extraction and selection during feature engineering and for imbalanced datasets 
      and multi-modality fusion during statistical modeling. Furthermore, we introduce 
      the stability, reproducibility, and interpretability of features, and the 
      generalizability and interpretability of models. Finally, we offer possible 
      solutions to current challenges in radiomics research.

TI  - Optimization of diagnosis and treatment of hematological diseases via artificial 
      intelligence.
PG  - 1487234
LID - 10.3389/fmed.2024.1487234 [doi]
LID - 1487234
AB  - BACKGROUND: Optimizing the diagnosis and treatment of hematological diseases is a 
      challenging yet crucial research area. Effective treatment plans typically 
      require the comprehensive integration of cell morphology, immunology, 
      cytogenetics, and molecular biology. These plans also consider patient-specific 
      factors such as disease stage, age, and genetic mutation status. With the 
      advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), more "AI + medical" application 
      models are emerging. In clinical practice, many AI-assisted systems have been 
      successfully applied to the diagnosis and treatment of hematological diseases, 
      enhancing precision and efficiency and offering valuable solutions for clinical 
      practice. OBJECTIVE: This study summarizes the research progress of various 
      AI-assisted systems applied in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of 
      hematological diseases, with a focus on their application in morphology, 
      immunology, cytogenetics, and molecular biology diagnosis, as well as prognosis 
      prediction and treatment. METHODS: Using PubMed, Web of Science, and other 
      network search engines, we conducted a literature search on studies from the past 
      5 years using the main keywords "artificial intelligence" and "hematological 
      diseases." We classified the clinical applications of AI systems according to the 
      diagnosis and treatment. We outline and summarize the current advancements in AI 
      for optimizing the diagnosis and treatment of hematological diseases, as well as 
      the difficulties and challenges in promoting the standardization of clinical 
      diagnosis and treatment in this field. RESULTS: AI can significantly shorten 
      turnaround times, reduce diagnostic costs, and accurately predict disease 
      outcomes through applications in image-recognition technology, genomic data 
      analysis, data mining, pattern recognition, and personalized medicine. However, 
      several challenges remain, including the lack of AI product standards, 
      standardized data, medical-industrial collaboration, and the complexity and 
      non-interpretability of AI systems. In addition, regulatory gaps can lead to data 
      privacy issues. Therefore, more research and improvements are needed to fully 
      leverage the potential of AI to promote standardization of the clinical diagnosis 
      and treatment of hematological diseases. CONCLUSION: Our results serve as a 
      reference point for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of hematological 
      diseases and the development of AI-assisted clinical diagnosis and treatment 
      systems. We offer suggestions for further development of AI in hematology and 
      standardization of clinical diagnosis and treatment.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly evolved and demonstrated its potential 
      in transforming biomedical cancer research, offering innovative solutions for 
      cancer diagnosis, treatment, and overall patient care. Over the past two decades, 
      AI has played a pivotal role in revolutionizing various facets of cancer clinical 
      research. In this comprehensive review, we delve into the diverse applications of 
      AI across the cancer care continuum, encompassing radiodiagnosis, radiotherapy, 
      chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, surgery, and nanotechnology. AI 
      has revolutionized cancer diagnosis, enabling early detection and precise 
      characterization through advanced image analysis techniques. In radiodiagnosis, 
      AI-driven algorithms enhance the accuracy of medical imaging, making it an 
      invaluable tool for clinicians in the detection and assessment of cancer. AI has 
      also revolutionized radiotherapy, facilitating precise tumor boundary 
      delineation, optimizing treatment planning, and enabling real-time adjustments to 
      improve therapeutic outcomes while minimizing collateral damage to healthy 
      tissues. In chemotherapy, AI models have emerged as powerful tools for predicting 
      patient responses to different treatment regimens, allowing for more personalized 
      and effective strategies. In immunotherapy, AI analyzes genetic and imaging data 
      to select ideal candidates for treatment and predict responses. Targeted therapy 
      has seen great advancements with AI, aiding in the identification of specific 
      molecular targets for tailored treatments. AI plays a vital role in surgery by 
      offering real-time navigation and support, enhancing surgical precision. 
      Moreover, the synergy between AI and nanotechnology promises the development of 
      personalized nanomedicines, offering more efficient and targeted cancer 
      treatments. While challenges related to data quality, interpretability, and 
      ethical considerations persist, the future of AI in cancer research holds 
      tremendous promise for improving patient outcomes through advanced and 
      individualized care.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Disease comorbidity is a major challenge in healthcare affecting the 
      patient's quality of life and costs. AI-based prediction of comorbidities can 
      overcome this issue by improving precision medicine and providing holistic care. 
      The objective of this systematic literature review was to identify and summarise 
      existing machine learning (ML) methods for comorbidity prediction and evaluate 
      the interpretability and explainability of the models. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 
      Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 
      framework was used to identify articles in three databases: Ovid Medline, Web of 
      Science and PubMed. The literature search covered a broad range of terms for the 
      prediction of disease comorbidity and ML, including traditional predictive 
      modelling. RESULTS: Of 829 unique articles, 58 full-text papers were assessed for 
      eligibility. A final set of 22 articles with 61 ML models was included in this 
      review. Of the identified ML models, 33 models achieved relatively high accuracy 
      (80-95%) and AUC (0.80-0.89). Overall, 72% of studies had high or unclear 
      concerns regarding the risk of bias. DISCUSSION: This systematic review is the 
      first to examine the use of ML and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) 
      methods for comorbidity prediction. The chosen studies focused on a limited scope 
      of comorbidities ranging from 1 to 34 (mean = 6), and no novel comorbidities were 
      found due to limited phenotypic and genetic data. The lack of standard evaluation 
      for XAI hinders fair comparisons. CONCLUSION: A broad range of ML methods has 
      been used to predict the comorbidities of various disorders. With further 
      development of explainable ML capacity in the field of comorbidity prediction, 
      there is a significant possibility of identifying unmet health needs by 
      highlighting comorbidities in patient groups that were not previously recognised 
      to be at risk for particular comorbidities.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming the landscape of critical 
      care, offering opportunities for enhanced diagnostic precision and personalized 
      patient management. However, its integration into ICU clinical practice presents 
      significant challenges related to equity, transparency, and the patient-clinician 
      relationship. To address these concerns, a multidisciplinary team of experts was 
      established to assess the current state and future trajectory of AI in critical 
      care. This consensus identified key challenges and proposed actionable 
      recommendations to guide AI implementation in this high-stakes field. Here we 
      present a call to action for the critical care community, to bridge the gap 
      between AI advancements and the need for humanized, patient-centred care. Our 
      goal is to ensure a smooth transition to personalized medicine while, (1) 
      maintaining equitable and unbiased decision-making, (2) fostering the development 
      of a collaborative research network across ICUs, emergency departments, and 
      operating rooms to promote data sharing and harmonization, and (3) addressing the 
      necessary educational and regulatory shifts required for responsible AI 
      deployment. AI integration into critical care demands coordinated efforts among 
      clinicians, patients, industry leaders, and regulators to ensure patient safety 
      and maximize societal benefit. The recommendations outlined here provide a 
      foundation for the ethical and effective implementation of AI in critical care 
      medicine.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a useful aid in numerous clinical 
      applications for diagnosis and treatment decisions. Deep neural networks have 
      shown the same or better performance than clinicians in many tasks owing to the 
      rapid increase in the available data and computational power. In order to conform 
      to the principles of trustworthy AI, it is essential that the AI system be 
      transparent, robust, fair, and ensure accountability. Current deep neural 
      solutions are referred to as black-boxes due to a lack of understanding of the 
      specifics concerning the decision-making process. Therefore, there is a need to 
      ensure the interpretability of deep neural networks before they can be 
      incorporated into the routine clinical workflow. In this narrative review, we 
      utilized systematic keyword searches and domain expertise to identify nine 
      different types of interpretability methods that have been used for understanding 
      deep learning models for medical image analysis applications based on the type of 
      generated explanations and technical similarities. Furthermore, we report the 
      progress made towards evaluating the explanations produced by various 
      interpretability methods. Finally, we discuss limitations, provide guidelines for 
      using interpretability methods and future directions concerning the 
      interpretability of deep neural networks for medical imaging analysis.

TI  - Can artificial intelligence overtake human intelligence on the bumpy road towards 
      glioma therapy?
PG  - 53

AB  - Gliomas are one of the most devastating primary brain tumors which impose 
      significant management challenges to the clinicians. The aggressive behaviour of 
      gliomas is mainly attributed to their rapid proliferation, unravelled genomics 
      and the blood-brain barrier which protects the tumor cells from chemotherapeutic 
      regimens. Suspects of brain tumors are usually assessed by magnetic resonance 
      imaging and computed tomography. These images allow surgeons to decide on the 
      tumor grading, intra-operative pathology, feasibility of surgery, and treatment 
      planning. All these data are compiled manually by physicians, wherein it takes 
      time for the validation of results and concluding the treatment modality. In this 
      context, the arrival of artificial intelligence in this era of personalized 
      medicine, has proven promising performance in the diagnosis and management of 
      gliomas. Starting from grading prediction till outcome evaluation, artificial 
      intelligence-based forefronts have revolutionized oncological research. 
      Interestingly, this approach has also been able to precisely differentiate tumor 
      lesion from healthy tissues. However, till date, their utility in 
      neuro-oncological field remains limited due to the issues pertaining to their 
      reliability and transparency. Hence, to shed novel insights on the "clinical 
      utility of this novel approach on glioma management" and to reveal "the 
      black-boxes that have to be solved for fruitful application of artificial 
      intelligence in neuro-oncology research", we provide in this review, a succinct 
      description of the potential gear of artificial intelligence-based avenues in 
      glioma treatment and the barriers that impede their rapid implementation in 
      neuro-oncology.

AB  - In the field of cancer genomics, the broad availability of genetic information 
      offered by next-generation sequencing technologies and rapid growth in biomedical 
      publication has led to the advent of the big-data era. Integration of artificial 
      intelligence (AI) approaches such as machine learning, deep learning, and natural 
      language processing (NLP) to tackle the challenges of scalability and high 
      dimensionality of data and to transform big data into clinically actionable 
      knowledge is expanding and becoming the foundation of precision medicine. In this 
      paper, we review the current status and future directions of AI application in 
      cancer genomics within the context of workflows to integrate genomic analysis for 
      precision cancer care. The existing solutions of AI and their limitations in 
      cancer genetic testing and diagnostics such as variant calling and interpretation 
      are critically analyzed. Publicly available tools or algorithms for key NLP 
      technologies in the literature mining for evidence-based clinical recommendations 
      are reviewed and compared. In addition, the present paper highlights the 
      challenges to AI adoption in digital healthcare with regard to data requirements, 
      algorithmic transparency, reproducibility, and real-world assessment, and 
      discusses the importance of preparing patients and physicians for modern 
      digitized healthcare. We believe that AI will remain the main driver to 
      healthcare transformation toward precision medicine, yet the unprecedented 
      challenges posed should be addressed to ensure safety and beneficial impact to 
      healthcare.

TI  - Development of machine learning model for predicting prolonged operation time in 
      lumbar stenosis undergoing posterior lumbar interbody fusion: a multicenter 
      study.

AB  - BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Longer posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) surgeries for 
      individuals with lumbar spinal stenosis are linked to more complications and 
      negatively affect recovery after the operation. Therefore, there is a critical 
      need for a method to accurately predict patients who are at risk for prolonged 
      operation times. PURPOSE: This research aimed to develop a clinical model to 
      predict prolonged operation time for patients undergoing PLIF procedures. STUDY 
      DESIGN/SETTING: This study employs a machine-learning approach to analyze data 
      retrospectively collected. PATIENT SAMPLE: About 3,233 patients diagnosed with 
      lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) had posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) at 22 
      hospitals in China from January 2015 to December 2022. OUTCOME MEASURES: The 
      primary outcome was operation time. Prolonged operation time defined as exceeded 
      75% of the overall surgical duration, which mean exceeding 240 minutes. METHODS: 
      A total of 3,233 patients who underwent PLIF surgery with lumbar spinal stenosis 
      (LSS) were divided into one training group and four test groups based on 
      different district areas. The training group included 1,569 patients, while Test1 
      had 541, Test2 had 403, Test3 had 351, and Test4 had 369 patients. Variables 
      consisted of demographics, perioperative details, preoperative laboratory 
      examinations and other Additional factors. Six algorithms were employed for 
      variable screening, and variables identified by more than two screening methods 
      were incorporated into the final model. In the training cohort, a 10-fold 
      cross-validation (CV) and Bayesian hyperparameter optimization techniques were 
      utilized to construct a model using eleven machine learning algorithms. Following 
      this, the model was evaluated using four separate external test sets, and the 
      mean Area Under the Curve (AUC) was computed to determine the best-performing 
      model. Further performance metrics of the best model were evaluated, and SHapley 
      Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were used for interpretability analysis to enhance 
      decision-making transparency. Ultimately, an online calculator was created. 
      RESULTS: Among the various machine learning models, the Random Forest achieved 
      the highest performance in the validation set, with AUROC scores of 0.832 in 
      Test1, 0.834 in Test2, 0.816 inTest3, 0.822 in Test4) compared with other machine 
      learning models. The top contributing variables were number of levels fusion, 
      pre-APTT, weight and age. The predictive model was further refined by developing 
      a web-based calculator for clinical application 
      (https://wenle.shinyapps.io/PPOT_LSS/). CONCLUSIONS: This predictive model can 
      facilitate identification of risk for prolonged operation time following PLIF 
      surgery. Predictive calculators are expected to improve preoperative planning, 
      identify patients with high risk factors, and help clinicians facilitating the 
      improvement of treatment plans and the implementation of clinical intervention.

AB  - In this editorial, we comment on the article by Zhang et al entitled Development 
      of a machine learning-based model for predicting the risk of early postoperative 
      recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is 
      characterized by high incidence and mortality rates, remains a major global 
      health challenge primarily due to the critical issue of postoperative recurrence. 
      Early recurrence, defined as recurrence that occurs within 2 years posttreatment, 
      is linked to the hidden spread of the primary tumor and significantly impacts 
      patient survival. Traditional predictive factors, including both patient- and 
      treatment-related factors, have limited predictive ability with respect to HCC 
      recurrence. The integration of machine learning algorithms is fueled by the 
      exponential growth of computational power and has revolutionized HCC research. 
      The study by Zhang et al demonstrated the use of a groundbreaking preoperative 
      prediction model for early postoperative HCC recurrence. Chall-enges persist, 
      including sample size constraints, issues with handling data, and the need for 
      further validation and interpretability. This study emphasizes the need for 
      collaborative efforts, multicenter studies and comparative analyses to validate 
      and refine the model. Overcoming these challenges and exploring innovative 
      approaches, such as multi-omics integration, will enhance personalized oncology 
      care. This study marks a significant stride toward precise, effi-cient, and 
      personalized oncology practices, thus offering hope for improved patient outcomes 
      in the field of HCC treatment.

AB  - Precision psychiatry is an emerging field with transformative opportunities for 
      mental health. However, the use of clinical prediction models carries 
      unprecedented ethical challenges, which must be addressed before accessing the 
      potential benefits of precision psychiatry. This critical review covers 
      multidisciplinary areas, including psychiatry, ethics, statistics and 
      machine-learning, healthcare and academia, as well as input from people with 
      lived experience of mental disorders, their family, and carers. We aimed to 
      identify core ethical considerations for precision psychiatry and mitigate 
      concerns by designing a roadmap for research and clinical practice. We identified 
      priorities: learning from somatic medicine; identifying precision psychiatry use 
      cases; enhancing transparency and generalizability; fostering implementation; 
      promoting mental health literacy; communicating risk estimates; data protection 
      and privacy; and fostering the equitable distribution of mental health care. We 
      hope this blueprint will advance research and practice and enable people with 
      mental health problems to benefit from precision psychiatry.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mood disorders are characterized by heterogeneity in severity, 
      symptoms and treatment response. The possibility of selecting the correct therapy 
      on the basis of patient-specific biomarker may be a considerable step towards 
      personalized psychiatry. Machine learning methods are gaining increasing 
      popularity in the medical field. Once trained, the possibility to consider single 
      patients in the analyses instead of whole groups makes them particularly 
      appealing to investigate treatment response. Deep learning, a branch of machine 
      learning, lately gained attention, due to its effectiveness in dealing with large 
      neuroimaging data and to integrate them with clinical, molecular or -omics 
      biomarkers. METHODS: In this mini-review, we summarize studies that use deep 
      learning methods to predict response to treatment in depression. We performed a 
      bibliographic search on PUBMED, Google Scholar and Web of Science using the terms 
      "psychiatry", "mood disorder", "depression", "treatment", "deep learning", 
      "neural networks". Only studies considering patients' datasets are considered. 
      RESULTS: Eight studies met the inclusion criteria. Accuracies in prediction of 
      response to therapy were considerably high in all studies, but results may be not 
      easy to interpret. LIMITATIONS: The major limitation for the current studies is 
      the small sample size, which constitutes an issue for machine learning methods. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Deep learning shows promising results in terms of prediction of 
      treatment response, often outperforming regression methods and reaching 
      accuracies of around 80%. This could be of great help towards personalized 
      medicine. However, more efforts are needed in terms of increasing datasets size 
      and improved interpretability of results.

TI  - Explainable deep transfer learning model for disease risk prediction using 
      high-dimensional genomic data.

AB  - Building an accurate disease risk prediction model is an essential step in the 
      modern quest for precision medicine. While high-dimensional genomic data provides 
      valuable data resources for the investigations of disease risk, their huge amount 
      of noise and complex relationships between predictors and outcomes have brought 
      tremendous analytical challenges. Deep learning model is the state-of-the-art 
      methods for many prediction tasks, and it is a promising framework for the 
      analysis of genomic data. However, deep learning models generally suffer from the 
      curse of dimensionality and the lack of biological interpretability, both of 
      which have greatly limited their applications. In this work, we have developed a 
      deep neural network (DNN) based prediction modeling framework. We first proposed 
      a group-wise feature importance score for feature selection, where genes 
      harboring genetic variants with both linear and non-linear effects are 
      efficiently detected. We then designed an explainable transfer-learning based DNN 
      method, which can directly incorporate information from feature selection and 
      accurately capture complex predictive effects. The proposed DNN-framework is 
      biologically interpretable, as it is built based on the selected predictive 
      genes. It is also computationally efficient and can be applied to genome-wide 
      data. Through extensive simulations and real data analyses, we have demonstrated 
      that our proposed method can not only efficiently detect predictive features, but 
      also accurately predict disease risk, as compared to many existing methods.

OAB - This article explores how artificial intelligence (AI) is being used to improve 
      healthcare. AI can analyze large amounts of data quickly, helping doctors detect 
      diseases earlier, plan treatments more accurately, and manage patient records 
      more efficiently. It is particularly useful in cancer diagnosis, dental health, 
      brain tumor analysis, and personalized treatment planning. For example, AI tools 
      can examine medical images to spot tumors or oral issues that may be missed by 
      the human eye, and machine learning algorithms can suggest treatment options 
      based on a patient’s unique history and health data. The study highlights 
      successful applications of AI, such as using advanced image recognition to 
      identify cancer, optimizing dental procedures, and improving brain tumor 
      classification. Despite these benefits, challenges remain. These include concerns 
      over data privacy, the fairness and transparency of AI decisions, the need for 
      high-quality training data, and ensuring that medical professionals are trained 
      to use AI effectively. The authors recommend stronger ethical guidelines, better 
      education for healthcare workers, and improved validation of AI systems. With 
      ongoing research and careful integration, AI has the potential to make healthcare 
      more precise, efficient, and personalized, ultimately improving outcomes for 
      patients and supporting doctors in delivering high-quality care.

AB  - Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) remains a critical challenge in 
      intensive care, marked by high mortality and significant patient heterogeneity, 
      which limits the effectiveness of conventional supportive therapies. This review 
      highlights the transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and 
      Machine Learning (ML) in revolutionizing ARDS management. We explore diverse 
      AI/ML applications, including early prediction and diagnosis using multi-modal 
      data (electronic health records [EHR], imaging, ventilator waveforms), advanced 
      prognostic assessment and risk stratification that outperform traditional scoring 
      systems, and precise identification of ARDS subtypes to guide personalized 
      treatment. Furthermore, we detail AI's role in optimizing mechanical ventilation 
      (e.g., PEEP settings, patient-ventilator asynchrony detection, mechanical 
      power-guided strategies), facilitating Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) 
      support decisions, and advancing drug discovery. The review also delves into 
      cutting-edge methodologies such as Graph Neural Networks, Causal Inference, 
      Federated Learning, Self-Supervised Learning, and the emerging paradigm of Large 
      Language Models (LLMs) and agent-based AI, which promise enhanced data 
      integration, privacy-preserving research, and autonomous decision support. 
      Despite challenges in data quality, model generalizability, interpretability, and 
      clinical integration, AI-driven strategies offer unprecedented opportunities for 
      precision medicine, real-time decision support, and ultimately, improved patient 
      outcomes in ARDS.

AB  - The use of artificial intelligence (AI) within pathology and health care has 
      advanced extensively. We have accordingly witnessed an increased adoption of 
      various AI tools that are transforming our approach to clinical decision support, 
      personalized medicine, predictive analytics, automation, and discovery. The 
      familiar and more reliable AI tools that have been incorporated within health 
      care thus far fall mostly under the nongenerative AI domain, which includes 
      supervised and unsupervised machine learning (ML) techniques. This review article 
      explores how such nongenerative AI methods, rooted in traditional rules-based 
      systems, enhance diagnostic accuracy, efficiency, and consistency within 
      medicine. Key concepts and the application of supervised learning models (ie, 
      classification and regression) such as decision trees, support vector machines, 
      linear and logistic regression, K-nearest neighbor, and neural networks are 
      explained along with the newer landscape of neural network-based nongenerative 
      foundation models. Unsupervised learning techniques, including clustering, 
      dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection, are also discussed for their 
      roles in uncovering novel disease subtypes or identifying outliers. Technical 
      details related to the application of nongenerative AI algorithms for analyzing 
      whole slide images are also highlighted. The performance, explainability, and 
      reliability of nongenerative AI models essential for clinical decision-making is 
      also reviewed, as well as challenges related to data quality, model 
      interpretability, and risk of data drift. An understanding of which AI-ML models 
      to employ and which shortcomings need to be addressed is imperative to safely and 
      efficiently leverage, integrate, and monitor these traditional AI tools in 
      clinical practice and research.

AB  - Personalized time-to-event or survival prediction with right-censored outcomes is 
      a pervasive challenge in healthcare research. Although various supervised machine 
      learning methods, such as random survival forests or neural networks, have been 
      adapted to handle such outcomes effectively, they do not provide explanations for 
      their predictions, lacking interpretability. In this paper, an alternative method 
      for survival prediction by weighted nearest neighbors is proposed. Fitting this 
      model to data entails optimizing the weights by learning a metric. An individual 
      prediction of this method can be explained by providing the user with the most 
      influential data points for this prediction, i.e., the closest data points and 
      their weights. The strengths and weaknesses in terms of predictive performance 
      are highlighted on simulated data and an application of the method on two 
      different real-world datasets of breast cancer patients shows its competitiveness 
      with established methods.

TI  - Ladies and Gentlemen! This is no humbug. Why Model-Guided Medicine will become a 
      main pillar for the future healthcare system.
PG  - 1919-1927

AB  - PURPOSE: Model-Guided Medicine (MGM) is a transformative approach to health care 
      that offers a comprehensive and integrative perspective that goes far beyond our 
      current concepts. In this editorial, we want to take a closer look at this 
      innovative concept and how health care could benefit from its further development 
      and application. METHODS: The information presented here is primarily the opinion 
      of the authors and is based on their knowledge in the fields of information 
      technology, computer science, and medicine. The contents are also the result of 
      numerous discussions and scientific meetings within the CARS Society and the CARS 
      Workshop on Model-Guided Medicine and are substantially stimulated by the 
      available literature on the subject. RESULTS: The current healthcare landscape, 
      with its reliance on isolated data points and broad population-based 
      recommendations, often fails to integrate the dynamic and patient-specific 
      factors necessary for truly personalised care. MGM addresses these limitations by 
      integrating recent advancements in data processing, artificial intelligence, and 
      human-computer interaction for the creation of individual models which integrate 
      the available information and knowledge of patients, healthcare providers, 
      devices, environment, etc. Based on a holistic concept, MGM will become effective 
      tool for modern medicine, which shows a unique ability to assess and analyse 
      interconnected relations and the combined impact of multiple factors on the 
      individual. MGM emphasises transparency, reproducibility, and interpretability, 
      ensuring that models are not black boxes but tools that healthcare professionals 
      can fully understand, validate, and apply in clinical practice. CONCLUSION: The 
      practical applications of MGM are vast, ranging from optimising individual 
      treatment plans to enhancing the efficiency of entire healthcare systems. The 
      research community is called upon to pioneer new projects that demonstrate MGM's 
      potential, establishing it as a central pillar of future health care, where more 
      personalised, predictive, and effective medical practices will hopefully become 
      the standard.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence in Atrial Fibrillation: From Early Detection to Precision 
      Therapy.
LID - 10.3390/jcm14082627 [doi]
LID - 2627
AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent cardiac arrhythmia, associated 
      with significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare burden. Despite advances in 
      AF management, challenges persist in early detection, risk stratification, and 
      treatment optimization, necessitating innovative solutions. Artificial 
      intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative tool in AF care, leveraging 
      machine learning and deep learning algorithms to enhance diagnostic accuracy, 
      improve risk prediction, and guide therapeutic interventions. AI-powered 
      electrocardiographic screening has demonstrated the ability to detect 
      asymptomatic AF, while wearable photoplethysmography-based technologies have 
      expanded real-time rhythm monitoring beyond clinical settings. AI-driven 
      predictive models integrate electronic health records and multimodal 
      physiological data to refine AF risk stratification, stroke prediction, and 
      anticoagulation decision making. In the realm of treatment, AI is revolutionizing 
      individualized therapy and optimizing anticoagulation management and catheter 
      ablation strategies. Notably, AI-enhanced electroanatomic mapping and real-time 
      procedural guidance hold promise for improving ablation success rates and 
      reducing AF recurrence. Despite these advancements, the clinical integration of 
      AI in AF management remains an evolving field. Future research should focus on 
      large-scale validation, model interpretability, and regulatory frameworks to 
      ensure widespread adoption. This review explores the current and emerging 
      applications of AI in AF, highlighting its potential to enhance precision 
      medicine and patient outcomes.

TI  - Artificial intelligence-based preventive, personalized and precision medicine for 
      cardiovascular disease/stroke risk assessment in rheumatoid arthritis patients: a 
      narrative review.
PG  - 1965-1982
LID - 10.1007/s00296-023-05415-1 [doi]
AB  - The challenges associated with diagnosing and treating cardiovascular disease 
      (CVD)/Stroke in Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) arise from the delayed onset of 
      symptoms. Existing clinical risk scores are inadequate in predicting cardiac 
      events, and conventional risk factors alone do not accurately classify many 
      individuals at risk. Several CVD biomarkers consider the multiple pathways 
      involved in the development of atherosclerosis, which is the primary cause of 
      CVD/Stroke in RA. To enhance the accuracy of CVD/Stroke risk assessment in the RA 
      framework, a proposed approach involves combining genomic-based biomarkers (GBBM) 
      derived from plasma and/or serum samples with innovative non-invasive 
      radiomic-based biomarkers (RBBM), such as measurements of synovial fluid, plaque 
      area, and plaque burden. This review presents two hypotheses: (i) RBBM and GBBM 
      biomarkers exhibit a significant correlation and can precisely detect the 
      severity of CVD/Stroke in RA patients. (ii) Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based 
      preventive, precision, and personalized (aiP(3)) CVD/Stroke risk AtheroEdge™ 
      model (AtheroPoint™, CA, USA) that utilizes deep learning (DL) to accurately 
      classify the risk of CVD/stroke in RA framework. The authors conducted a 
      comprehensive search using the PRISMA technique, identifying 153 studies that 
      assessed the features/biomarkers of RBBM and GBBM for CVD/Stroke. The study 
      demonstrates how DL models can be integrated into the AtheroEdge™-aiP(3) 
      framework to determine the risk of CVD/Stroke in RA patients. The findings of 
      this review suggest that the combination of RBBM with GBBM introduces a new 
      dimension to the assessment of CVD/Stroke risk in the RA framework. Synovial 
      fluid levels that are higher than normal lead to an increase in the plaque 
      burden. Additionally, the review provides recommendations for novel, unbiased, 
      and pruned DL algorithms that can predict CVD/Stroke risk within a RA framework 
      that is preventive, precise, and personalized.

AB  - Hypertension is a significant global health challenge, contributing substantially 
      to morbidity and mortality through its association with various cardiovascular 
      diseases. Traditional approaches to hypertension risk prediction, which rely on 
      broad epidemiological data and common risk factors, often fail to account for 
      individual variability, highlighting the need for advanced data-driven 
      methodologies. This review examines the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and 
      Machine Learning (ML) in enhancing the prediction of hypertension risk by 
      incorporating a range of data sources, including clinical, lifestyle, and genetic 
      factors. Despite promising developments, challenges such as data standardisation, 
      the need for high-quality datasets, model explainability, and class imbalance in 
      medical data persist. The integration of wearable technologies, alongside the 
      potential of emerging technologies in healthcare such as digital twins, presents 
      significant opportunities in personalising care through the dynamic modelling of 
      individual health profiles. This review synthesises current methodologies, 
      identifies existing gaps, and highlights the transformative potential of 
      AI-driven, personalised hypertension prevention and management, emphasising the 
      importance of addressing issues of reproducibility and transparency to facilitate 
      clinical adoption.

TI  - Model science and modelling informatics for a model identity card/certificate 
      (MIC) in radiology and surgery.
PG  - 1561-1566
LID - 10.1007/s11548-025-03431-z [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: A model identity card/certificate (MIC) aims at enhancing 
      trustworthiness in systems that purport to provide intelligent responses to human 
      questions and actions. It should serve those individuals who have a professional 
      need for or who want to feel more comfortable, when writing about or interacting 
      with intelligent machines. The general and/or specific domain models on which 
      recommendations, decisions or actions of these systems are based, reflect in 
      their MIC the level of model relevance, truthfulness and transparency. METHODS: 
      In the specific context of CARS, methods and tools for building models and their 
      corresponding templates for a MIC in the domains of radiology and surgery should 
      be drawn from relevant elements of a model science, specifically from 
      mathematical modelling methods (e.g. for model truthfulness) and modelling 
      informatics tools (e.g. for model transparency). Modelling methods for radiology 
      and surgery may be drawn from applied mathematics, mathematical logic and/or 
      syntax graph based text. Examples of supporting tools from modelling informatics 
      are UML, MIMMS, model-based software engineering or model-based medical evidence. 
      RESULTS: For a Model Guided Precision Medicine as defined by SPIE MI 2025, a 
      precise protocol relating to the origins of these models need to be reflected in 
      the corresponding MIC templates for specific medical domains, for example, in 
      radiology or surgery. An example of a MIC template (work-in-progress) in the 
      domain of orthopaedic surgery serves to demonstrate some aspects of model 
      relevance, truthfulness and transparency. CONCLUSION: Gaining trustworthiness in 
      intelligent systems based on models and related AI tools is a challenging 
      undertaking and raises many critical questions, specifically those related to 
      ascertain model relevance, truthfulness and transparency. The healthcare system, 
      in particular, will have to be concerned about the availability of digital 
      identity certificates for these systems and related artefacts, e.g. digital 
      twins, avatars, robots, intelligent agents, etc. Further development of the 
      elements of a model science with emphasis on modelling informatics may be the 
      right path to take, preferably in cooperation with international R&D groups 
      interested in the realisation of an MGM and corresponding MICs.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence for Autonomous Molecular Design: A Perspective.
LID - 10.3390/molecules26226761 [doi]
LID - 6761
AB  - Domain-aware artificial intelligence has been increasingly adopted in recent 
      years to expedite molecular design in various applications, including drug design 
      and discovery. Recent advances in areas such as physics-informed machine learning 
      and reasoning, software engineering, high-end hardware development, and computing 
      infrastructures are providing opportunities to build scalable and explainable AI 
      molecular discovery systems. This could improve a design hypothesis through 
      feedback analysis, data integration that can provide a basis for the introduction 
      of end-to-end automation for compound discovery and optimization, and enable more 
      intelligent searches of chemical space. Several state-of-the-art ML architectures 
      are predominantly and independently used for predicting the properties of small 
      molecules, their high throughput synthesis, and screening, iteratively 
      identifying and optimizing lead therapeutic candidates. However, such deep 
      learning and ML approaches also raise considerable conceptual, technical, 
      scalability, and end-to-end error quantification challenges, as well as 
      skepticism about the current AI hype to build automated tools. To this end, 
      synergistically and intelligently using these individual components along with 
      robust quantum physics-based molecular representation and data generation tools 
      in a closed-loop holds enormous promise for accelerated therapeutic design to 
      critically analyze the opportunities and challenges for their more widespread 
      application. This article aims to identify the most recent technology and 
      breakthrough achieved by each of the components and discusses how such autonomous 
      AI and ML workflows can be integrated to radically accelerate the protein target 
      or disease model-based probe design that can be iteratively validated 
      experimentally. Taken together, this could significantly reduce the timeline for 
      end-to-end therapeutic discovery and optimization upon the arrival of any novel 
      zoonotic transmission event. Our article serves as a guide for medicinal, 
      computational chemistry and biology, analytical chemistry, and the ML community 
      to practice autonomous molecular design in precision medicine and drug discovery.

TI  - Liquid Biopsy-Based Detection and Response Prediction for Depression.
PG  - 32498-32507
LID - 10.1021/acsnano.4c08233 [doi]
AB  - Proactively predicting antidepressant treatment response before medication 
      failures is crucial, as it reduces unsuccessful attempts and facilitates the 
      development of personalized therapeutic strategies, ultimately enhancing 
      treatment efficacy. The current decision-making process, which heavily depends on 
      subjective indicators, underscores the need for an objective, indicator-based 
      approach. This study developed a method for detecting depression and predicting 
      treatment response through deep learning-based spectroscopic analysis of 
      extracellular vesicles (EVs) from plasma. EVs were isolated from the plasma of 
      both nondepressed and depressed groups, followed by Raman signal acquisition, 
      which was used for AI algorithm development. The algorithm successfully 
      distinguished depression patients from healthy individuals and those with panic 
      disorder, achieving an AUC accuracy of 0.95. This demonstrates the model's 
      capability to selectively diagnose depression within a nondepressed group, 
      including those with other mental health disorders. Furthermore, the algorithm 
      identified depression-diagnosed patients likely to respond to antidepressants, 
      classifying responders and nonresponders with an AUC accuracy of 0.91. To 
      establish a diagnostic foundation, the algorithm applied explainable AI (XAI), 
      enabling personalized medicine for companion diagnostics and highlighting its 
      potential for the development of liquid biopsy-based mental disorder diagnosis.

AB  - The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has opened new 
      avenues for advancing personalized immunotherapy in cancer treatment. This review 
      highlights current research progress in applying AI to optimize the use of 
      immunotherapy for patients with cancer. Recent studies demonstrate that AI models 
      can accurately diagnose cancers and discover biomarkers by integrating 
      multi-omics and imaging data, establish predictive models to estimate treatment 
      responses and adverse reactions, formulate personalized treatment plans 
      integrating multiple modalities by considering various factors, and achieve 
      precise patient stratification and clinical trial matching, thereby addressing 
      specific obstacles throughout processes from diagnosis to treatment in 
      personalized immunotherapy. Furthermore, this review also discusses the 
      challenges and limitations faced by AI in clinical applications, such as 
      difficulties in data acquisition, low quality of data, poor interpretability of 
      models, and insufficient generalization ability. Finally, we outline future 
      research directions, including optimizing data management, developing explainable 
      AI, and improving the generalization ability of models. These efforts aim to 
      optimize the role of AI in personalized immunotherapy and promote the development 
      of precision medicine. To ensure the clinical applicability of these AI models, 
      large-scale studies, multi-omics integration, and prospective clinical trials are 
      necessary.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Research into the acute kidney disease (AKD) after acute ischemic 
      stroke (AIS) is rare, and how clinical features influence its prognosis remain 
      unknown. We aim to employ interpretable machine learning (ML) models to study AIS 
      and clarify its decision-making process in identifying the risk of mortality. 
      METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study involving AIS patients from 
      January 2020 to June 2021. Patient data were randomly divided into training and 
      test sets. Eight ML algorithms were employed to construct predictive models for 
      mortality. The performance of the best model was evaluated using various metrics. 
      Furthermore, we created an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven web application 
      that leveraged the top ten most crucial features for mortality prediction. 
      RESULTS: The study cohort consisted of 1633 AIS patients, among whom 257 (15.74%) 
      developed subacute AKD, 173 (10.59%) experienced AKI recovery, and 65 (3.98%) met 
      criteria for both AKI and AKD. The mortality rate stood at 4.84%. The LightGBM 
      model displayed superior performance, boasting an AUROC of 0.96 for mortality 
      prediction. The top five features linked to mortality were ACEI/ARE, renal 
      function trajectories, neutrophil count, diuretics, and serum creatinine. 
      Moreover, we designed a web application using the LightGBM model to estimate 
      mortality risk. CONCLUSIONS: Complete renal function trajectories, including AKI 
      and AKD, are vital for fitting mortality in AIS patients. An interpretable ML 
      model effectively clarified its decision-making process for identifying AIS 
      patients at risk of mortality. The AI-driven web application has the potential to 
      contribute to the development of personalized early mortality prevention.

AB  - This review critically analyzes how machine learning is being used to support 
      clinical decision-making in the management of potentially resectable pancreatic 
      cancer. Following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
      Meta-analyses) guidelines, electronic searches of MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, and 
      Cochrane Database were undertaken. Studies were assessed using the checklist for 
      critical appraisal and data extraction for systematic reviews of prediction 
      modeling studies (CHARMS) checklist. In total 89,959 citations were retrieved. 
      Six studies met the inclusion criteria. Three studies were Markov 
      decision-analysis models comparing neoadjuvant therapy versus upfront surgery. 
      Three studies predicted survival time using Bayesian modeling (n = 1) and 
      artificial neural network (n = 1), and one study explored machine learning 
      algorithms including Bayesian network, decision trees, k-nearest neighbor, and 
      artificial neural networks. The main methodological issues identified were 
      limited data sources, which limits generalizability and potentiates bias; lack of 
      external validation; and the need for transparency in methods of internal 
      validation, consecutive sampling, and selection of candidate predictors. The 
      future direction of research relies on expanding our view of the 
      multidisciplinary team to include professionals from computing and data science 
      with algorithms developed in conjunction with clinicians and viewed as aids, not 
      replacement, to traditional clinical decision-making.

AB  - In ever more pressured health-care systems, technological solutions offering 
      scalability of care and better resource targeting are appealing. Research on 
      machine learning as a technique for identifying individuals at risk of suicidal 
      ideation, suicide attempts, and death has grown rapidly. This research often 
      places great emphasis on the promise of machine learning for preventing suicide, 
      but overlooks the practical, clinical implementation issues that might preclude 
      delivering on such a promise. In this Review, we synthesise the broad empirical 
      and review literature on electronic health record-based machine learning in 
      suicide research, and focus on matters of crucial importance for implementation 
      of machine learning in clinical practice. The challenge of preventing 
      statistically rare outcomes is well known; progress requires tackling data 
      quality, transparency, and ethical issues. In the future, machine learning models 
      might be explored as methods to enable targeting of interventions to specific 
      individuals depending upon their level of need-ie, for precision medicine. 
      Primarily, however, the promise of machine learning for suicide prevention is 
      limited by the scarcity of high-quality scalable interventions available to 
      individuals identified by machine learning as being at risk of suicide.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence Applications in Cardio-Oncology: A Comprehensive Review.
PG  - 56
LID - 10.1007/s11886-025-02215-w [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review explores the role of artificial intelligence (AI) 
      in cardio-oncology, focusing on its latest application across problems in 
      diagnosis, prognosis, risk stratification, and management of cardiovascular (CV) 
      complications in cancer patients. It also highlights multi-omics analysis, 
      explainable AI, and real-time decision-making, while addressing challenges like 
      data heterogeneity and ethical concerns. RECENT FINDINGS: AI can advance 
      cardio-oncology by leveraging imaging, electronic health records (EHRs), 
      electrocardiograms (ECG), and multi-omics data for early cardiotoxicity 
      detection, stratification and long-term risk prediction. Novel AI-ECG models and 
      imaging techniques improve diagnostic accuracy, while multi-omics analysis 
      identifies biomarkers for personalized treatment. However, significant barriers, 
      including data heterogeneity, lack of transparency, and regulatory challenges, 
      hinder widespread adoption. AI significantly enhances early detection and 
      intervention in cardio-oncology. Future efforts should address the impact of AI 
      technologies on clinical outcomes, and ethical challenges, to enable broader 
      clinical adoption and improve patient care.

TI  - Empowering Precision Medicine: Unlocking Revolutionary Insights through 
      Blockchain-Enabled Federated Learning and Electronic Medical Records.
LID - 10.3390/s23177476 [doi]
LID - 7476
AB  - Precision medicine has emerged as a transformative approach to healthcare, aiming 
      to deliver personalized treatments and therapies tailored to individual patients. 
      However, the realization of precision medicine relies heavily on the availability 
      of comprehensive and diverse medical data. In this context, blockchain-enabled 
      federated learning, coupled with electronic medical records (EMRs), presents a 
      groundbreaking solution to unlock revolutionary insights in precision medicine. 
      This abstract explores the potential of blockchain technology to empower 
      precision medicine by enabling secure and decentralized data sharing and 
      analysis. By leveraging blockchain's immutability, transparency, and 
      cryptographic protocols, federated learning can be conducted on distributed EMR 
      datasets without compromising patient privacy. The integration of blockchain 
      technology ensures data integrity, traceability, and consent management, thereby 
      addressing critical concerns associated with data privacy and security. Through 
      the federated learning paradigm, healthcare institutions and research 
      organizations can collaboratively train machine learning models on locally stored 
      EMR data, without the need for data centralization. The blockchain acts as a 
      decentralized ledger, securely recording the training process and aggregating 
      model updates while preserving data privacy at its source. This approach allows 
      the discovery of patterns, correlations, and novel insights across a wide range 
      of medical conditions and patient populations. By unlocking revolutionary 
      insights through blockchain-enabled federated learning and EMRs, precision 
      medicine can revolutionize healthcare delivery. This paradigm shift has the 
      potential to improve diagnosis accuracy, optimize treatment plans, identify 
      subpopulations for clinical trials, and expedite the development of novel 
      therapies. Furthermore, the transparent and auditable nature of blockchain 
      technology enhances trust among stakeholders, enabling greater collaboration, 
      data sharing, and collective intelligence in the pursuit of advancing precision 
      medicine. In conclusion, this abstract highlights the transformative potential of 
      blockchain-enabled federated learning in empowering precision medicine. By 
      unlocking revolutionary insights from diverse and distributed EMR datasets, this 
      approach paves the way for a future where healthcare is personalized, efficient, 
      and tailored to the unique needs of each patient.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare by enhancing 
      diagnostics, treatment personalization, and operational efficiency. In aesthetic 
      medicine-a field blending medical expertise with artistic judgment-AI is 
      increasingly being used to improve precision, optimize treatment outcomes, and 
      personalize patient care. However, its integration presents both opportunities 
      and ethical challenges, necessitating a critical evaluation of its role in this 
      evolving field. OBJECTIVE: This study examines AI's applications in aesthetic 
      medicine, focusing on its role in facial analysis, robotic-assisted procedures, 
      predictive patient outcome modeling, and personalized treatment planning. 
      Additionally, it explores ethical concerns, algorithmic biases, data privacy 
      issues, and regulatory challenges affecting AI adoption in aesthetic practices. 
      METHODS: A comprehensive review of AI-driven technologies in aesthetic medicine 
      was conducted, analyzing literature on machine learning (ML), deep learning, and 
      computer vision applications. Case studies on AI-assisted facial symmetry 
      analysis, robotic hair transplantation, and predictive analytics in patient care 
      were examined to evaluate AI's effectiveness and limitations. RESULTS: AI 
      enhances aesthetic procedures by improving diagnostic accuracy, offering virtual 
      simulations of treatment outcomes, and enabling hyper-personalized treatment 
      plans based on patient data. AI-driven chatbots and virtual assistants streamline 
      patient interactions, while robotic systems assist in precision-based tasks such 
      as laser treatments and hair restoration. However, challenges such as biased 
      training data, lack of transparency in AI decision-making, and inconsistencies in 
      regulatory approvals hinder widespread adoption. The integration of AI in 
      aesthetic medicine presents a paradigm shift from traditional approaches to 
      data-driven, personalized interventions. However, ethical concerns such as data 
      privacy, informed consent, and algorithmic fairness must be addressed. 
      Overreliance on AI may diminish the human-centric approach essential in aesthetic 
      procedures, where patient expectations and subjective perceptions of beauty play 
      a crucial role. Collaboration between technologists, clinicians, and policymakers 
      is necessary to develop standardized AI guidelines that ensure fairness, safety, 
      and efficacy. CONCLUSION: AI has the potential to revolutionize aesthetic 
      medicine by improving precision, efficiency, and patient satisfaction. However, 
      its successful implementation requires balancing technological advancements with 
      ethical considerations and regulatory frameworks. Future research should focus on 
      integrating AI with emerging technologies such as augmented reality (AR) and 
      genomic-based personalization to enhance aesthetic outcomes while maintaining 
      transparency and patient trust.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) holds immense promise for accelerating and improving 
      all aspects of drug discovery, not least target discovery and validation. By 
      integrating a diverse range of biological data modalities, AI enables the 
      accurate prediction of drug target properties, ultimately illuminating biological 
      mechanisms of disease and guiding drug discovery strategies. Despite the 
      indisputable potential of AI in drug target discovery, there are many challenges 
      and obstacles yet to be overcome, including dealing with data biases, model 
      interpretability and generalisability, and the validation of predicted drug 
      targets, to name a few. By exploring recent advancements in AI, this review 
      showcases current applications of AI for drug target discovery and offers 
      perspectives on the future of AI for the discovery and validation of drug 
      targets, paving the way for the generation of novel and safer pharmaceuticals.

TI  - Interpretable machine learning predicts cardiac resynchronization therapy 
      responses from personalized biochemical and biomechanical features.
PG  - 282

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) is a widely used, 
      device-based therapy for patients with left ventricle (LV) failure. 
      Unfortunately, many patients do not benefit from CRT, so there is potential value 
      in identifying this group of non-responders before CRT implementation. Past 
      studies suggest that predicting CRT response will require diverse variables, 
      including demographic, biomarker, and LV function data. Accordingly, the 
      objective of this study was to integrate diverse variable types into a machine 
      learning algorithm for predicting individual patient responses to CRT. METHODS: 
      We built an ensemble classification algorithm using previously acquired data from 
      the SMART-AV CRT clinical trial (n = 794 patients). We used five-fold stratified 
      cross-validation on 80% of the patients (n = 635) to train the model with 
      variables collected at 0 months (before initiating CRT), and the remaining 20% of 
      the patients (n = 159) were used as a hold-out test set for model validation. To 
      improve model interpretability, we quantified feature importance values using 
      SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis and used Local Interpretable 
      Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) to explain patient-specific predictions. 
      RESULTS: Our classification algorithm incorporated 26 patient demographic and 
      medical history variables, 12 biomarker variables, and 18 LV functional 
      variables, which yielded correct prediction of CRT response in 71% of patients. 
      Additional patient stratification to identify the subgroups with the highest or 
      lowest likelihood of response showed 96% accuracy with 22 correct predictions out 
      of 23 patients in the highest and lowest responder groups. CONCLUSION: 
      Computationally integrating general patient characteristics, comorbidities, 
      therapy history, circulating biomarkers, and LV function data available before 
      CRT intervention can improve the prediction of individual patient responses.

AB  - Neurologists nowadays no longer view neurodegenerative diseases, like Parkinson's 
      and Alzheimer's disease, as single entities, but rather as a spectrum of 
      multifaceted symptoms with heterogeneous progression courses and treatment 
      responses. The definition of the naturalistic behavioral repertoire of early 
      neurodegenerative manifestations is still elusive, impeding early diagnosis and 
      intervention. Central to this view is the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in 
      reinforcing the depth of phenotypic information, thereby supporting the paradigm 
      shift to precision medicine and personalized healthcare. This suggestion 
      advocates the definition of disease subtypes in a new biomarker-supported 
      nosology framework, yet without empirical consensus on standardization, 
      reliability and interpretability. Although the well-defined neurodegenerative 
      processes, linked to a triad of motor and non-motor preclinical symptoms, are 
      detected by clinical intuition, we undertake an unbiased data-driven approach to 
      identify different patterns of neuropathology distribution based on the 
      naturalistic behavior data inherent to populations in-the-wild. We appraise the 
      role of remote technologies in the definition of digital phenotyping specific to 
      brain-, body- and social-level neurodegenerative subtle symptoms, emphasizing 
      inter- and intra-patient variability powered by deep learning. As such, the 
      present review endeavors to exploit digital technologies and AI to create 
      disease-specific phenotypic explanations, facilitating the understanding of 
      neurodegenerative diseases as "bio-psycho-social" conditions. Not only does this 
      translational effort within explainable digital phenotyping foster the 
      understanding of disease-induced traits, but it also enhances diagnostic and, 
      eventually, treatment personalization.

AB  - Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into drug discovery has revolutionized 
      pharmaceutical innovation, addressing the challenges of traditional methods that 
      are costly, time-consuming, and suffer from high failure rates. By utilizing 
      machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and natural language processing (NLP), 
      AI enhances various stages of drug development, including target identification, 
      lead optimization, de novo drug design, and drug repurposing. AI tools, such as 
      AlphaFold for protein structure prediction and AtomNet for structure-based drug 
      design, have significantly accelerated the discovery process, improved efficiency 
      and reduced costs. Success stories like Insilico Medicine's AI-designed molecule 
      for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and BenevolentAI's identification of 
      baricitinib for COVID-19 highlight AI's transformative potential. Additionally, 
      AI enables the exploration of vast chemical spaces, optimization of clinical 
      trials, and the identification of novel therapeutic targets, paving the way for 
      precision medicine. However, challenges such as limited data accessibility, 
      integration of diverse datasets, interpretability of AI models, and ethical 
      concerns remain critical hurdles. Overcoming these limitations through enhanced 
      algorithms, standardized databases, and interdisciplinary collaboration is 
      essential. Overall, AI continues to reshape drug discovery, reducing timelines, 
      increasing success rates, and driving the development of innovative and 
      accessible therapies for unmet medical needs.

      challenges, and future directions.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: AI has emerged as a transformative force in clinical 
      medicine, changing the diagnosis, treatment, and management of patients. Tools 
      have been derived for working with ML, DL, and NLP algorithms to analyze large 
      complex medical datasets with unprecedented accuracy and speed, thereby improving 
      diagnostic precision, treatment personalization, and patient care outcomes. For 
      example, CNNs have dramatically improved the accuracy of medical imaging 
      diagnoses, and NLP algorithms have greatly helped extract insights from 
      unstructured data, including EHRs. However, there are still numerous challenges 
      that face AI integration into clinical workflows, including data privacy, 
      algorithmic bias, ethical dilemmas, and problems with the interpretability of 
      "black-box" AI models. These barriers have thus far prevented the widespread 
      application of AI in health care, and its possible trends, obstacles, and future 
      implications are necessary to be systematically explored. The purpose of this 
      paper is, therefore, to assess the current trends in AI applications in clinical 
      medicine, identify those obstacles that are hindering adoption, and identify 
      possible future directions. This research hopes to synthesize evidence from other 
      peer-reviewed articles to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the role 
      that AI plays to advance clinical practices, improve patient outcomes, or enhance 
      decision-making. METHODS: A systematic review was done according to the PRISMA 
      guidelines to explore the integration of Artificial Intelligence in clinical 
      medicine, including trends, challenges, and future directions. PubMed, Cochrane 
      Library, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were searched for peer-reviewed 
      articles from 2014 to 2024 with keywords such as "Artificial Intelligence in 
      Medicine," "AI in Clinical Practice," "Machine Learning in Healthcare," and 
      "Ethical Implications of AI in Medicine." Studies focusing on AI application in 
      diagnostics, treatment planning, and patient care reporting measurable clinical 
      outcomes were included. Non-clinical AI applications and articles published 
      before 2014 were excluded. Selected studies were screened for relevance, and then 
      their quality was critically appraised to synthesize data reliably and 
      rigorously. RESULTS: This systematic review includes the findings of 8 studies 
      that pointed out the transformational role of AI in clinical medicine. AI tools, 
      such as CNNs, had diagnostic accuracy more than the traditional methods, 
      particularly in radiology and pathology. Predictive models efficiently supported 
      risk stratification, early disease detection, and personalized medicine. Despite 
      these improvements, significant hurdles, including data privacy, algorithmic 
      bias, and resistance from clinicians regarding the "black-box" nature of AI, had 
      yet to be surmounted. XAI has emerged as an attractive solution that offers the 
      promise to enhance interpretability and trust. As a whole, AI appeared promising 
      in enhancing diagnostics, treatment personalization, and clinical workflows by 
      dealing with systemic inefficiencies. CONCLUSION: The transformation potential of 
      AI in clinical medicine can transform diagnostics, treatment strategies, and 
      efficiency. Overcoming obstacles such as concerns about data privacy, the danger 
      of algorithmic bias, and difficulties with interpretability may pave the way for 
      broader use and facilitate improvement in patient outcomes while transforming 
      clinical workflows to bring sustainability into healthcare delivery.

TI  - Leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to accelerate discovery 
      of disease-modifying therapies in type 1 diabetes.
PG  - 477-494
LID - 10.1007/s00125-024-06339-6 [doi]
AB  - Progress in developing therapies for the maintenance of endogenous insulin 
      secretion in, or the prevention of, type 1 diabetes has been hindered by limited 
      animal models, the length and cost of clinical trials, difficulties in 
      identifying individuals who will progress faster to a clinical diagnosis of type 
      1 diabetes, and heterogeneous clinical responses in intervention trials. Classic 
      placebo-controlled intervention trials often include monotherapies, broad 
      participant populations and extended follow-up periods focused on clinical 
      endpoints. While this approach remains the 'gold standard' of clinical research, 
      efforts are underway to implement new approaches harnessing the power of 
      artificial intelligence and machine learning to accelerate drug discovery and 
      efficacy testing. Here, we review emerging approaches for repurposing agents used 
      to treat diseases that share pathogenic pathways with type 1 diabetes and 
      selecting synergistic combinations of drugs to maximise therapeutic efficacy. We 
      discuss how emerging multi-omics technologies, including analysis of antigen 
      processing and presentation to adaptive immune cells, may lead to the discovery 
      of novel biomarkers and subsequent translation into antigen-specific 
      immunotherapies. We also discuss the potential for using artificial intelligence 
      to create 'digital twin' models that enable rapid in silico testing of 
      personalised agents as well as dose determination. To conclude, we discuss some 
      limitations of artificial intelligence and machine learning, including issues 
      pertaining to model interpretability and bias, as well as the continued need for 
      validation studies via confirmatory intervention trials.

AB  - The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into acupuncture research is 
      accelerating the transformation of this traditional, experience-based practice 
      into a data-driven, precision discipline. This review synthesizes recent advances 
      in AI-enabled outcome prediction techniques, encompassing deep learning, 
      meta-analytic modeling, natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and 
      neuroimaging-based analysis. For instance, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) 
      have been successfully applied to classify tongue images and detect ZHENG 
      patterns, while transformer-based NLP models enable automated extraction of 
      clinical knowledge from classical texts. These technologies improve diagnostic 
      objectivity, standardize treatment planning, and facilitate individualized care 
      by enabling longitudinal efficacy modeling and real-time monitoring. Despite 
      their potential, current implementations are constrained by limited and 
      heterogeneous datasets, annotation variability, and gaps in clinical validation. 
      We analyze key methodological innovations and challenges, and recommend future 
      directions including the construction of federated multimodal data platforms, 
      development of explainable AI frameworks, and promotion of open science 
      practices. This convergence of AI and acupuncture presents a unique opportunity 
      to enhance scientific rigor, clinical utility, and global integration of 
      acupuncture within the paradigm of precision integrative medicine.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains a significant complication of 
      prematurity, impacting approximately 18,000 infants annually in the United 
      States. Advances in neonatal care have not reduced BPD, and its management is 
      challenged by the rising survival of extremely premature infants and the 
      variability in clinical practices. Leveraging statistical and machine learning 
      techniques, predictive analytics can enhance BPD management by utilizing large 
      clinical datasets to predict individual patient outcomes. This review explores 
      the foundations and applications of predictive analytics in the context of BPD, 
      examining commonly used data sources, modeling techniques, and metrics for model 
      evaluation. We also highlight bioinformatics' potential role in understanding 
      BPD's molecular basis and discuss case studies demonstrating the use of machine 
      learning models for risk prediction and prognosis in neonates. Challenges such as 
      data bias, model complexity, and ethical considerations are outlined, along with 
      strategies to address these issues. Future directions for advancing the 
      integration of predictive analytics into clinical practice include improving 
      model interpretability, expanding data sharing and interoperability, and aligning 
      predictive models with precision medicine goals. By overcoming current 
      challenges, predictive analytics holds promise for transforming neonatal care and 
      providing personalized interventions for infants at risk of BPD.

TI  - Enabling Personalized Medicine in Orthopaedic Surgery Through Artificial 
      Intelligence: A Critical Analysis Review.
LID - e23.00232 [doi]
AB  - » The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of orthopaedic 
      surgery holds potential for revolutionizing health care delivery across 3 crucial 
      domains: (I) personalized prediction of clinical outcomes and adverse events, 
      which may optimize patient selection, surgical planning, and enhance patient 
      safety and outcomes; (II) diagnostic automated and semiautomated imaging 
      analyses, which may reduce time burden and facilitate precise and timely 
      diagnoses; and (III) forecasting of resource utilization, which may reduce health 
      care costs and increase value for patients and institutions.» Computer vision is 
      one of the most highly studied areas of AI within orthopaedics, with applications 
      pertaining to fracture classification, identification of the manufacturer and 
      model of prosthetic implants, and surveillance of prosthesis loosening and 
      failure.» Prognostic applications of AI within orthopaedics include identifying 
      patients who will likely benefit from a specified treatment, predicting 
      prosthetic implant size, postoperative length of stay, discharge disposition, and 
      surgical complications. Not only may these applications be beneficial to patients 
      but also to institutions and payors because they may inform potential cost 
      expenditure, improve overall hospital efficiency, and help anticipate resource 
      utilization.» AI infrastructure development requires institutional financial 
      commitment and a team of clinicians and data scientists with expertise in AI that 
      can complement skill sets and knowledge. Once a team is established and a goal is 
      determined, teams (1) obtain, curate, and label data; (2) establish a reference 
      standard; (3) develop an AI model; (4) evaluate the performance of the AI model; 
      (5) externally validate the model, and (6) reinforce, improve, and evaluate the 
      model's performance until clinical implementation is possible.» Understanding the 
      implications of AI in orthopaedics may eventually lead to wide-ranging 
      improvements in patient care. However, AI, while holding tremendous promise, is 
      not without methodological and ethical limitations that are essential to address. 
      First, it is important to ensure external validity of programs before their use 
      in a clinical setting. Investigators should maintain high quality data records 
      and registry surveillance, exercise caution when evaluating others' reported AI 
      applications, and increase transparency of the methodological conduct of current 
      models to improve external validity and avoid propagating bias. By addressing 
      these challenges and responsibly embracing the potential of AI, the medical field 
      may eventually be able to harness its power to improve patient care and outcomes.

AB  - The complex pathophysiology and diverse manifestations of esophageal disorders 
      pose challenges in clinical practice, particularly in achieving accurate early 
      diagnosis and risk stratification. While traditional approaches rely heavily on 
      subjective interpretations and variable expertise, machine learning (ML) has 
      emerged as a transformative tool in healthcare. We conducted a comprehensive 
      review of published literature on ML applications in esophageal diseases, 
      analyzing technical approaches, validation methods, and clinical outcomes. ML 
      demonstrates superior performance: In gastroesophageal reflux disease, ML models 
      achieve 80%-90% accuracy in potential of hydrogen-impedance analysis and 
      endoscopic grading; for Barrett's esophagus, ML-based approaches show 88%-95% 
      accuracy in invasive diagnostics and 77%-85% accuracy in non-invasive screening. 
      In esophageal cancer, ML improves early detection and survival prediction by 
      6%-10% compared to traditional methods. Novel applications in achalasia and 
      esophageal varices demonstrate promising results in automated diagnosis and risk 
      stratification, with accuracy rates exceeding 85%. While challenges persist in 
      data standardization, model interpretability, and clinical integration, emerging 
      solutions in federated learning and explainable artificial intelligence offer 
      promising pathways forward. The continued evolution of these technologies, 
      coupled with rigorous validation and thoughtful implementation, may fundamentally 
      transform our approach to esophageal disease management in the era of precision 
      medicine.

      Ejection Fraction.
PG  - 305-312
LID - 10.1007/s12265-016-9727-8 [doi]
AB  - Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a heterogeneous 
      clinical syndrome that may benefit from improved subtyping in order to better 
      characterize its pathophysiology and to develop novel targeted therapies. The 
      United States Precision Medicine Initiative comes amid the rapid growth in 
      quantity and modality of clinical data for HFpEF patients ranging from deep 
      phenotypic to trans-omic data. Tensor factorization, a form of machine learning, 
      allows for the integration of multiple data modalities to derive clinically 
      relevant HFpEF subtypes that may have significant differences in underlying 
      pathophysiology and differential response to therapies. Tensor factorization also 
      allows for better interpretability by supporting dimensionality reduction and 
      identifying latent groups of data for meaningful summarization of both features 
      and disease outcomes. In this narrative review, we analyze the modest literature 
      on the application of tensor factorization to related biomedical fields including 
      genotyping and phenotyping. Based on the cited work including work of our own, we 
      suggest multiple tensor factorization formulations capable of integrating the 
      deep phenotypic and trans-omic modalities of data for HFpEF, or accounting for 
      interactions between genetic variants at different omic hierarchies. We encourage 
      extensive experimental studies to tackle challenges in applying tensor 
      factorization for precision medicine in HFpEF, including effectively 
      incorporating existing medical knowledge, properly accounting for uncertainty, 
      and efficiently enforcing sparsity for better interpretability.

TI  - Advancing healthcare: the role and impact of AI and foundation models.
PG  - 2166-2179
LID - 10.62347/WQWV9220 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into the healthcare 
      domain is a monumental shift with profound implications for diagnostics, medical 
      interventions, and the overall structure of healthcare systems. PURPOSE: This 
      study explores the transformative journey of foundation AI models in healthcare, 
      shedding light on the challenges, ethical considerations, and vast potential they 
      hold for improving patient outcome and system efficiency. Notably, in this 
      investigation we observe a relatively slow adoption of AI within the public 
      sector of healthcare. The evolution of AI in healthcare is un-paralleled, 
      especially its prowess in revolutionizing diagnostic processes. RESULTS: This 
      research showcases how these foundational models can unravel hidden patterns 
      within complex medical datasets. The impact of AI reverberates through medical 
      interventions, encompassing pathology, imaging, genomics, and personalized 
      healthcare, positioning AI as a cornerstone in the quest for precision medicine. 
      The paper delves into the applications of generative AI models in critical facets 
      of healthcare, including decision support, medical imaging, and the prediction of 
      protein structures. The study meticulously evaluates various AI models, such as

      large-scale imaging data and clinical information, AI enhances diagnostic 
      accuracy, predicts treatment outcomes, and supports personalized patient care. 
      SUMMARY: As AI models continue to evolve, particularly with the use of large 
      models and generative AI techniques, they will further refine diagnosis and 
      treatment planning. While challenges remain, including issues related to data 
      diversity and model interpretability, AI's integration into ophthalmology 
      promises to improve healthcare outcomes, making it a cornerstone of data-driven 
      medical practice. The continued development and application of AI will 
      undoubtedly transform the future of anterior segment ophthalmology, leading to 
      more efficient, accurate, and individualized care.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence in Glaucoma: Advances in Diagnosis, Progression 
      Forecasting, and Surgical Outcome Prediction.
LID - 10.3390/ijms26104473 [doi]
LID - 4473
AB  - Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness, with challenges persisting 
      in early diagnosis, disease progression, and surgical outcome prediction. Recent 
      advances in artificial intelligence have enabled significant progress by 
      extracting clinically relevant patterns from structural, functional, and 
      molecular data. This review outlines the current applications of artificial 
      intelligence in glaucoma care, including early detection using fundus photography 
      and OCT and disease progression prediction using deep learning architectures such 
      as convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, transformer models, 
      generative adversarial networks, and autoencoders. Surgical outcome forecasting 
      has been enhanced through multimodal models that integrate electronic health 
      records and imaging data. We also highlight emerging AI applications in omics 
      analysis, including transcriptomics and metabolomics, for biomarker discovery and 
      individualized risk stratification. Despite these advances, key challenges remain 
      in interpretability, integration of heterogeneous data, and the lack of 
      personalized surgical timing guidance. Future work should focus on transparent, 
      generalizable, and multimodal AI models, supported by large, well-curated 
      datasets, to advance precision medicine in glaucoma.

AB  - The advancements in data acquisition, storage, and processing techniques have 
      resulted in the rapid growth of heterogeneous medical data. Integrating 
      radiological scans, histopathology images, and molecular information with 
      clinical data is essential for developing a holistic understanding of the disease 
      and optimizing treatment. The need for integrating data from multiple sources is 
      further pronounced in complex diseases such as cancer for enabling precision 
      medicine and personalized treatments. This work proposes Multimodal Integration 
      of Oncology Data System (MINDS)-a flexible, scalable, and cost-effective metadata 
      framework for efficiently fusing disparate data from public sources such as the 
      Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC) into an interconnected, patient-centric 
      framework. MINDS consolidates over 41,000 cases from across repositories while 
      achieving a high compression ratio relative to the 3.78 PB source data size. It 
      offers sub-5-s query response times for interactive exploration. MINDS offers an 
      interface for exploring relationships across data types and building cohorts for 
      developing large-scale multimodal machine learning models. By harmonizing 
      multimodal data, MINDS aims to potentially empower researchers with greater 
      analytical ability to uncover diagnostic and prognostic insights and enable 
      evidence-based personalized care. MINDS tracks granular end-to-end data 
      provenance, ensuring reproducibility and transparency. The cloud-native 
      architecture of MINDS can handle exponential data growth in a secure, 
      cost-optimized manner while ensuring substantial storage optimization, 
      replication avoidance, and dynamic access capabilities. Auto-scaling, access 
      controls, and other mechanisms guarantee pipelines' scalability and security. 
      MINDS overcomes the limitations of existing biomedical data silos via an 
      interoperable metadata-driven approach that represents a pivotal step toward the 
      future of oncology data integration.

AB  - Precision medicine presents challenges in data collection, cost, and privacy as 
      it tailors treatments to each patient's unique genetic and clinical profile. With 
      its ability to produce realistic and confidential patient data, generative 
      artificial intelligence (AI) offers a promising avenue that could revolutionize 
      patient-centric healthcare. This systematic review aims to assess the role of 
      generative AI in personalized medicine. Following the Preferred Reporting Items 
      for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we searched PubMed, 
      Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, and Google Scholar, identifying 549 studies. 
      After removing duplicates and applying eligibility criteria, 27 studies were 
      found relevant and were included in this systematic review. Generative 
      adversarial networks (GANs) were the most commonly used models (16 studies), 
      followed by variational autoencoders (VAEs; seven studies). These models were 
      primarily applied to drug response prediction, treatment effect estimation, 
      biomarker discovery, and patient stratification. Generative AI models have shown 
      significant promise in revolutionizing personalized medicine by enabling precise 
      treatment predictions and patient-specific therapeutic insights. Despite their 
      potential, challenges related to model validation, interpretability, and bias 
      remain. Future research should prioritize large-scale validation studies using 
      diverse datasets to enhance the clinical applicability and reliability of these 
      AI-driven approaches.

      enhancing precision, efficiency, and patient outcomes. With global healthcare 
      systems increasingly adopting AI-driven technologies, the integration of robotics 
      in surgery addresses critical challenges such as surgical accuracy, minimally 
      invasive techniques, and healthcare accessibility. However, disparities in access 
      and ethical concerns regarding automation persist globally, necessitating a 
      balanced discourse on these advancements. The primary objective of the review is 
      to explore the intersection of AI and robotic technologies in surgical practices, 
      highlighting key innovations, their impact on precision medicine, and future 
      trajectories. The novelty of the review lies in synthesizing findings across 
      diverse surgical specialties, including urology, plastic surgery, ophthalmology, 
      and pediatric surgery, to provide a comprehensive understanding of AI's 
      transformative role. The systematic review evaluates the integration of AI and 
      robotics in surgery, synthesizing studies published in 2024. It follows PRISMA 
      guidelines for study selection, data extraction, and synthesis. The review 
      assesses surgical specialties, AI technologies, and outcomes like accuracy, 
      recovery, and complications, ensuring methodological rigor and transparency. The 
      findings indicate substantial advancements in AI-driven surgical systems, 
      improving decision-making, reducing surgical errors, and facilitating 
      personalized treatment strategies. Notable breakthroughs include AI-enhanced 
      imaging, real-time data analysis, and automated robotic instruments, which 
      collectively improve procedural efficiency and patient safety. The discussion 
      emphasizes the critical implications of these innovations, particularly in 
      advancing minimally invasive techniques and expanding surgical capabilities in 
      complex procedures. However, challenges such as cost, ethical considerations, and 
      the need for rigorous training protocols are highlighted as barriers to 
      widespread adoption. The review underscores the implications for policymakers, 
      healthcare institutions, and technology developers to address these barriers and 
      promote equitable access to AI-driven surgical solutions. Limitations include the 
      reliance on recent studies, necessitating long-term evaluations of clinical 
      outcomes. Future research should focus on integrating AI with emerging 
      technologies like augmented reality, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, 
      and addressing socio-ethical dimensions to fully realize the potential of AI in 
      surgical advancements.

TI  - Trustworthy artificial intelligence and ethical design: public perceptions of 
      trustworthiness of an AI-based decision-support tool in the context of 
      intrapartum care.
PG  - 42
LID - 10.1186/s12910-023-00917-w [doi]
LID - 42
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the recognition that developing artificial intelligence (AI) 
      that is trustworthy is necessary for public acceptability and the successful 
      implementation of AI in healthcare contexts, perspectives from key stakeholders 
      are often absent from discourse on the ethical design, development, and 
      deployment of AI. This study explores the perspectives of birth parents and 
      mothers on the introduction of AI-based cardiotocography (CTG) in the context of 
      intrapartum care, focusing on issues pertaining to trust and trustworthiness. 
      METHODS: Seventeen semi-structured interviews were conducted with birth parents 
      and mothers based on a speculative case study. Interviewees were based in England 
      and were pregnant and/or had given birth in the last two years. Thematic analysis 
      was used to analyze transcribed interviews with the use of NVivo. Major recurring 
      themes acted as the basis for identifying the values most important to this 
      population group for evaluating the trustworthiness of AI. RESULTS: Three themes 
      pertaining to the perceived trustworthiness of AI emerged from interviews: (1) 
      trustworthy AI-developing institutions, (2) trustworthy data from which AI is 
      built, and (3) trustworthy decisions made with the assistance of AI. We found 
      that birth parents and mothers trusted public institutions over private companies 
      to develop AI, that they evaluated the trustworthiness of data by how 
      representative it is of all population groups, and that they perceived 
      trustworthy decisions as being mediated by humans even when supported by AI. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The ethical values that underscore birth parents and mothers' 
      perceptions of trustworthy AI include fairness and reliability, as well as 
      practices like patient-centered care, the promotion of publicly funded 
      healthcare, holistic care, and personalized medicine. Ultimately, these are also 
      the ethical values that people want to protect in the healthcare system. 
      Therefore, trustworthy AI is best understood not as a list of design features but 
      in relation to how it undermines or promotes the ethical values that matter most 
      to its end users. An ethical commitment to these values when creating AI in 
      healthcare contexts opens up new challenges and possibilities for the design and 
      deployment of AI.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence and Multi-Omics in Pharmacogenomics: A New Era of 
      Precision Medicine.
PG  - 100246
LID - 10.1016/j.mcpdig.2025.100246 [doi]
LID - 100246
AB  - Pharmacogenomics is entering a transformative phase as high-throughput "omics" 
      techniques become increasingly integrated with state-of-the-art artificial 
      intelligence (AI) methods. Although early successes in single-gene 
      pharmacogenetics reported clear clinical benefits, many drug response phenotypes 
      are governed by intricate networks of genomic variants, epigenetic modifications, 
      and metabolic pathways. Multi-omics approaches address this complexity by 
      capturing genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data layers, 
      offering a comprehensive view of patient-specific biology. Advanced AI models, 
      including deep neural networks, graph neural networks, and representation 
      learning techniques, further enhance this landscape by detecting hidden patterns, 
      filling gaps in incomplete data sets, and enabling in silico simulations of 
      treatment responses. Such capabilities not only improve predictive accuracy but 
      also deepen mechanistic insights, revealing how gene-gene and gene-environment 
      interactions shape therapeutic outcomes. At the same time, real-world data from 
      diverse patient populations is broadening the evidence base, underscoring the 
      importance of inclusive datasets and population-specific algorithms to reduce 
      health disparities. Despite challenges related to data harmonization, 
      interpretability, and regulatory oversight, the synergy between multi-omics 
      integration and AI-driven analytics holds relevant promise for revolutionizing 
      clinical decision-making. In this review, we highlighted key technological 
      advances, discussed current limitations, and outlined future directions for 
      translating multi-omics plus AI innovations into routine personalized medicine.

TI  - Using artificial intelligence and predictive modelling to enable learning 
      healthcare systems (LHS) for pandemic preparedness.
PG  - 412-419
LID - 10.1016/j.csbj.2024.05.014 [doi]
AB  - In anticipation of potential future pandemics, we examined the challenges and 
      opportunities presented by the COVID-19 outbreak. This analysis highlights how 
      artificial intelligence (AI) and predictive models can support both patients and 
      clinicians in managing subsequent infectious diseases, and how legislators and 
      policymakers could support these efforts, to bring learning healthcare system 
      (LHS) from guidelines to real-world implementation. This report chronicles the 
      trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic, emphasizing the diverse data sets generated 
      throughout its course. We propose strategies for harnessing this data via AI and 
      predictive modelling to enhance the functioning of LHS. The challenges faced by 
      patients and healthcare systems around the world during this unprecedented crisis 
      could have been mitigated with an informed and timely adoption of the three 
      pillars of the LHS: Knowledge, Data and Practice. By harnessing AI and predictive 
      analytics, we can develop tools that not only detect potential pandemic-prone 
      diseases early on but also assist in patient management, provide decision 
      support, offer treatment recommendations, deliver patient outcome triage, predict 
      post-recovery long-term disease impacts, monitor viral mutations and variant 
      emergence, and assess vaccine and treatment efficacy in real-time. A 
      patient-centric approach remains paramount, ensuring patients are both informed 
      and actively involved in disease mitigation strategies.

      organoids (PDOs) was time-consuming, costly, and had low success rates for 
      certain cancer types, which limited their clinical utility. This study aimed to 
      develop an interpretable deep learning-based model to predict the cultivation 
      outcome of ovarian cancer organoids in advance. METHODS: Longitudinal microscopy 
      images of 517 ovarian cancer organoid droplets were divided into training (n = 
      325), validation (n = 88), and test (n = 104) sets. Subsequently, growth 
      prediction models were developed based on four neural network backbones 
      (ResNet18, VGG11, ConvNeXt v2, and Swin Transformer v2), and specific 
      optimization methods were designed for better prediction. Finally, 179 samples 
      from multiple centers were collected for prospective validation, and the 
      gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) method was used for 
      interpretability analysis of the deep model to reveal the basis of the model's 
      decisions. RESULTS: The test set showed that the deep learning models could 
      achieve high-performance prediction at the third stage with area under the curve 
      (AUC) values greater than 0.8 for all four models. The homogeneous transfer 
      learning optimization method improved the AUC from 0.833 to 0.884 (P = 0.0039). 
      In prospective validation, the optimized model achieved an AUC of 0.832, a Brier 
      score of 0.1919 in the calibration curve, and a greater net benefit in the 
      decision curve. Interpretability analysis revealed that the area where organoids 
      are being formed and have already formed is important for prediction. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our developed models achieved satisfactory results in predicting the 
      growth of ovarian cancer organoids. There is potential for further development of 
      the model toward process automation.

AB  - Precision medicine has gained considerable popularity since the 
      "one-size-fits-all" approach did not seem very effective or reflective of the 
      complexity of the human body. Subsequently, since single-omics does not reflect 
      the complexity of the human body's inner workings, it did not result in the 
      expected advancement in the medical field. Therefore, the multi-omics approach 
      has emerged. The multi-omics approach involves integrating data from different 
      omics technologies, such as DNA sequencing, RNA sequencing, mass spectrometry, 
      and others, using computational methods and then analyzing the integrated result 
      for different downstream analysis applications such as survival analysis, cancer 
      classification, or biomarker identification. Most of the recent reviews were 
      constrained to discussing one aspect of the multi-omics analysis pipeline, such 
      as the dimensionality reduction step, the integration methods, or the 
      interpretability aspect; however, very few provide a comprehensive review of 
      every step of the analysis. This study aims to give an overview of the 
      multi-omics analysis pipeline, starting with the most popular multi-omics 
      databases used in recent literature, dimensionality reduction techniques, details 
      the different types of data integration techniques and their downstream analysis 
      applications, describes the most commonly used evaluation metrics, highlights the 
      importance of model interpretability, and lastly discusses the challenges and 
      potential future work for multi-omics data integration in precision medicine.

AB  - Stakeholders across the entire healthcare chain are looking to incorporate 
      artificial intelligence (AI) into their decision-making process. From early-stage 
      drug discovery to clinical decision support systems, we have seen examples of how 
      AI can improve efficiency and decrease costs. In this Opinion, we discuss some of 
      the key factors that should be prioritized to enable the successful integration 
      of AI across the healthcare value chain. In particular, we believe a focus on 
      model interpretability is crucial to obtain a deeper understanding of the 
      underlying biological mechanisms and guide further investigations. Additionally, 
      we discuss the importance of integrating diverse types of data within any AI 
      framework to limit bias, increase accuracy, and model the interdisciplinary 
      nature of medicine. We believe that widespread adoption of these practices will 
      help accelerate the continued integration of AI into our current healthcare 
      framework.

AB  - The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in a variety of research fields is 
      speeding up multiple digital revolutions, from shifting paradigms in healthcare, 
      precision medicine and wearable sensing, to public services and education offered 
      to the masses around the world, to future cities made optimally efficient by 
      autonomous driving. When a revolution happens, the consequences are not obvious 
      straight away, and to date, there is no uniformly adapted framework to guide AI 
      research to ensure a sustainable societal transition. To answer this need, here 
      we analyze three key challenges to interdisciplinary AI research, and deliver 
      three broad conclusions: 1) future development of AI should not only impact other 
      scientific domains but should also take inspiration and benefit from other fields 
      of science, 2) AI research must be accompanied by decision explainability, 
      dataset bias transparency as well as development of evaluation methodologies and 
      creation of regulatory agencies to ensure responsibility, and 3) AI education 
      should receive more attention, efforts and innovation from the educational and 
      scientific communities. Our analysis is of interest not only to AI practitioners 
      but also to other researchers and the general public as it offers ways to guide 
      the emerging collaborations and interactions toward the most fruitful outcomes.

TI  - Multimodal and Multidimensional Artificial Intelligence Technology in Obesity.
LID - 10.7570/jomes25035 [doi]
AB  - Although the prevalence of obesity is increasing worldwide, related treatment 
      remains a complex challenge that requires multidimensional approaches. Recent 
      advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to the development of 
      multimodal methods capable of integrating diverse types of data. These AI 
      approaches utilize both multimodal data integration and multidimensional feature 
      representations, enabling personalized, data-driven strategies for obesity 
      management. AI can support obesity management through applications such as risk 
      prediction, clinical decision support systems, large language models, and digital 
      therapeutics. Several studies have shown that these AI-based weight loss programs 
      can achieve significant weight reduction and behavioral changes. These AI systems 
      can induce behavioral modifications through continuous personalized feedback and 
      improve accessibility for people in underserved areas. However, these AI 
      technologies must address issues such as data privacy and security, transparency 
      and accountability, and consider the potential widening health disparities 
      between individuals who have access to AI technology and those who do not, as 
      well as strategies for sustained user engagement. Conducting long-term clinical 
      trials and evaluations of cost-effectiveness across diverse, large-scale 
      populations would facilitate the effective application of AI in obesity 
      management, ultimately contributing to improvements in public health.

AB  - Sepsis associated-acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) is a common complication of 
      sepsis, which has a high incidence and is closely related to a poor prognosis. 
      However, delayed diagnosis and non-specific treatments make it difficult to 
      systematically manage SA-AKI. Based on massive clinical data, machine learning 
      could build prediction models, which provide alarms and suggestions for the 
      clinical decision support system. Although there are still many challenges such 
      as poor interpretability, it has shown clinical application value in SA-SKI risk 
      prediction, imaging diagnosis, subtype identification, prognosis assessment, and 
      so on. Based on a brief introduction of machine learning, this article reviews 
      the application, limitations, and future directions of machine learning in the 
      diagnosis and treatment of SA-AKI, and explores the possibility of machine 
      learning in the medical field, in order to promote the development of precision 
      medicine and intelligent medicine.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enhanced histopathology presents unprecedented 
      opportunities to benefit oncology through interpretable methods that require only 
      one overall label per hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slide with no tissue-level 
      annotations. We present a structured review of these methods organized by their 
      degree of verifiability and by commonly recurring application areas in 
      oncological characterization. First, we discuss morphological markers (tumor 
      presence/absence, metastases, subtypes, grades) in which AI-identified regions of 
      interest (ROIs) within whole slide images (WSIs) verifiably overlap with 
      pathologist-identified ROIs. Second, we discuss molecular markers (gene 
      expression, molecular subtyping) that are not verified via H&E but rather based 
      on overlap with positive regions on adjacent tissue. Third, we discuss genetic 
      markers (mutations, mutational burden, microsatellite instability, chromosomal 
      instability) that current technologies cannot verify if AI methods spatially 
      resolve specific genetic alterations. Fourth, we discuss the direct prediction of 
      survival to which AI-identified histopathological features quantitatively 
      correlate but are nonetheless not mechanistically verifiable. Finally, we discuss 
      in detail several opportunities and challenges for these one-label-per-slide 
      methods within oncology. Opportunities include reducing the cost of research and 
      clinical care, reducing the workload of clinicians, personalized medicine, and 
      unlocking the full potential of histopathology through new imaging-based 
      biomarkers. Current challenges include explainability and interpretability, 
      validation via adjacent tissue sections, reproducibility, data availability, 
      computational needs, data requirements, domain adaptability, external validation, 
      dataset imbalances, and finally commercialization and clinical potential. 
      Ultimately, the relative ease and minimum upfront cost with which relevant data 
      can be collected in addition to the plethora of available AI methods for 
      outcome-driven analysis will surmount these current limitations and achieve the 
      innumerable opportunities associated with AI-driven histopathology for the 
      benefit of oncology.

TI  - Artificial intelligence-assisted decision making for prognosis and drug efficacy 
      prediction in lung cancer patients: a narrative review.
PG  - 7021-7033
LID - 10.21037/jtd-21-864 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this review, we aim to present frontier studies in patients with 
      lung cancer as it related to artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted 
      decision-making and summarize the latest advances, challenges and future trend in 
      this field. BACKGROUND: Despite increasing survival rate in cancer patients over 
      the last decades, lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of death 
      worldwide. The early diagnosis, accurate evaluation and individualized treatment 
      are vital approaches to improve the survival rate of patients with lung cancer. 
      Thus, decision making based on these approaches requires accuracy and efficiency 
      beyond manpower. Recent advances in AI and precision medicine have provided a 
      fertile environment for the development of AI-based models. These models have the 
      potential to assist radiologists and oncologists in detecting lung cancer, 
      predicting prognosis and developing personalized treatment plans for better 
      outcomes of the patients. METHODS: We searched literature from 2000 through July 
      31(th), 2021 in Medline/PubMed, the Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, ACM 
      Digital Library, INSPEC and EMBASE. Key words such as "artificial intelligence", 
      "AI", "deep learning", "lung cancer", "NSCLC", "SCLC" were combined to identify 
      related literatures. These literatures were then selected by two independent 
      authors. Articles chosen by only one author will be examined by another author to 
      determine whether this article was relative and valuable. The selected 
      literatures were read by all authors and discussed to draw reliable conclusions. 
      CONCLUSIONS: AI, especially for those based on deep learning and radiomics, is 
      capable of assisting clinical decision making from many aspects, for its 
      quantitatively interpretation of patients' information and its potential to deal 
      with the dynamics, individual differences and heterogeneity of lung cancer. 
      Hopefully, remaining problems such as insufficient data and poor interpretability 
      may be solved to put AI-based models into clinical practice.

AB  - An important impediment to the incorporation of artificial intelligence-based 
      tools into healthcare is their association with so-called black box medicine, a 
      concept arising due to their complexity and the difficulties in understanding how 
      they reach a decision. This situation may compromise the clinician's trust in 
      these tools, should any errors occur, and the inability to explain how decisions 
      are reached may affect their relationship with patients. Explainable AI (XAI) 
      aims to overcome this limitation by facilitating a better understanding of how AI 
      models reach their conclusions for users, thereby enhancing trust in the 
      decisions reached. This review first defined the concepts underlying XAI, 
      establishing the tools available and how they can benefit digestive healthcare. 
      Examples of the application of XAI in digestive healthcare were provided, and 
      potential future uses were proposed. In addition, aspects of the regulatory 
      frameworks that must be established and the ethical concerns that must be borne 
      in mind during the development of these tools were discussed. Finally, we 
      considered the challenges that this technology faces to ensure that optimal 
      benefits are reaped, highlighting the need for more research into the use of XAI 
      in this field.

TI  - Artificial intelligence in clinical thrombosis and hemostasis: A review.
PG  - 102984
LID - 10.1016/j.rpth.2025.102984 [doi]
LID - 102984
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are 
      transforming hemostasis and thrombosis care, with applications spanning disease 
      detection, risk assessment, laboratory testing, patient education, personalized 
      medicine, and drug development. This narrative review explores AI's clinical 
      utility and limitations across these 6 domains. METHODS: A comprehensive search 
      of PubMed, Embase, and Scopus (up to February 2025) was conducted using terms 
      related to AI, thrombosis, and hemostasis. Peer-reviewed, English-language 
      studies were included, supplemented by manual and reference screening. Of 84 
      studies included, 38 focused on risk assessment, 16 on diagnostics, and others on 
      personalized medicine, drug development, and patient engagement. RESULTS: AI 
      demonstrated high accuracy in diagnosing thrombotic events via imaging and 
      electronic health record analysis, although sensitivity gaps persisted for 
      complex cases. In laboratory settings, AI outperformed manual review in detecting 
      errors (eg, sample mislabeling and clotted specimens). Risk stratification models 
      surpassed traditional scores (eg, CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc) in predicting 
      thromboembolism, yet inconsistently performed in cancer-associated thrombosis. 
      Personalized anticoagulation dosing and genetic severity prediction in hemophilia 
      highlighted AI's precision. Chatbots and adherence tools have enhanced patient 
      education while AI-driven drug discovery identified novel anticoagulants and 
      repurposed existing therapies. Limitations included variable external validation, 
      "black box" interpretability issues, and dataset biases. CONCLUSION: AI offers 
      significant promise for improving diagnostics, risk prediction, and 
      individualized therapy in thrombosis and haemostasis. Future integration depends 
      on transparent, validated, and equitable AI systems embedded within clinical 
      workflows.

TI  - Towards the Interpretability of Machine Learning Predictions for Medical 
      Applications Targeting Personalised Therapies: A Cancer Case Survey.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22094394 [doi]
LID - 4394
AB  - Artificial Intelligence is providing astonishing results, with medicine being one 
      of its favourite playgrounds. Machine Learning and, in particular, Deep Neural 
      Networks are behind this revolution. Among the most challenging targets of 
      interest in medicine are cancer diagnosis and therapies but, to start this 
      revolution, software tools need to be adapted to cover the new requirements. In 
      this sense, learning tools are becoming a commodity but, to be able to assist 
      doctors on a daily basis, it is essential to fully understand how models can be 
      interpreted. In this survey, we analyse current machine learning models and other 
      in-silico tools as applied to medicine-specifically, to cancer research-and we 
      discuss their interpretability, performance and the input data they are fed with. 
      Artificial neural networks (ANN), logistic regression (LR) and support vector 
      machines (SVM) have been observed to be the preferred models. In addition, 
      convolutional neural networks (CNNs), supported by the rapid development of 
      graphic processing units (GPUs) and high-performance computing (HPC) 
      infrastructures, are gaining importance when image processing is feasible. 
      However, the interpretability of machine learning predictions so that doctors can 
      understand them, trust them and gain useful insights for the clinical practice is 
      still rarely considered, which is a factor that needs to be improved to enhance 
      doctors' predictive capacity and achieve individualised therapies in the near 
      future.

AB  - Bladder cancer (BC) is a serious and common malignant tumor of the urinary 
      system. Accurate and convenient diagnosis and treatment of BC is a major 
      challenge for the medical community. Due to the limited medical resources, the 
      existing diagnosis and treatment protocols for BC without the assistance of 
      artificial intelligence (AI) still have certain shortcomings. In recent years, 
      with the development of AI technologies such as deep learning and machine 
      learning, the maturity of AI has made it more and more applied to the medical 
      field, including improving the speed and accuracy of BC diagnosis and providing 
      more powerful treatment options and recommendations related to prognosis. 
      Advances in medical imaging technology and molecular-level research have also 
      contributed to the further development of such AI applications. However, due to 
      differences in the sources of training information and algorithm design issues, 
      there is still room for improvement in terms of accuracy and transparency for the 
      broader use of AI in clinical practice. With the popularization of digitization 
      of clinical information and the proposal of new algorithms, artificial 
      intelligence is expected to learn more effectively and analyze similar cases more 
      accurately and reliably, promoting the development of precision medicine, 
      reducing resource consumption, and speeding up diagnosis and treatment. This 
      review focuses on the application of artificial intelligence in the diagnosis and 
      treatment of BC, points out some of the challenges it faces, and looks forward to 
      its future development.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence for Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD); Accurately 
      Predicting Adverse Outcomes Using Machine Learning.
PG  - 4874-4885
LID - 10.1007/s10620-022-07506-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory Bowel Diseases with its complexity and heterogeneity 
      could benefit from the increased application of Artificial Intelligence in 
      clinical management. AIM: To accurately predict adverse outcomes in patients with 
      IBD using advanced computational models in a nationally representative dataset 
      for potential use in clinical practice. METHODS: We built a training model cohort 
      and validated our result in a separate cohort. We used LASSO and Ridge 
      regressions, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests and Neural Networks to 
      balance between complexity and interpretability and analyzed their relative 
      performances and reported the strongest predictors to the respective models. The 
      participants in our study were patients with IBD selected from The OptumLabs® 
      Data Warehouse (OLDW), a longitudinal, real-world data asset with de-identified 
      administrative claims and electronic health record (EHR) data. RESULTS: We 
      included 72,178 and 69,165 patients in the training and validation set, 
      respectively. In total, 4.1% of patients in the validation set were hospitalized, 
      2.9% needed IBD-related surgeries, 17% used long-term steroids and 13% of 
      patients were initiated with biological therapy. Of the AI models we tested, the 
      Random Forest and LASSO resulted in high accuracies (AUCs 0.70-0.92). Our 
      artificial neural network performed similarly well in most of the models (AUCs 
      0.61-0.90). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates feasibility of accurately 
      predicting adverse outcomes using complex and novel AI models on large 
      longitudinal data sets of patients with IBD. These models could be applied for 
      risk stratification and implementation of preemptive measures to avoid adverse 
      outcomes in a clinical setting.

TI  - Stress testing deep learning models for prostate cancer detection on biopsies and 
      surgical specimens.

AB  - The presence, location, and extent of prostate cancer is assessed by pathologists 
      using H&E-stained tissue slides. Machine learning approaches can accomplish these 
      tasks for both biopsies and radical prostatectomies. Deep learning approaches 
      using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to identify cancer in 
      pathologic slides, some securing regulatory approval for clinical use. However, 
      differences in sample processing can subtly alter the morphology between sample 
      types, making it unclear whether deep learning algorithms will consistently work 
      on both types of slide images. Our goal was to investigate whether morphological 
      differences between sample types affected the performance of biopsy-trained 
      cancer detection CNN models when applied to radical prostatectomies and vice 
      versa using multiple cohorts (N = 1,000). Radical prostatectomies (N = 100) and 
      biopsies (N = 50) were acquired from The University of Pennsylvania to train 
      (80%) and validate (20%) a DenseNet CNN for biopsies (M(B)), radical 
      prostatectomies (M(R)), and a combined dataset (M(B+R)). On a tile level, M(B) 
      and M(R) achieved F1 scores greater than 0.88 when applied to their own sample 
      type but less than 0.65 when applied across sample types. On a whole-slide level, 
      models achieved significantly better performance on their own sample type 
      compared to the alternative model (p < 0.05) for all metrics. This was confirmed 
      by external validation using digitized biopsy slide images from a clinical trial 
      [NRG Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)] (NRG/RTOG 0521, N = 750) via both 
      qualitative and quantitative analyses (p < 0.05). A comprehensive review of model 
      outputs revealed morphologically driven decision making that adversely affected 
      model performance. M(B) appeared to be challenged with the analysis of open gland 
      structures, whereas M(R) appeared to be challenged with closed gland structures, 
      indicating potential morphological variation between the training sets. These 
      findings suggest that differences in morphology and heterogeneity necessitate the 
      need for more tailored, sample-specific (i.e. biopsy and surgical) machine 
      learning models. © 2024 The Author(s). The Journal of Pathology published by John

TI  - Ulcerative Colitis, LAIR1 and TOX2 Expression, and Colorectal Cancer Deep 
      Learning Image Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks.
LID - 10.3390/cancers16244230 [doi]
LID - 4230
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease of the 
      colon mucosa associated with a higher risk of colorectal cancer. OBJECTIVE: This 
      study classified hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) histological images of ulcerative 
      colitis, normal colon, and colorectal cancer using artificial intelligence (deep 
      learning). METHODS: A convolutional neural network (CNN) was designed and trained 
      to classify the three types of diagnosis, including 35 cases of ulcerative 
      colitis (n = 9281 patches), 21 colon control (n = 12,246), and 18 colorectal 
      cancer (n = 63,725). The data were partitioned into training (70%) and validation 
      sets (10%) for training the network, and a test set (20%) to test the performance 
      on the new data. The CNNs included transfer learning from ResNet-18, and a 
      comparison with other CNN models was performed. Explainable artificial 
      intelligence for computer vision was used with the Grad-CAM technique, and 
      additional LAIR1 and TOX2 immunohistochemistry was performed in ulcerative 
      colitis to analyze the immune microenvironment. RESULTS: Conventional 
      clinicopathological analysis showed that steroid-requiring ulcerative colitis was 
      characterized by higher endoscopic Baron and histologic Geboes scores and LAIR1 
      expression in the lamina propria, but lower TOX2 expression in isolated lymphoid 
      follicles (all p values < 0.05) compared to mesalazine-responsive ulcerative 
      colitis. The CNN classification accuracy was 99.1% for ulcerative colitis, 99.8% 
      for colorectal cancer, and 99.1% for colon control. The Grad-CAM heatmap 
      confirmed which regions of the images were the most important. The CNNs also 
      differentiated between steroid-requiring and mesalazine-responsive ulcerative 
      colitis based on H&E, LAIR1, and TOX2 staining. Additional classification of 10 
      new cases of colorectal cancer (adenocarcinoma) were correctly classified. 
      CONCLUSIONS: CNNs are especially suited for image classification in conditions 
      such as ulcerative colitis and colorectal cancer; LAIR1 and TOX2 are relevant 
      immuno-oncology markers in ulcerative colitis.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are transforming spine 
      care by addressing diagnostics, treatment planning, and rehabilitation 
      challenges. This study highlights advancements in precision medicine for spinal 
      pathologies, leveraging AI and ML to enhance diagnostic accuracy through deep 
      learning algorithms, enabling faster and more accurate detection of 
      abnormalities. AI-powered robotics and surgical navigation systems improve 
      implant placement precision and reduce complications in complex spine surgeries. 
      Wearable devices and virtual platforms, designed with AI, offer personalized, 
      adaptive therapies that improve treatment adherence and recovery outcomes. AI 
      also enables preventive interventions by assessing spine condition risks early. 
      Despite progress, challenges remain, including limited healthcare datasets, 
      algorithmic biases, ethical concerns, and integration into existing systems. 
      Interdisciplinary collaboration and explainable AI frameworks are essential to 
      unlock AI's full potential in spine care. Future developments include multimodal 
      AI systems integrating imaging, clinical, and genetic data for holistic treatment

AB  - Parkinson's is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, affecting nearly 
      8.5M people and steadily increasing. In this research, Multimodal Deep Learning 
      is investigated for the Prodromal stage detection of Parkinson's Disease (PD), 
      combining different 3D architectures with the novel Excitation Network (EN) and 
      supported by Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques. Utilizing data 
      from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative, this study introduces a 
      joint co-learning approach for multimodal fusion, enabling end-to-end training of 
      deep neural networks and facilitating the learning of complementary information 
      from both imaging and clinical modalities. DenseNet with EN outperformed other 
      models, showing a substantial increase in accuracy when supplemented with 
      clinical data. XAI methods, such as Integrated Gradients for ResNet and DenseNet, 
      and Attention Heatmaps for Vision Transformer (ViT), revealed that DenseNet 
      focused on brain regions believed to be critical to prodromal pathophysiology, 
      including the right temporal and left pre-frontal areas. Similarly, ViT 
      highlighted the lateral ventricles associated with cognitive decline, indicating 
      their potential in the Prodromal stage. These findings underscore the potential 
      of these regions as early-stage PD biomarkers and showcase the proposed 
      framework's efficacy in predicting subtypes of PD and aiding in early diagnosis, 
      paving the way for innovative diagnostic tools and precision medicine.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a neurological disease 
      associated with various and heterogeneous clinical characteristics. Given its 
      complex nature and its unpredictable evolution over time, there isn't an 
      established and exhaustive clinical protocol (or tool) for its diagnosis nor for 
      monitoring its progression. Instead, different clinical exams and 
      physical/psychological evaluations need to be taken into account. The Expanded 
      Disability Status Scale (EDSS) is the most used clinical scale, but it suffers 
      from several limitations. Developing computational solutions for the 
      identification of bio-markers of disease progression that overcome the downsides 
      of currently used scales is crucial and is gaining interest in current literature 
      and research. METHODS: This Review focuses on the importance of approaching MS 
      diagnosis and monitoring by investigating correlations between cognitive 
      impairment and clinical data that refer to different MS domains. We review papers 
      that integrate heterogeneous data and analyse them with statistical methods to 
      understand their applicability into more advanced computational tools. Particular 
      attention is paid to the impact that computational approaches can have on 
      personalized-medicine. RESULTS: Personalized medicine for neuro-degenerative 
      diseases is an unmet clinical need which can be addressed using computational 
      approaches able to efficiently integrate heterogeneous clinical data extracted 
      from both private and publicly available electronic health databases. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Reliable and explainable Artificial Intelligence are computational 
      approaches required to understand the complex and demonstrated interactions 
      between MS manifestations as well as to provide reliable predictions on the 
      disease evolution, representing a promising research field.

TI  - Advances in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Precision Medicine 
      in Necrotizing Enterocolitis and Neonatal Sepsis: A State-of-the-Art Review.
LID - 10.3390/children12040498 [doi]
LID - 498
AB  - Necrotizing enterocolitis remains one of the most severe gastrointestinal 
      diseases in neonates, particularly affecting preterm infants. It is characterized 
      by intestinal inflammation and necrosis, with significant morbidity and mortality 
      despite advancements in neonatal care. Recent advancements in artificial 
      intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have shown potential in improving NEC 
      prediction, early diagnosis, and management. A systematic search was conducted 
      across multiple databases to explore the application of AI and ML in predicting 
      NEC risk, diagnosing the condition at early stages, and optimizing treatment 
      strategies.AI-based models demonstrated enhanced accuracy in NEC risk 
      stratification compared to traditional clinical approaches. Machine learning 
      algorithms identified novel biomarkers associated with disease onset and 
      severity. Additionally, deep learning applied to medical imaging improved NEC 
      diagnosis by detecting abnormalities earlier than conventional methods. The 
      integration of AI and ML in NEC research provides promising insights into 
      patient-specific risk assessment. However, challenges such as data heterogeneity, 
      model interpretability, and the need for large-scale validation studies remain. 
      Future research should focus on translating AI-driven findings into clinical 
      practice, ensuring ethical considerations and regulatory compliance.

      cancer biomarker identification.
PG  - 1348974
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2024.1348974 [doi]
LID - 1348974
AB  - BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a type of tumor caused by the uncontrolled 
      growth of cells in the mucosa lining the last part of the intestine. Emerging 
      evidence underscores an association between CRC and gut microbiome dysbiosis. The 
      high mortality rate of this cancer has made it necessary to develop new early 
      diagnostic methods. Machine learning (ML) techniques can represent a solution to 
      evaluate the interaction between intestinal microbiota and host physiology. 
      Through explained artificial intelligence (XAI) it is possible to evaluate the 
      individual contributions of microbial taxonomic markers for each subject. Our 
      work also implements the Shapley Method Additive Explanations (SHAP) algorithm to 
      identify for each subject which parameters are important in the context of CRC. 
      RESULTS: The proposed study aimed to implement an explainable artificial 
      intelligence framework using both gut microbiota data and demographic information 
      from subjects to classify a cohort of control subjects from those with CRC. Our 
      analysis revealed an association between gut microbiota and this disease. We 
      compared three machine learning algorithms, and the Random Forest (RF) algorithm 
      emerged as the best classifier, with a precision of 0.729 ± 0.038 and an area 
      under the Precision-Recall curve of 0.668 ± 0.016. Additionally, SHAP analysis 
      highlighted the most crucial variables in the model's decision-making, 
      facilitating the identification of specific bacteria linked to CRC. Our results 
      confirmed the role of certain bacteria, such as Fusobacterium, 
      Peptostreptococcus, and Parvimonas, whose abundance appears notably associated 
      with the disease, as well as bacteria whose presence is linked to a non-diseased 
      state. DISCUSSION: These findings emphasizes the potential of leveraging gut 
      microbiota data within an explainable AI framework for CRC classification. The 
      significant association observed aligns with existing knowledge. The precision 
      exhibited by the RF algorithm reinforces its suitability for such classification 
      tasks. The SHAP analysis not only enhanced interpretability but identified 
      specific bacteria crucial in CRC determination. This approach opens avenues for 
      targeted interventions based on microbial signatures. Further exploration is 
      warranted to deepen our understanding of the intricate interplay between 
      microbiota and health, providing insights for refined diagnostic and therapeutic 
      strategies.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Endometrial carcinosarcoma is a rare, aggressive high-grade 
      endometrial cancer, accounting for about 5% of all uterine cancers and 15% of 
      deaths from uterine cancers. The treatment can be complex, and the prognosis is 
      poor. Its increasing incidence underscores the urgent requirement for 
      personalized approaches in managing such challenging diseases. METHOD: In this 
      work, we designed an explainable machine learning approach to predict 
      recurrence-free survival in patients affected by endometrial carcinosarcoma. For 
      this purpose, we exploited the predictive power of clinical and histopathological 
      data, as well as chemotherapy and surgical information collected for a cohort of 
      80 patients monitored over time. Among these patients, 32.5% have experienced the 
      appearance of a recurrence. RESULTS: The designed model was able to well describe 
      the observed sequence of events, providing a reliable ranking of the survival 
      times based on the individual risk scores, and achieving a C-index equals to 
      70.00% (95% CI, 59.38-84.74). CONCLUSION: Accordingly, machine learning methods 
      could support clinicians in discriminating between endometrial carcinosarcoma 
      patients at low-risk or high-risk of recurrence, in a non-invasive and 
      inexpensive way. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study proposing 
      a preliminary approach addressing this task.

AB  - Cancer continues to be a significant international health issue, which demands 
      the invention of new methods for early detection, precise diagnoses, and 
      personalized treatments. Artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly become a 
      groundbreaking component in the modern era of oncology, offering sophisticated 
      tools across the range of cancer care. In this review, we performed a systematic 
      survey of the current status of AI technologies used for cancer diagnoses and 
      therapeutic approaches. We discuss AI-facilitated imaging diagnostics using a 
      range of modalities such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, 
      positron emission tomography, ultrasound, and digital pathology, highlighting the 
      growing role of deep learning in detecting early-stage cancers. We also explore 
      applications of AI in genomics and biomarker discovery, liquid biopsies, and 
      non-invasive diagnoses. In therapeutic interventions, AI-based clinical decision 
      support systems, individualized treatment planning, and AI-facilitated drug 
      discovery are transforming precision cancer therapies. The review also evaluates 
      the effects of AI on radiation therapy, robotic surgery, and patient management, 
      including survival predictions, remote monitoring, and AI-facilitated clinical 
      trials. Finally, we discuss important challenges such as data privacy, 
      interpretability, and regulatory issues, and recommend future directions that 
      involve the use of federated learning, synthetic biology, and quantum-boosted AI. 
      This review highlights the groundbreaking potential of AI to revolutionize cancer 
      care by making diagnostics, treatments, and patient management more precise, 
      efficient, and personalized.

TI  - Comparing Artificial Intelligence-Generated and Clinician-Created Personalized 
      Self-Management Guidance for Patients With Knee Osteoarthritis: Blinded 
      Observational Study.
PG  - e67830
LID - 10.2196/67830 [doi]
LID - e67830
AB  - BACKGROUND: Knee osteoarthritis is a prevalent, chronic musculoskeletal disorder 
      that impairs mobility and quality of life. Personalized patient education aims to 
      improve self-management and adherence; yet, its delivery is often limited by time 
      constraints, clinician workload, and the heterogeneity of patient needs. Recent 
      advances in large language models offer potential solutions. GPT-4 (OpenAI), 
      distinguished by its long-context reasoning and adoption in clinical artificial 
      intelligence research, emerged as a leading candidate for personalized health 
      communication. However, its application in generating condition-specific 
      educational guidance remains underexplored, and concerns about misinformation, 
      personalization limits, and ethical oversight remain. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated 
      GPT-4's ability to generate individualized self-management guidance for patients 
      with knee osteoarthritis in comparison with clinician-created content. METHODS: 
      This 2-phase, double-blind, observational study used data from 50 patients 
      previously enrolled in a registered randomized trial. In phase 1, 2 orthopedic 
      clinicians each generated personalized education materials for 25 patient 
      profiles using anonymized clinical data, including history, symptoms, and 
      lifestyle. In phase 2, the same datasets were processed by GPT-4 using 
      standardized prompts. All content was anonymized and evaluated by 2 independent, 
      blinded clinical experts using validated scoring systems. Evaluation criteria 
      included efficiency, readability (Flesch-Kincaid, Gunning Fog, Coleman-Liau, and 
      Simple Measure of Gobbledygook), accuracy, personalization, and comprehensiveness 
      and safety. Disagreements between reviewers were resolved through consensus or 
      third-party adjudication. RESULTS: GPT-4 outperformed clinicians in content 
      generation speed (530.03 vs 37.29 words per min, P<.001). Readability was better 
      on the Flesch-Kincaid (mean 11.56, SD 1.08 vs mean 12.67 SD 0.95), Gunning Fog 
      (mean 12.47, SD 1.36 vs mean 14.56, SD 0.93), and Simple Measure of Gobbledygook 
      (mean 13.33, SD 1.00 vs mean 13.81 SD 0.69) indices (all P<.001), though GPT-4 
      scored slightly higher on the Coleman-Liau Index (mean 15.90, SD 1.03 vs mean 
      15.15, SD 0.91). GPT-4 also outperformed clinicians in accuracy (mean 5.31, SD 
      1.73 vs mean 4.76, SD 1.10; P=.05, personalization (mean 54.32, SD 6.21 vs mean 
      33.20, SD 5.40; P<.001), comprehensiveness (mean 51.74, SD 6.47 vs mean 35.26, SD 
      6.66; P<.001), and safety (median 61, IQR 58-66 vs median 50, IQR 47-55.25; 
      P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: GPT-4 could generate personalized self-management guidance 
      for knee osteoarthritis with greater efficiency, accuracy, personalization, 
      comprehensiveness, and safety than clinician-generated content, as assessed using 
      standardized, guideline-aligned evaluation frameworks. These findings underscore 
      the potential of large language models to support scalable, high-quality patient 
      education in chronic disease management. The observed lexical complexity suggests 
      the need to refine outputs for populations with limited health literacy. As an 
      exploratory, single-center study, these results warrant confirmation in larger, 
      multicenter cohorts with diverse demographic profiles. Future implementation 
      should be guided by ethical and operational safeguards, including data privacy, 
      transparency, and the delineation of clinical responsibility. Hybrid models 
      integrating artificial intelligence-generated content with clinician oversight 
      may offer a pragmatic path forward.

TI  - Development and Validation of an Explainable Machine Learning-Based Prediction 
      Model for Drug-Food Interactions from Chemical Structures.
LID - 10.3390/s23083962 [doi]
LID - 3962
AB  - Possible drug-food constituent interactions (DFIs) could change the intended 
      efficiency of particular therapeutics in medical practice. The increasing number 
      of multiple-drug prescriptions leads to the rise of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) 
      and DFIs. These adverse interactions lead to other implications, e.g., the 
      decline in medicament's effect, the withdrawals of various medications, and 
      harmful impacts on the patients' health. However, the importance of DFIs remains 
      underestimated, as the number of studies on these topics is constrained. 
      Recently, scientists have applied artificial intelligence-based models to study 
      DFIs. However, there were still some limitations in data mining, input, and 
      detailed annotations. This study proposed a novel prediction model to address the 
      limitations of previous studies. In detail, we extracted 70,477 food compounds 
      from the FooDB database and 13,580 drugs from the DrugBank database. We extracted 
      3780 features from each drug-food compound pair. The optimal model was eXtreme 
      Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). We also validated the performance of our model on 
      one external test set from a previous study which contained 1922 DFIs. Finally, 
      we applied our model to recommend whether a drug should or should not be taken 
      with some food compounds based on their interactions. The model can provide 
      highly accurate and clinically relevant recommendations, especially for DFIs that 
      may cause severe adverse events and even death. Our proposed model can contribute 
      to developing more robust predictive models to help patients, under the 
      supervision and consultants of physicians, avoid DFI adverse effects in combining 
      drugs and foods for therapy.

LID - 1828
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming pediatric oncology by 
      creating new means to improve the accuracy and efficacy of cancer diagnosis and 
      treatment in children. This review critically examines current applications of AI 
      technologies like machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) to the main types 
      of pediatric cancers. However, the application of AI to pediatric oncology is 
      prone to certain challenges, including the heterogeneity and rarity of pediatric 
      cancer data, rapid technological development in imaging, and ethical concerns 
      pertaining to data privacy and algorithmic transparency. Collaborative efforts 
      and data-sharing schemes are important to surpass these challenges and facilitate 
      effective training of AI models. This review also points to emerging trends, 
      including AI-based radiomics and proteomics applications, and provides future 
      directions to realize the full potential of AI in pediatric oncology. Finally, AI 
      is a promising paradigm shift toward precision medicine in childhood cancer 
      treatment, which can enhance the survival rates and quality of life for pediatric 
      patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Early-phase clinical trials of protein arginine methyltransferase 5 
      (PRMT5) inhibitors as synthetic lethal strategies have shown promising efficacy 
      in methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP)-deleted tumors. To refine and expand 
      this promising therapeutic approach within the framework of precision oncology, 
      it is critical to comprehensively characterize the clinical and molecular 
      profiles of MTAP-deleted tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This pan-cancer 
      retrospective cohort study analyzed clinico-genomic data from the Center for 
      Cancer Genomics and Advanced Therapeutics (C-CAT) database, which includes 99.7% 
      of patients who underwent comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) in Japan between 
      June 2019 and November 2023. Machine learning and explainable artificial 
      intelligence methods were applied to identify clinical predictors of MTAP 
      deficiency. Findings were validated and compared using The Cancer Genome Atlas 
      (TCGA) and American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Genomics Evidence 
      Neoplasia Information Exchange (GENIE) datasets. RESULTS: Among 51 828 pan-cancer 
      patients in the C-CAT cohort, MTAP deletion was observed in 4964 cases (9.6%), 
      with a high prevalence in pancreatic (18.4%), biliary tract (15.6%), and lung 
      (14.3%) cancers. MTAP deletion was associated with distinct clinical features, 
      including male sex (56.0% versus 47.8%), older age (mean 62.4 versus 59.8 years), 
      and shorter interval from diagnosis to CGP (median 380.0 versus 567.0 days). In 
      pancreatic cancer, MTAP deletion was more common in KRAS-mutant tumors (19.8%) 
      compared with KRAS wild-type tumors (8.9%). Across cancer types, MTAP deletion 
      was less frequent in RB1-mutant tumors (pan-cancer: 3.2%, pancreatic: 7.6%, lung: 
      2.5%, biliary tract: 5.4%) than in RB1 wild-type tumors (9.9%, 18.7%, 16.1%, 
      16.0%). These findings were validated using the TCGA (n = 9896) and GENIE (n = 
      178 034) datasets. In lung adenocarcinoma, MTAP deletion was found in 22.8% of 
      EGFR-mutated tumors, 25.0% of ALK-translocated tumors, and 20.8% of 
      ROS1-translocated tumors. CONCLUSIONS: MTAP deletion is associated with unique 
      clinical and molecular features. These findings define the characteristics of 
      MTAP-deleted cancers and provide a basis for synthetic lethal strategies in 
      precision oncology.

AB  - Autoimmune disorders (AID) present significant challenges due to their complex 
      etiologies and diverse clinical manifestations. Traditional diagnostic methods, 
      which rely on symptom observation and biomarker detection, often lack specificity 
      and fail to provide personalized treatment options. This study proposes 
      ImmunoNet, a deep learning-based framework that integrates genetic, molecular, 
      and clinical data to enhance the accuracy of autoimmune disease diagnosis and 
      treatment. ImmunoNet leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and 
      multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to analyze large-scale datasets, enabling precise 
      disease classification and personalized therapeutic treatment recommendations. 
      The model improves interpretability through explainable AI techniques and 
      enhances privacy via federated learning. Comparative evaluations demonstrate that 
      ImmunoNet outperforms traditional machine learning models, achieving a 98% 
      accuracy rate in predicting autoimmune disorders. By advancing precision medicine 
      in immunology, this approach provides clinicians with a powerful tool for 
      personalized diagnosis and optimized therapeutic strategies.

TI  - Bayesian Approaches in Exploring Gene-environment and Gene-gene Interactions: A 
      Comprehensive Review.
PG  - 669-678
LID - 10.21873/cgp.20414 [doi]
AB  - Rapid advancements in high-throughput biological techniques have facilitated the 
      generation of high-dimensional omics datasets, which have provided a solid 
      foundation for precision medicine and prognosis prediction. Nonetheless, the 
      problem of missing heritability persists. To solve this problem, it is essential 
      to explain the genetic structure of disease incidence risk and prognosis by 
      incorporating interactions. The development of the Bayesian theory has provided 
      new approaches for developing models for interaction identification and 
      estimation. Several Bayesian models have been developed to improve the accuracy 
      of model and identify the main effect, gene-environment (G×E) and gene-gene (G×G) 
      interactions. Studies based on single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are 
      significant for the exploration of rare and common variants. Models based on the 
      effect heredity principle and group-based models are relatively flexible and do 
      not require strict constraints when dealing with the hierarchical structure 
      between the main effect and interactions (M-I). These models have a good 
      interpretability of biological mechanisms. Machine learning-based Bayesian 
      approaches are highly competitive in improving prediction accuracy. These models 
      provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the occurrence and progression of 
      complex diseases, identify more reliable biomarkers, and develop higher 
      predictive accuracy. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of these 
      Bayesian approaches.

TI  - AI Applications in Transfusion Medicine: Opportunities, Challenges, and Future 
      Directions.
PG  - 1-11
LID - 10.1159/000546303 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping healthcare, with its 
      applications in transfusion medicine (TM) showing great promise to address 
      longstanding challenges. SUMMARY: This review explores the integration of 
      AI-driven tools, including machine learning, deep learning, natural language 
      processing, and predictive analytics, across various domains of TM. From 
      enhancing donor management and optimizing blood product quality to predicting 
      transfusion needs and assessing bleeding risks, AI has demonstrated its potential 
      to improve operational efficiency, patient safety, and resource allocation. 
      Additionally, AI-powered systems enable more accurate blood antigen phenotyping, 
      automate hemovigilance workflows, and streamline inventory management through 
      advanced forecasting models. While these advancements are largely exploratory, 
      early studies highlight the growing importance of AI in improving patient 
      outcomes and advancing precision medicine. However, challenges such as 
      variability in clinical workflows, algorithmic transparency, equitable access, 
      and ethical concerns around data privacy and bias must be addressed to ensure 
      responsible integration. KEY MESSAGES: (i) AI-driven tools are being applied 
      across multiple domains of TM. (ii) Early studies demonstrate the potential for 
      AI to improve efficiency, safety, and personalization. (iii) Key implementation 
      challenges include data privacy, workflow integration, and equitable access.

TI  - The Promise of Explainable AI in Digital Health for Precision Medicine: A 
      Systematic Review.
LID - 10.3390/jpm14030277 [doi]
LID - 277
AB  - This review synthesizes the literature on explaining machine-learning models for 
      digital health data in precision medicine. As healthcare increasingly tailors 
      treatments to individual characteristics, the integration of artificial 
      intelligence with digital health data becomes crucial. Leveraging a 
      topic-modeling approach, this paper distills the key themes of 27 journal 
      articles. We included peer-reviewed journal articles written in English, with no 
      time constraints on the search. A Google Scholar search, conducted up to 19 
      September 2023, yielded 27 journal articles. Through a topic-modeling approach, 
      the identified topics encompassed optimizing patient healthcare through 
      data-driven medicine, predictive modeling with data and algorithms, predicting

TI  - Harnessing Artificial Intelligence in Obesity Research and Management: A 
      Comprehensive Review.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics15030396 [doi]
LID - 396
AB  - Purpose: This review aims to explore the clinical and research applications of 
      artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning (ML) and deep 
      learning (DL), in understanding, predicting, and managing obesity. It assesses 
      the use of AI tools to identify obesity-related risk factors, predict outcomes, 
      personalize treatments, and improve healthcare interventions for obesity. 
      Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed and Google 
      Scholar, with keywords including "artificial intelligence", "machine learning", 
      "deep learning", "obesity", "obesity management", and related terms. Studies 
      focusing on AI's role in obesity research, management, and therapeutic 
      interventions were reviewed, including observational studies, systematic reviews, 
      and clinical applications. Results: This review identifies numerous AI-driven 
      models, such as ML and DL, used in obesity prediction, patient stratification, 
      and personalized management strategies. Applications of AI in obesity research 
      include risk prediction, early detection, and individualization of treatment 
      plans. AI has facilitated the development of predictive models utilizing various 
      data sources, such as genetic, epigenetic, and clinical data. However, AI models 
      vary in effectiveness, influenced by dataset type, research goals, and model 
      interpretability. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and 
      F1-score were evaluated to optimize model selection. Conclusions: AI offers 
      promising advancements in obesity management, enabling more personalized and 
      efficient care. While technology presents considerable potential, challenges such 
      as data quality, ethical considerations, and technical requirements remain. 
      Addressing these will be essential to fully harness AI's potential in obesity 
      research and treatment, supporting a shift toward precision healthcare.

TI  - eXplainable AI Allows Predicting Upper Limb Rehabilitation Outcomes in Sub-Acute 
      Stroke Patients.
PG  - 263-273
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2022.3220179 [doi]
AB  - While stroke is one of the leading causes of disability, the prediction of upper 
      limb (UL) functional recovery following rehabilitation is still unsatisfactory, 
      hampered by the clinical complexity of post-stroke impairment. Predictive models 
      leading to accurate estimates while revealing which features contribute most to 
      the predictions are the key to unveil the mechanisms subserving the 
      post-intervention recovery, prompting a new focus on individualized treatments 
      and precision medicine in stroke. Machine learning (ML) and explainable 
      artificial intelligence (XAI) are emerging as the enabling technology in 
      different fields, being promising tools also in clinics. In this study, we had 
      the twofold goal of evaluating whether ML can allow deriving accurate predictions 
      of UL recovery in sub-acute patients, and disentangling the contribution of the 
      variables shaping the outcomes. To do so, Random Forest equipped with four XAI 
      methods was applied to interpret the results and assess the feature relevance and 
      their consensus. Our results revealed increased performance when using ML 
      compared to conventional statistical approaches. Moreover, the features deemed as 
      the most relevant were concordant across the XAI methods, suggesting good 
      stability of the results. In particular, the baseline motor impairment as 
      measured by simple clinical scales had the largest impact, as expected. Our 
      findings highlight the core role of ML not only for accurately predicting the 
      individual outcome scores after rehabilitation, but also for making ML results 
      interpretable when associated to XAI methods. This provides clinicians with 
      robust predictions and reliable explanations that are key factors in therapeutic 
      planning/monitoring of stroke patients.

TI  - Interpretable genotype-to-phenotype classifiers with performance guarantees.
PG  - 4071

LID - 4071
AB  - Understanding the relationship between the genome of a cell and its phenotype is 
      a central problem in precision medicine. Nonetheless, genotype-to-phenotype 
      prediction comes with great challenges for machine learning algorithms that limit 
      their use in this setting. The high dimensionality of the data tends to hinder 
      generalization and challenges the scalability of most learning algorithms. 
      Additionally, most algorithms produce models that are complex and difficult to 
      interpret. We alleviate these limitations by proposing strong performance 
      guarantees, based on sample compression theory, for rule-based learning 
      algorithms that produce highly interpretable models. We show that these 
      guarantees can be leveraged to accelerate learning and improve model 
      interpretability. Our approach is validated through an application to the genomic 
      prediction of antimicrobial resistance, an important public health concern. 
      Highly accurate models were obtained for 12 species and 56 antibiotics, and their 
      interpretation revealed known resistance mechanisms, as well as some potentially 
      new ones. An open-source disk-based implementation that is both memory and 
      computationally efficient is provided with this work. The implementation is 
      turnkey, requires no prior knowledge of machine learning, and is complemented by 
      comprehensive tutorials.

      molecular imaging as it will in everyday life. In this review, we focus on the 
      potential applications of AI in the field, both from a physical (radiomics, 
      underlying statistics, image reconstruction and data analysis) and a clinical 
      (neurology, cardiology, oncology) perspective. Challenges for transferability 
      from research to clinical practice are being discussed as is the concept of 
      explainable AI. Finally, we focus on the fields where challenges should be set 
      out to introduce AI in the field of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging in a 
      reliable manner.

AB  - Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive subtype of breast 
      cancer (BC) characterized by the absence of estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 
      receptors, resulting in limited therapeutic options. This article critically 
      examines the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in enhancing the diagnosis and 
      treatment of TNBC treatment. We begin by discussing the incidence of TNBC and the

AB  - Colorectal cancer remains a major health concern, with colorectal polyps as key 
      precursors. Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is a common treatment, but 
      recurrence rates remain high. Traditional surveillance strategies rely on polyp 
      characteristics and completeness of the resection potentially missing key risk 
      factors. Machine learning (ML) offers a transformative approach by integrating 
      patient-specific data to refine risk stratification. Recent studies highlight ML 
      models, such as Extreme Gradient Boosting, which outperform conventional methods 
      in predicting polyp recurrence within one-year post-EMR. These models incorporate 
      factors like age, smoking status, family history, and pathology, optimizing 
      follow-up recommendations and minimizing unnecessary procedures. Artificial 
      intelligence (AI)-driven tools and web-based calculators enhance clinical 
      workflow by providing real-time, personalized risk assessments. However, 
      challenges remain in external validation, model interpretability, and clinical 
      integration. Future surveillance strategies should combine expert judgment with 
      AI insights to optimize patient outcomes. As gastroenterology embraces AI, 
      ML-driven surveillance represents a paradigm shift, advancing precision medicine 
      in colorectal polyp management. This editorial explores AI's role in transforming 
      post-EMR follow-up, addressing benefits, limitations, and future directions.

AB  - DNA methylation is a fundamental epigenetic modification that regulates gene 
      expression and maintains genomic stability. Consequently, DNA methylation remains 
      a key biomarker in cancer research, playing a vital role in diagnosis, prognosis, 
      and tailored treatment strategies. Aberrant methylation patterns enable early 
      cancer detection and therapeutic stratification; however, their complex patterns 
      necessitates advanced analytical tools. Recent advances in artificial 
      intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), including deep learning networks and 
      graph-based models, have revolutionized cancer epigenomics by enabling rapid, 
      high-resolution analysis of DNA methylation profiles. Moreover, these 
      technologies are accelerating the development of Multi-Cancer Early Detection 
      (MCED) tests, such as GRAIL's Galleri and CancerSEEK, which improve diagnostic 
      accuracy across diverse cancer types. In this review, we explore the synergy 
      between AI and DNA methylation profiling to advance precision oncology. We first 
      examine the role of DNA methylation as a biomarker in cancer, followed by an 
      overview of DNA profiling technologies. We then assess how AI-driven approaches 
      transform clinical practice by enabling early detection and accurate 
      classification. Despite their promise, challenges remain, including limited 
      sensitivity for early-stage cancers, the black-box nature of many AI algorithms, 
      and the need for validation across diverse populations to ensure equitable 
      implementation. Future directions include integrating multi-omics data, 
      developing explainable AI frameworks, and addressing ethical concerns, such as 
      data privacy and algorithmic bias. By overcoming these gaps, AI-powered 
      epigenetic diagnostics can enable earlier detection, more effective treatments, 
      and improved patient outcomes, globally. In summary, this review synthesizes 
      current advancements in the field and envisions a future where AI and epigenomics 
      converge to redefine cancer diagnostics and therapy.

TI  - A novel approach for personalized response model: deep learning with individual 
      dropout feature ranking.
PG  - 165-179
LID - 10.1007/s10928-020-09724-x [doi]
AB  - Deep learning is the fastest growing field in artificial intelligence and has led 
      to many transformative innovations in various domains. However, lack of 
      interpretability sometimes hinders its application in hypothesis-driven domains 
      such as biology and healthcare. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning 
      model with individual feature ranking. Several simulated datasets with the 
      scenarios that contributing features are correlated and buried among 
      non-contributing features were used to characterize the novel analysis approach. 
      A publicly available clinical dataset was also applied. The performance of the 
      individual level dropout feature ranking model was compared with commonly used 
      artificial neural network model, random forest model, and population level 
      dropout feature ranking model. The individual level dropout feature ranking model 
      provides a reasonable prediction of the outcomes. Unlike the random forest model 
      and population level dropout feature ranking model, which can only identify 
      global-wise contributing features (i.e., at population level), the individual 
      level dropout feature ranking model allows further identification of impactful 
      features on response at individual level. Therefore, it provides a basis for 
      clustering patients into subgroups. This may provide a new tool for enriching 
      patients in clinical drug development and developing personalized or 
      individualized medicine.

TI  - SeizFt: Interpretable Machine Learning for Seizure Detection Using Wearables.
LID - 10.3390/bioengineering10080918 [doi]
LID - 918
AB  - This work presents SeizFt-a novel seizure detection framework that utilizes 
      machine learning to automatically detect seizures using wearable SensorDot EEG 
      data. Inspired by interpretable sleep staging, our novel approach employs a 
      unique combination of data augmentation, meaningful feature extraction, and an 
      ensemble of decision trees to improve resilience to variations in EEG and to 
      increase the capacity to generalize to unseen data. Fourier Transform (FT) 
      Surrogates were utilized to increase sample size and improve the class balance 
      between labeled non-seizure and seizure epochs. To enhance model stability and 
      accuracy, SeizFt utilizes an ensemble of decision trees through the CatBoost 
      classifier to classify each second of EEG recording as seizure or non-seizure. 
      The SeizIt1 dataset was used for training, and the SeizIt2 dataset for validation 
      and testing. Model performance for seizure detection was evaluated using two 
      primary metrics: sensitivity using the any-overlap method (OVLP) and False Alarm 
      (FA) rate using epoch-based scoring (EPOCH). Notably, SeizFt placed first among 
      an array of state-of-the-art seizure detection algorithms as part of the Seizure 
      Detection Grand Challenge at the 2023 International Conference on Acoustics, 
      Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP). SeizFt outperformed state-of-the-art 
      black-box models in accurate seizure detection and minimized false alarms, 
      obtaining a total score of 40.15, combining OVLP and EPOCH across two tasks and 
      representing an improvement of ~30% from the next best approach. The 
      interpretability of SeizFt is a key advantage, as it fosters trust and 
      accountability among healthcare professionals. The most predictive seizure 
      detection features extracted from SeizFt were: delta wave, interquartile range, 
      standard deviation, total absolute power, theta wave, the ratio of delta to 
      theta, binned entropy, Hjorth complexity, delta + theta, and Higuchi fractal 
      dimension. In conclusion, the successful application of SeizFt to wearable 
      SensorDot data suggests its potential for real-time, continuous monitoring to 
      improve personalized medicine for epilepsy.

AB  - This report synthesizes the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck 
      Surgery (AAO-HNS) Task Force's guidance on the integration of artificial 
      intelligence (AI) in otolaryngology-head and neck surgery (OHNS). A comprehensive 
      literature review was conducted, focusing on the applications, benefits, and 
      challenges of AI in OHNS, alongside ethical, legal, and social implications. The 
      Task Force, formulated by otolaryngologist experts in AI, used an iterative 
      approach, adapted from the Delphi method, to prioritize topics for inclusion and 
      to reach a consensus on guiding principles. The Task Force's findings highlight 
      AI's transformative potential for OHNS, offering potential advancements in 
      precision medicine, clinical decision support, operational efficiency, research, 
      and education. However, challenges such as data quality, health equity, privacy 
      concerns, transparency, regulatory gaps, and ethical dilemmas necessitate careful 
      navigation. Incorporating AI into otolaryngology practice in a safe, equitable, 
      and patient-centered manner requires clinician judgment, transparent AI systems, 
      and adherence to ethical and legal standards. The Task Force principles 
      underscore the importance of otolaryngologists' involvement in AI's ethical 
      development, implementation, and regulation to harness benefits while mitigating 
      risks. The proposed principles inform the integration of AI in otolaryngology, 
      aiming to enhance patient outcomes, clinician well-being, and efficiency of 
      health care delivery.

PG  - 9-17
LID - 10.1007/s11899-023-00716-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: This review aims to elucidate the transformative impact 
      and potential of machine learning (ML) in the diagnosis, prognosis, and clinical 
      management of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). 
      It further aims to bridge the gap between current advances of ML and their 
      practical application in these diseases. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent advances in ML 
      have revolutionized prognostication, diagnosis, and treatment of MDS and AML. ML 
      algorithms have proven effective in predicting disease progression, optimizing 
      treatment responses, and in the stratification of patient groups. Particularly, 
      the use of ML in genomic and epigenomic data analysis has unveiled novel insights 
      into the molecular heterogeneity of MDS and AML, leading to better-informed 
      therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, deep learning techniques have shown promise 
      in analyzing complex patterns in bone marrow biopsy images, providing a potential 
      pathway towards early and accurate diagnosis. While still in the nascent stages, 
      ML applications in MDS and AML signify a paradigm shift towards precision 
      medicine. The integration of ML with traditional clinical practices could 
      potentially enhance diagnostic accuracy, refine risk stratification, and improve 
      therapeutic approaches. However, challenges related to data privacy, 
      standardization, and algorithm interpretability must be addressed to realize the 
      full potential of ML in this field. Future research should focus on the 
      development of robust, transparent ML models and their ethical implementation in 
      clinical settings.

AB  - Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) utilizes multi-metabolite and multi-target 
      interventions to address complex diseases, providing advantages over 
      single-target therapies. However, the active metabolites, therapeutic targets, 
      and especially the combination mechanisms remain unclear. The integration of 
      advanced data analysis and nonlinear modeling capabilities of artificial 
      intelligence (AI) is driving the transformation of TCM into precision medicine. 
      This review concentrates on the application of AI in TCM target prediction, 
      including multi-omics techniques, TCM-specialized databases, machine learning 
      (ML), deep learning (DL), and cross-modal fusion strategies. It also critically 
      analyzes persistent challenges such as data heterogeneity, limited model 
      interpretability, causal confounding, and insufficient robustness validation in 
      practical applications. To enhance the reliability and scalability of AI in TCM 
      target prediction, future research should prioritize continuous optimization of 
      the AI algorithms using zero-shot learning, end-to-end architectures, and 
      self-supervised contrastive learning.

LID - 10.1159/000547180 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, 
      affects millions globally, with cognitive impairment as a significant non-motor 
      complication. These cognitive changes, ranging from mild cognitive impairment to 
      severe dementia, drastically reduce quality of life and worsen prognosis. Early 
      and accurate detection is critical for effective management and therapeutic 
      interventions. SUMMARY: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) offer 
      novel solutions for diagnosing, predicting, and managing cognitive deficits in PD 
      by integrating diverse data modalities, including neuroimaging, 
      electrophysiology, kinetic markers, and laboratory biomarkers. Prominent AI 
      techniques, such as support vector machines, random forests, and convolutional 
      neural networks, have demonstrated high accuracy in analyzing multimodal data for 
      cognitive profile prediction. Additionally, AI supports the development of 
      personalized treatment strategies, both pharmacological and non-pharmacological, 
      and enhances accessibility through telemedicine initiatives. Despite these 
      advancements, challenges persist in standardizing methodologies, improving model 
      interpretability, and integrating AI tools into clinical practice. Overcoming 
      these hurdles will require robust validation studies and multidisciplinary 
      collaboration. KEY MESSAGES: This review examines the transformative role of AI 
      in analyzing multimodal datasets to classify cognitive impairments, predict 
      disease progression, and identify therapeutic targets, paving the way for 
      personalized, patient-centered care in PD management.

TI  - Use of Artificial Intelligence in Current Fight Against Antimicrobial Resistance.
LID - 10.1089/mdr.2024.0241 [doi]
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a significant global health threat, with 
      projections indicating it could surpass cancer in mortality rates by 2050 if left 
      unaddressed. Optimizing antimicrobial dosing is critical to mitigate resistance 
      and improve clinical outcomes. Traditional approaches, including population 
      pharmacokinetics (PK) models and Bayesian estimation, are limited by mechanistic 
      hypothesis requirements and complexity. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine 
      learning (ML) offer transformative solutions by leveraging large datasets to 
      predict drug exposure accurately, refine sampling strategies, and enable 
      real-time dose adjustments through therapeutic drug monitoring. This review 
      highlights the role of ML models, in managing PK and pharmacodynamic variability 
      across diverse patient populations. AI models often equal or outperform 
      traditional methods in achieving therapeutic targets while minimizing toxicity, 
      as demonstrated in some case studies involving ganciclovir, vancomycin, and 
      daptomycin. Despite challenges such as data quality, interpretability, and 
      integration with clinical workflows, AI's dynamic adaptability and precision 
      underscore its potential. Future directions emphasize integrating multi-omics 
      data, developing bedside decision-support tools, and expanding AI applications to 
      broader drug categories and populations. Continued research and clinical 
      validation are essential to harness AI's full potential in advancing precision 
      medicine and combating AMR effectively.

TI  - MuTATE-an R package for comprehensive multi-objective molecular modeling.
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btad507 [doi]
LID - btad507
AB  - MOTIVATION: Comprehensive multi-omics studies have driven advances in disease 
      modeling for effective precision medicine but pose a challenge for existing 
      machine-learning approaches, which have limited interpretability across clinical 
      endpoints. Automated, comprehensive disease modeling requires a machine-learning 
      approach that can simultaneously identify disease subgroups and their defining 
      molecular biomarkers by explaining multiple clinical endpoints. Current tools are 
      restricted to individual endpoints or limited variable types, necessitate 
      advanced computation skills, and require resource-intensive manual expert 
      interpretation. RESULTS: We developed Multi-Target Automated Tree Engine (MuTATE) 
      for automated and comprehensive molecular modeling, which enables user-friendly 
      multi-objective decision tree construction and visualization of relationships 
      between molecular biomarkers and patient subgroups characterized by multiple 
      clinical endpoints. MuTATE incorporates multiple targets throughout model 
      construction and allows for target weights, enabling construction of 
      interpretable decision trees that provide insights into disease heterogeneity and 
      molecular signatures. MuTATE eliminates the need for manual synthesis of multiple 
      non-explainable models, making it highly efficient and accessible for 
      bioinformaticians and clinicians. The flexibility and versatility of MuTATE make 
      it applicable to a wide range of complex diseases, including cancer, where it can 
      improve therapeutic decisions by providing comprehensive molecular insights for 
      precision medicine. MuTATE has the potential to transform biomarker discovery and 
      subtype identification, leading to more effective and personalized treatment 
      strategies in precision medicine, and advancing our understanding of disease 
      mechanisms at the molecular level. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: MuTATE is 
      freely available at GitHub (https://github.com/SarahAyton/MuTATE) under the GPLv3 
      license.

TI  - Reinforcement Learning in Personalized Medicine: A Comprehensive Review of 
      Treatment Optimization Strategies.
PG  - e82756
LID - 10.7759/cureus.82756 [doi]
LID - e82756
AB  - Reinforcement learning (RL), a subset of artificial intelligence, is gaining 
      momentum in personalized medicine due to its ability to model dynamic, sequential 
      decision-making. Unlike traditional machine learning approaches, RL systems adapt 
      treatment protocols based on patient-specific responses and evolving health 
      states, offering a robust strategy for optimizing individualized care. This 
      review explores the integration of RL into personalized medicine across diverse 
      clinical domains, including oncology, chronic disease management, psychiatry, 
      infectious diseases, and rehabilitation. Applications such as chemotherapy 
      scheduling, insulin dosing, personalized antidepressant treatment, and ICU 
      management illustrate RL's capacity to improve therapeutic outcomes by maximizing 
      long-term clinical benefits. Key methodological components, including data 
      integration, reward signal engineering, and interpretability challenges, are 
      discussed alongside solutions such as explainable AI tools, surrogate models, and 
      federated learning. Ethical and regulatory considerations are also examined, 
      highlighting issues such as patient consent, algorithmic bias, and evolving 
      guidelines from regulatory bodies like the Food and Drug Administration and the 
      European Medicines Agency. The review emphasizes the importance of 
      interdisciplinary collaboration and clinician engagement for the successful 
      deployment of RL in healthcare settings. RL presents a transformative framework 
      for delivering adaptive, equitable, and patient-centered treatment strategies. 
      Future research should focus on implementing it safely, scalably, and 
      transparently to fully harness its potential.

AB  - The rapid evolution of neural networks and deep learning has revolutionized 
      various fields, with clinical cardiology being no exception. As traditional 
      methods in cardiology encounter limitations, the integration of advanced 
      computational techniques offers unprecedented opportunities in diagnostics and 
      patient care. This review explores the transformative role of neural networks and 
      deep learning in clinical cardiology, particularly focusing on their applications 
      in electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis, imaging technologies, and cardiac prediction 
      models. Among others, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have significantly surpassed 
      traditional approaches in accuracy and efficiency in automatic ECG diagnosis. 
      Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are successfully applied in PET/CT and 
      PET/MR imaging, enhancing diagnostic capabilities. Furthermore, deep learning 
      algorithms have shown potential in improving cardiac prediction models, although 
      challenges in interpretability and clinical integration remain. The review also 
      addresses the 'black box' nature of neural networks and the ethical 
      considerations surrounding their use in clinical settings. Overall, this review 
      underscores the significant impact of neural networks and deep learning in 
      cardiology, providing insights into current applications and future directions in 
      the field.

LID - e67844
AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) remains a leading cause of vision loss worldwide, with 
      early detection critical for preventing irreversible damage. This review explores 
      the current landscape and future directions of artificial intelligence 
      (AI)-enhanced detection of DR from fundus images. Recent advances in deep 
      learning and computer vision have enabled AI systems to analyze retinal images 
      with expert-level accuracy, potentially transforming DR screening. Key 
      developments include convolutional neural networks achieving high sensitivity and 
      specificity in detecting referable DR, multi-task learning approaches that can 
      simultaneously detect and grade DR severity, and lightweight models enabling 
      deployment on mobile devices. While these AI systems show promise in improving 
      the efficiency and accessibility of DR screening, several challenges remain. 
      These include ensuring generalizability across diverse populations, standardizing 
      image acquisition and quality, addressing the "black box" nature of complex 
      models, and integrating AI seamlessly into clinical workflows. Future directions 
      in the field encompass explainable AI to enhance transparency, federated learning 
      to leverage decentralized datasets, and the integration of AI with electronic 
      health records and other diagnostic modalities. There is also growing potential 
      for AI to contribute to personalized treatment planning and predictive analytics 
      for disease progression. As the technology continues to evolve, maintaining a 
      focus on rigorous clinical validation, ethical considerations, and real-world 
      implementation will be crucial for realizing the full potential of AI-enhanced DR 
      detection in improving global eye health outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The occurrence of distant metastases (DM) limits the overall survival 
      (OS) of patients with chondrosarcoma (CS). Early diagnosis and treatment of CS 
      remains a great challenge in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to 
      investigate metastatic factors and develop a risk stratification model for 
      clinicians' decision-making. METHODS: Six machine learning (ML) algorithms, 
      including logistic regression (LR), plain Bayesian classifier (NBC), decision 
      tree (DT), random forest (RF), gradient boosting machine (GBM) and extreme 
      gradient boosting (XGBoost). A 10-fold cross-validation was performed for each 
      model separately, multicenter data was used as external validation, and the best 
      (highest AUC) model was selected to build the network calculator. RESULTS: A 
      total of 1,385 patients met the inclusion criteria, including 82 (5.9%) patients 
      with metastatic CS. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the 
      risk of DM was significantly higher in patients with higher pathologic grades, 
      T-stage, N-stage, and non-left primary lesions, as well as those who did not 
      receive surgery and chemotherapy. The AUC of the six ML algorithms for predicting 
      DM ranged from 0.911-0.985, with the extreme gradient enhancement algorithm 
      (XGBoost) having the highest AUC. Therefore, we used the XGB model and uploaded 
      the results to an online risk calculator for estimating DM risk. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      this study, combined with adequate SEER case database and external validation 
      with data from multicenter institutions in different geographic regions, we 
      confirmed that CS, T, N, laterality, and grading of surgery and chemotherapy were 
      independent risk factors for DM. Based on the easily available clinical risk 
      factors, machine learning algorithms built the XGB model that predicts the best 
      outcome for DM. An online risk calculator helps simplify the patient assessment 
      process and provides decision guidance for precision medicine and long-term 
      cancer surveillance, which contributes to the interpretability of the model.

AB  - Personalized treatment strategies for cancer frequently rely on the detection of 
      genetic alterations which are determined by molecular biology assays. 
      Historically, these processes typically required single-gene sequencing, 
      next-generation sequencing, or visual inspection of histopathology slides by 
      experienced pathologists in a clinical context. In the past decade, advances in 
      artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have demonstrated remarkable potential 
      in assisting physicians with accurate diagnosis of oncology image-recognition 
      tasks. Meanwhile, AI techniques make it possible to integrate multimodal data 
      such as radiology, histology, and genomics, providing critical guidance for the 
      stratification of patients in the context of precision therapy. Given that the 
      mutation detection is unaffordable and time-consuming for a considerable number 
      of patients, predicting gene mutations based on routine clinical radiological 
      scans or whole-slide images of tissue with AI-based methods has become a hot 
      issue in actual clinical practice. In this review, we synthesized the general 
      framework of multimodal integration (MMI) for molecular intelligent diagnostics 
      beyond standard techniques. Then we summarized the emerging applications of AI in 
      the prediction of mutational and molecular profiles of common cancers (lung, 
      brain, breast, and other tumor types) pertaining to radiology and histology 
      imaging. Furthermore, we concluded that there truly exist multiple challenges of 
      AI techniques in the way of its real-world application in the medical field, 
      including data curation, feature fusion, model interpretability, and practice 
      regulations. Despite these challenges, we still prospect the clinical 
      implementation of AI as a highly potential decision-support tool to aid 
      oncologists in future cancer treatment management.

TI  - LLM-PBC: Logic Learning Machine-Based Explainable Rules Accurately Stratify the 
      Genetic Risk of Primary Biliary Cholangitis.
LID - 10.3390/jpm12101587 [doi]
LID - 1587
AB  - BACKGROUND: The application of Machine Learning (ML) to genetic individual-level 
      data represents a foreseeable advancement for the field, which is still in its 
      infancy. Here, we aimed to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of an ML-based 
      model for disease risk prediction applied to Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC). 
      METHODS: Genome-wide significant variants identified in subjects of European 
      ancestry in the recently released second international meta-analysis of GWAS in 
      PBC were used as input data. Quality-checked, individual genomic data from two 
      Italian cohorts were used. The ML included the following steps: import of 
      genotype and phenotype data, genetic variant selection, supervised classification 
      of PBC by genotype, generation of "if-then" rules for disease prediction by logic 
      learning machine (LLM), and model validation in a different cohort. RESULTS: The 
      training cohort included 1345 individuals: 444 were PBC cases and 901 were 
      healthy controls. After pre-processing, 41,899 variants entered the analysis. 
      Several configurations of parameters related to feature selection were simulated. 
      The best LLM model reached an Accuracy of 71.7%, a Matthews correlation 
      coefficient of 0.29, a Youden's value of 0.21, a Sensitivity of 0.28, a 
      Specificity of 0.93, a Positive Predictive Value of 0.66, and a Negative 
      Predictive Value of 0.72. Thirty-eight rules were generated. The rule with the 
      highest covering (19.14) included the following genes: RIN3, KANSL1, TIMMDC1, 
      TNPO3. The validation cohort included 834 individuals: 255 cases and 579 
      controls. By applying the ruleset derived in the training cohort, the Area under 
      the Curve of the model was 0.73. CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the first 
      illustration of an ML model applied to common variants associated with PBC. Our 
      approach is computationally feasible, leverages individual-level data to generate 
      intelligible rules, and can be used for disease prediction in at-risk 
      individuals.

AB  - Understanding of complex biological systems remains a significant challenge due 
      to their high dimensionality, nonlinearity, and context-specific behavior. 
      Artificial intelligence (AI) and mechanistic modeling are becoming essential 
      tools for studying such complex systems. Mechanistic modeling can facilitate the 
      construction of simulatable models that are interpretable but often struggle with 
      scalability and parameters estimation. AI can integrate multi-omics data to 
      create predictive models, but it lacks interpretability. The gap between these 
      two modeling methods limits our ability to develop comprehensive and predictive 
      models for biomedical applications. This article reviews the most recent 
      advancements in the integration of AI and mechanistic modeling to fill this gap. 
      Recently, with omics availability, AI has led to new discoveries in mechanistic 
      computational modeling. The mechanistic models can also help in getting insight 
      into the mechanism for prediction made by AI models. This integration is helpful 
      in modeling complex systems, estimating the parameters that are hard to capture 
      in experiments, and creating surrogate models to reduce computational costs 
      because of expensive mechanistic model simulations. This article focuses on 
      advancements in mechanistic computational models and AI models and their 
      integration for scientific discoveries in biology, pharmacology, drug discovery 
      and diseases. The mechanistic models with AI integration can facilitate 
      biological discoveries to advance our understanding of disease mechanisms, drug 
      development, and personalized medicine. The article also highlights the role of 
      AI and mechanistic model integration in the development of more advanced models 
      in the biomedical domain, such as medical digital twins and virtual patients for 
      pharmacological discoveries.

AB  - Deep learning has emerged as a revolutionary technical advancement in modern 
      orthodontics, offering novel methods for diagnosis, treatment planning, and 
      outcome prediction. Over the past 25 years, the field of dentistry has widely 
      adopted information technology (IT), resulting in several benefits, including 
      decreased expenses, increased efficiency, decreased need for human expertise, and 
      reduced errors. The transition from preset rules to learning from real-world 
      examples, particularly machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), 
      has greatly benefited the organization, analysis, and storage of medical data. 
      Deep learning, a type of AI, enables robots to mimic human neural networks, 
      allowing them to learn and make decisions independently without the need for 
      explicit programming. Its ability to automate cephalometric analysis and enhance 
      diagnosis through 3D imaging has revolutionized orthodontic operations. Deep 
      learning models have the potential to significantly improve treatment outcomes 
      and reduce human errors by accurately identifying anatomical characteristics on 
      radiographs, thereby expediting analytical processes. Additionally, the use of 3D 
      imaging technologies such as cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) can facilitate 
      precise treatment planning, allowing for comprehensive examinations of 
      craniofacial architecture, tooth movements, and airway dimensions. In today's era 
      of personalized medicine, deep learning's ability to customize treatments for 
      individual patients has propelled the field of orthodontics forward tremendously. 
      However, it is essential to address issues related to data privacy, model 
      interpretability, and ethical considerations before orthodontic practices can use 
      deep learning in an ethical and responsible manner. Modern orthodontics is 
      evolving, thanks to the ability of deep learning to deliver more accurate, 
      effective, and personalized orthodontic treatments, improving patient care as 
      technology develops.

TI  - BioM2: biologically informed multi-stage machine learning for phenotype 
      prediction using omics data.
LID - 10.1093/bib/bbae384 [doi]
LID - bbae384
AB  - Navigating the complex landscape of high-dimensional omics data with machine 
      learning models presents a significant challenge. The integration of biological 
      domain knowledge into these models has shown promise in creating more meaningful 
      stratifications of predictor variables, leading to algorithms that are both more 
      accurate and generalizable. However, the wider availability of machine learning 
      tools capable of incorporating such biological knowledge remains limited. 
      Addressing this gap, we introduce BioM2, a novel R package designed for 
      biologically informed multistage machine learning. BioM2 uniquely leverages 
      biological information to effectively stratify and aggregate high-dimensional 
      biological data in the context of machine learning. Demonstrating its utility 
      with genome-wide DNA methylation and transcriptome-wide gene expression data, 
      BioM2 has shown to enhance predictive performance, surpassing traditional machine 
      learning models that operate without the integration of biological knowledge. A 
      key feature of BioM2 is its ability to rank predictor variables within biological 
      categories, specifically Gene Ontology pathways. This functionality not only aids 
      in the interpretability of the results but also enables a subsequent modular 
      network analysis of these variables, shedding light on the intricate 
      systems-level biology underpinning the predictive outcome. We have proposed a 
      biologically informed multistage machine learning framework termed BioM2 for 
      phenotype prediction based on omics data. BioM2 has been incorporated into the 
      BioM2 CRAN package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BioM2/index.html).

TI  - Machine Learning Models for Predicting Gynecological Cancers: Advances, 
      Challenges, and Future Directions.
LID - 10.3390/cancers17172799 [doi]
LID - 2799
AB  - Gynecological cancer, especially breast, cervical, and ovarian cancer, are 
      significant health issues affecting women worldwide. When screened they are 
      mostly detected at later stages because of non-specific signs and symptoms as 
      well as the unavailability of reliable screening methods. The improvement of 
      early oncologic prediction methods is therefore needed to work out the survival 
      rates, guide individualized treatment, and relieve healthcare pressures. Outcome 
      forecasting and clinical detection are rapidly changing with the use of machine 
      learning (ML), one of the promising technologies used to analyze complex 
      biomedical data. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based ML models are capable of 
      determining low-level trends and making accurate predictions of disease risk and 
      outcomes, because they can combine different datasets (clinical records, 
      genomics, proteomics, medical imaging) and learn to identify subtle patterns. 
      Standard algorithms, including support vector machines, random forests, and deep 
      learning (DL) models, such as convolutional neural networks, have demonstrated 
      high potential in identifying the type of cancer, monitoring disease progression, 
      and designing treatment patterns. This manuscript reviews the recent developments 
      in the use of ML models to advance oncologic prediction tasks in gynecologic 
      oncology. It reports on critical domains, like screening, risk classification, 
      and survival modeling, as well as comments on difficulties, like data 
      inconsistency, inability of interpretation of models, and issues of clinical 
      interpretation. New developments, such as explainable AI, federated learning 
      (FL), and multi-omics fusion, are discussed to develop these models and to make 
      them applicable in practice because of their reliability. Conclusively, this 
      article emphasizes the transformative role of ML in precision oncology to deliver 
      improved, patient-centered outcomes to women who are victims of gynecological 
      cancers.

AB  - Integrating multi-omics data into predictive models has the potential to enhance 
      accuracy, which is essential for precision medicine. In this study, we developed 
      interpretable predictive models for multi-omics data by employing neural networks 
      informed by prior biological knowledge, referred to as visible networks. These 
      neural networks offer insights into the decision-making process and can unveil 
      novel perspectives on the underlying biological mechanisms associated with traits 
      and complex diseases. We tested the performance, interpretability and 
      generalizability for inferring smoking status, subject age and LDL levels using 
      genome-wide RNA expression and CpG methylation data from the blood of the BIOS 
      consortium (four population cohorts, N(total) = 2940). In a cohort-wise 
      cross-validation setting, the consistency of the diagnostic performance and 
      interpretation was assessed. Performance was consistently high for predicting 
      smoking status with an overall mean AUC of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.90-1.00) and 
      interpretation revealed the involvement of well-replicated genes such as AHRR, 
      GPR15 and LRRN3. LDL-level predictions were only generalized in a single cohort 
      with an R(2) of 0.07 (95% CI: 0.05-0.08). Age was inferred with a mean error of 
      5.16 (95% CI: 3.97-6.35) years with the genes COL11A2, AFAP1, OTUD7A, PTPRN2, 
      ADARB2 and CD34 consistently predictive. For both regression tasks, we found that 
      using multi-omics networks improved performance, stability and generalizability 
      compared to interpretable single omic networks. We believe that visible neural 
      networks have great potential for multi-omics analysis; they combine multi-omic 
      data elegantly, are interpretable, and generalize well to data from different 
      cohorts.

AB  - The integration of big data analytics and machine learning (ML) into hematology 
      has ushered in a new era of precision medicine, offering transformative insights 
      into disease management. By leveraging vast and diverse datasets, including 
      genomic profiles, clinical laboratory results, and imaging data, these 
      technologies enhance diagnostic accuracy, enable robust prognostic modeling, and 
      support personalized therapeutic interventions. Advanced ML algorithms, such as 
      neural networks and ensemble learning, facilitate the discovery of novel 
      biomarkers and refine risk stratification for hematological disorders, including 
      leukemias, lymphomas, and coagulopathies. Despite these advancements, significant 
      challenges persist, particularly in the realms of data integration, algorithm 
      validation, and ethical concerns. The heterogeneity of hematological datasets and 
      the lack of standardized frameworks complicate their application, while the 
      "black-box" nature of ML models raises issues of reliability and clinical trust. 
      Moreover, safeguarding patient privacy in an era of data-driven medicine remains 
      paramount, necessitating the development of secure and ethical analytical 
      practices. Addressing these challenges is critical to ensuring equitable and 
      effective implementation of these technologies. Collaborative efforts between 
      hematologists, data scientists, and bioinformaticians are pivotal in translating 
      these innovations into real-world clinical practice. Emphasis on developing 
      explainable artificial intelligence models, integrating real-time analytics, and 
      adopting federated learning approaches will further enhance the utility and 
      adoption of these technologies. As big data analytics and ML continue to evolve, 
      their potential to revolutionize hematology and improve patient outcomes remains 
      immense.

TI  - The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Lung Cancer Diagnosis and Personalized 
      Treatment.
LID - 10.3390/ijms26178472 [doi]
LID - 8472
AB  - Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality globally, despite the 
      advancements in screening and management. Survival rates for lung cancer remain 
      suboptimal, largely due to late-stage diagnoses and tumor heterogeneity. Recent 
      advancements in artificial intelligence and radiomics provide a promising outlook 
      for lung cancer screening, diagnosis, personalized treatment, and prognosis. 
      These advances use large-scale clinical and imaging datasets that help identify 
      patterns and predictive features that may be missed by human interpretation. 
      Artificial intelligence tools hold the potential to take clinical decision-making 
      to another level, thus improving patient outcomes. This review summarizes current 
      evidence on the applications, challenges, and future directions of artificial 
      intelligence (AI) in lung cancer care, with an emphasis on early diagnosis and 
      personalized treatment. We examine recent developments in AI-driven approaches, 
      including machine learning and deep neural networks, applied to imaging 
      (radiomics), histopathology, biomarker analysis, and multi-omic data integration. 
      AI-based models demonstrate promising performance in early detection, risk 
      stratification, molecular profiling (e.g., programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and 
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) status), and outcome prediction. These 
      tools may enhance diagnostic accuracy, optimize therapeutic decisions, and 
      ultimately improve patient outcomes. However, significant challenges remain, 
      including model heterogeneity, limited external validation, generalizability 
      issues, and ethical concerns related to transparency and clinical accountability. 
      AI holds transformative potential for lung cancer care but requires further 
      validation, standardization, and integration into clinical workflows. Multicenter 
      collaborations, regulatory frameworks, and explainable AI models will be 
      essential for successful clinical adoption.

AB  - Moving from a one-size-fits-all to an individual approach in precision medicine 
      requires a deeper understanding of disease molecular mechanisms. Especially in 
      heterogeneous complex diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), better 
      molecular stratification will help select the correct therapy. For this, we build 
      end-to-end biologically sparsified neural network architectures for IBD subtyping 
      based on whole exome sequence representations with gene-level and variant-level 
      resolution. By moving beyond univariate methods, we capitalize on the model's 
      ability to extract complex molecular patterns to improve prediction. Model 
      interpretation identifies the most predictive pathways, genes, and variants, 
      uncovering important intestinal barrier, immunological, and microbiome factors.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming cardiovascular imaging (CVI), 
      enhancing accuracy, efficiency, and diagnostic capability across echocardiography 
      (Echo), cardiac computed tomography (CCT), and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). 
      In Echo, AI improves image acquisition, segmentation, quantification of chamber 
      function, and detection of wall motion abnormalities, supporting diagnosis and 
      prognosis in various diseases. Automated two-dimensional and three-dimensional 
      (3D) analysis allows rapid, reproducible assessments of ventricular volumes and 
      EF. In valvular heart disease, AI assists in measurement, procedural planning, 
      and integration with 3D printing. CCT benefits from AI at every workflow stage, 
      from image acquisition to disease assessment. AI optimizes scanning protocols, 
      reduces radiation exposure, and enhances coronary artery calcium scoring, plaque 
      analysis, and ischemia evaluation. Algorithms enable rapid segmentation and 
      functional assessment, while ongoing studies support its utility in risk 
      prediction and plaque characterization. In CMR, AI accelerates acquisition, 
      reduces artifacts, and automates segmentation and tissue characterization. Deep 
      learning (DL) models accurately detect fibrosis, scar, and functional parameters, 
      positively influencing prognosis prediction in every cardiac disease. AI-driven 
      tools also streamline report generation, enhance Telemedicine workflow, and guide 
      less experienced users in image acquisition. Despite these advances, challenges 
      remain. Robust and diverse datasets, explainable AI models, regulatory approvals, 
      and ethical considerations are critical for safe and widespread adoption. AI's 
      "black box" nature hinders clinician trust, making interpretability essential. As 
      these barriers are addressed, AI is expected to become an essential tool in every 
      aspect of CVI, enabling personalized medicine, improving patient care, and 
      optimizing clinical workflows in the coming decades.

TI  - Applications of and issues with machine learning in medicine: Bridging the gap 
      with explainable AI.
PG  - 497-504
LID - 10.5582/bst.2024.01342 [doi]
AB  - In recent years, machine learning, and particularly deep learning, has shown 
      remarkable potential in various fields, including medicine. Advanced techniques 
      like convolutional neural networks and transformers have enabled high-performance 
      predictions for complex problems, making machine learning a valuable tool in 
      medical decision-making. From predicting postoperative complications to assessing 
      disease risk, machine learning has been actively used to analyze patient data and 
      assist healthcare professionals. However, the "black box" problem, wherein the 
      internal workings of machine learning models are opaque and difficult to 
      interpret, poses a significant challenge in medical applications. The lack of 
      transparency may hinder trust and acceptance by clinicians and patients, making 
      the development of explainable AI (XAI) techniques essential. XAI aims to provide 
      both global and local explanations for machine learning models, offering insights 
      into how predictions are made and which factors influence these outcomes. In this 
      article, we explore various applications of machine learning in medicine, 
      describe commonly used algorithms, and discuss explainable AI as a promising 
      solution to enhance the interpretability of these models. By integrating 
      explainability into machine learning, we aim to ensure its ethical and practical 
      application in healthcare, ultimately improving patient outcomes and supporting 
      personalized treatment strategies.

TI  - Harnessing artificial intelligence to address immune response heterogeneity in 
      low-dose radiation therapy.
PG  - 108011
LID - 10.4329/wjr.v17.i5.108011 [doi]
LID - 108011
AB  - Low-dose radiation therapy has emerged as a promising modality for cancer 
      treatment because of its ability to stimulate antitumor immune responses while 
      minimizing damage to healthy tissues. However, the significant heterogeneity in 
      immune responses among patients complicates its clinical application, hindering 
      outcome prediction and treatment personalization. Artificial intelligence (AI) 
      offers a transformative solution by integrating multidimensional data such as 
      immunomics, radiomics, and clinical features to decode complex immune patterns 
      and predict individual therapeutic outcomes. This editorial explored the 
      potential of AI to address immune response heterogeneity in low-dose radiation 
      therapy and proposed an AI-driven framework for precision immunotherapy. While 
      promising, challenges, including data standardization, model interpretability, 
      and clinical validation, must be overcome to ensure successful integration into 
      oncological practice.

LID - 975703
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer (OC) is the most lethal gynecological malignancy, with 
      limited early screening methods and poor prognosis. Artificial intelligence 
      technology has made a great breakthrough in cancer diagnosis. PURPOSE: We aim to 
      develop a specific interpretable machine learning (ML) prediction model for the 
      diagnosis and prognosis of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) based on a variety of 
      biomarkers. METHODS: A total of 521 patients with EOC and 144 patients with 
      benign gynecological diseases were enrolled including derivation datasets and an 
      external validation cohort. The predicted information was acquired by 9 
      supervised ML methods, through 34 parameters. Behind predicted reasons for the 
      best ML were improved by using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) 
      algorithm. In addition, the prognosis of EOC was analyzed by unsupervised 
      clustering and Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival analysis. RESULTS: ML technology was 
      superior to conventional logistic regression in predicting EOC diagnosis and 
      XGBoost performed best in the external validation datasets. The AUC values of 
      distinguishing EOC and benign disease patients, determining pathological type, 
      grade and clinical stage were 0.958 (0.926-0.989), 0.792 (0.701-0.8834), 0.819 
      (0.687-0.950) and 0.68 (0.573-0.788) respectively. For negative CA-125 EOC 
      patients, the AUC performance of XGBoost model was 0.835(0.763-0.907). We used 
      unsupervised cluster analysis to identify EOC subgroups with significantly poor 
      overall survival (p-value <0.0001) and recurrence-free survival (p-value 
      <0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the preoperative characteristics, we proved that 
      ML algorithm can provide an acceptable diagnosis and prognosis prediction model 
      for EOC patients. Meanwhile, SHAP analysis can improve the interpretability of ML 
      models and contribute to precision medicine.

TI  - Explainable artificial intelligence predicts inflammatory and spatial 
      heterogeneity from nasal polyp histology.
LID - S0091-6749(25)00898-X [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jaci.2025.08.016 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps is a heterogeneous disorder 
      characterized by diverse inflammatory signatures and endotypes. OBJECTIVE: We 
      sought to develop a histology-based deep learning network for predicting 
      inflammatory gene signatures and spatial patterns in chronic rhinosinusitis with 
      nasal polyps. METHODS: We developed HE2Signature, a deep learning model, using 70 
      hematoxylin and eosin-stained whole-slide images of nasal polyps paired with 
      corresponding endotypic signature gene expression profiles derived from 
      transcriptomic data. The model was validated in an internal cohort (n = 30) and 
      tested in an independent external cohort (n = 224) from 4 medical centers. The 
      performance was evaluated using correlation and confusion matrix analyses and 
      receiver-operating characteristic curves. Spatial predictions were validated by 
      immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The HE2Signature demonstrated strong positive 
      correlations between the predicted and actual expression levels of 28 of the 33 
      signature genes. The internal validation cohort was stratified into distinct 
      endotypes on the basis of predicted signature gene expression, achieving area 
      under the curve values of 0.833, 0.903, and 0.935 for the T1, T2, and T3 
      endotypes, respectively. In the external cohort, the combination of 
      HE2Signature-predicted Fc epsilon receptor II and CST1 effectively identified the 
      T2 endotype, with a receiver-operating characteristic value of 0.716. 
      Histopathologic examination of high-prediction patches revealed characteristic 
      features associated with signature gene expression. Heatmaps and 
      immunohistochemistry confirmed the accuracy of the model in mapping spatial gene 
      expression patterns. HE2Signature-predicted spatial expression of signature genes 
      correlated with blood and tissue eosinophil counts, Lund-Kennedy score, and 
      Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 score, particularly within subepithelial regions. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our study introduces the first histology-based, explainable deep 
      learning model capable of predicting inflammatory gene signatures and spatial 
      molecular heterogeneity. This proof-of-concept highlights that artificial 
      intelligence-powered histopathologic analysis can generate digital biomarkers by 
      linking tissue patterns with molecular profiles, providing a clinically 
      applicable framework for endotype-guided precision medicine in chronic 
      rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.

LID - 2549
AB  - The global healthcare sector continues to grow rapidly and is reflected as one of 
      the fastest-growing sectors in the fourth industrial revolution (4.0). The 
      majority of the healthcare industry still uses labor-intensive, time-consuming, 
      and error-prone traditional, manual, and manpower-based methods. This review 
      addresses the current paradigm, the potential for new scientific discoveries, the 
      technological state of preparation, the potential for supervised machine learning 
      (SML) prospects in various healthcare sectors, and ethical issues. The 
      effectiveness and potential for innovation of disease diagnosis, personalized 
      medicine, clinical trials, non-invasive image analysis, drug discovery, patient 
      care services, remote patient monitoring, hospital data, and nanotechnology in 
      various learning-based automation in healthcare along with the requirement for 
      explainable artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare are evaluated. In order to 
      understand the potential architecture of non-invasive treatment, a thorough study 
      of medical imaging analysis from a technical point of view is presented. This 
      study also represents new thinking and developments that will push the boundaries 
      and increase the opportunity for healthcare through AI and SML in the near 
      future. Nowadays, SML-based applications require a lot of data quality awareness 
      as healthcare is data-heavy, and knowledge management is paramount. Nowadays, SML 
      in biomedical and healthcare developments needs skills, quality data 
      consciousness for data-intensive study, and a knowledge-centric health management 
      system. As a result, the merits, demerits, and precautions need to take ethics 
      and the other effects of AI and SML into consideration. The overall insight in 
      this paper will help researchers in academia and industry to understand and 
      address the future research that needs to be discussed on SML in the healthcare 
      and biomedical sectors.

TI  - From explainable to interpretable deep learning for natural language processing 
      in healthcare: How far from reality?
PG  - 362-373
LID - 10.1016/j.csbj.2024.05.004 [doi]
AB  - Deep learning (DL) has substantially enhanced natural language processing (NLP) 
      in healthcare research. However, the increasing complexity of DL-based NLP 
      necessitates transparent model interpretability, or at least explainability, for 
      reliable decision-making. This work presents a thorough scoping review of 
      explainable and interpretable DL in healthcare NLP. The term "eXplainable and 
      Interpretable Artificial Intelligence" (XIAI) is introduced to distinguish XAI 
      from IAI. Different models are further categorized based on their functionality 
      (model-, input-, output-based) and scope (local, global). Our analysis shows that 
      attention mechanisms are the most prevalent emerging IAI technique. The use of 
      IAI is growing, distinguishing it from XAI. The major challenges identified are 
      that most XIAI does not explore "global" modelling processes, the lack of best 
      practices, and the lack of systematic evaluation and benchmarks. One important 
      opportunity is to use attention mechanisms to enhance multi-modal XIAI for 
      personalized medicine. Additionally, combining DL with causal logic holds 
      promise. Our discussion encourages the integration of XIAI in Large Language 
      Models (LLMs) and domain-specific smaller models. In conclusion, XIAI adoption in 
      healthcare requires dedicated in-house expertise. Collaboration with domain 
      experts, end-users, and policymakers can lead to ready-to-use XIAI methods across 
      NLP and medical tasks. While challenges exist, XIAI techniques offer a valuable 
      foundation for interpretable NLP algorithms in healthcare.

LID - 10.1089/cbr.2021.0152 [doi]
AB  - The landscape of nuclear oncology is rapidly changing. The advent of molecular 
      radionuclide theranostics, multidisciplinary tumor board decision making, 
      artificial intelligence and radiomics interpretation of diagnostic imaging, 
      evolution of pharmacogenomics prediction of tumor response, and regulatory 
      requirements for prospective individual dosimetry are just some of the elements 
      which are broadening the essence of physician responsibility. The burgeoning 
      knowledge base essential for mastering the emergent technologies, and their 
      profound effect on moral philosophic aspects of provision of cancer care, are 
      challenging. The new relationship of the theranostic nuclear physician with 
      respect to shared care of the individual patient, particularly with regard to 
      transparency, accountability, and responsibility for targeted radionuclide 
      diagnosis and therapy of cancer, will be explored in this update.

      stewardship and infection prevention and control.
PG  - 290-295
LID - 10.1097/QCO.0000000000001028 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review examines the current state and future prospects of 
      machine learning (ML) in infection prevention and control (IPC) and antimicrobial 
      stewardship (ASP), highlighting its potential to transform healthcare practices 
      by enhancing the precision, efficiency, and effectiveness of interventions 
      against infections and antimicrobial resistance. RECENT FINDINGS: ML has shown 
      promise in improving surveillance and detection of infections, predicting 
      infection risk, and optimizing antimicrobial use through the development of 
      predictive analytics, natural language processing, and personalized medicine 
      approaches. However, challenges remain, including issues related to data quality, 
      model interpretability, ethical considerations, and integration into clinical 
      workflows. SUMMARY: Despite these challenges, the future of ML in IPC and ASP is 
      promising, with interdisciplinary collaboration identified as a key factor in 
      overcoming existing barriers. ML's role in advancing personalized medicine, 
      real-time disease monitoring, and effective IPC and ASP strategies signifies a 
      pivotal shift towards safer, more efficient healthcare environments and improved 
      patient care in the face of global antimicrobial resistance challenges.

TI  - Deciphering DNA nucleotide sequences and their rotation dynamics with 
      interpretable machine learning integrated C(3)N nanopores.
PG  - 18080-18092
LID - 10.1039/d3nr03771a [doi]
AB  - A solid-state nanopore combined with the quantum transport method has garnered 
      substantial attention and intrigue for DNA sequencing due to its potential for 
      providing rapid and accurate sequencing results, which could have numerous 
      applications in disease diagnosis and personalized medicine. However, the 
      intricate and multifaceted nature of the experimental protocol poses a formidable 
      challenge in attaining precise single nucleotide analysis. Here, we report a 
      machine learning (ML) framework combined with the quantum transport method to 
      accelerate high-throughput single nucleotide recognition with C(3)N nanopores. 
      The optimized eXtreme Gradient Boosting Regression (XGBR) algorithm has predicted 
      the fingerprint transmission of each unknown nucleotide and their rotation 
      dynamics with root mean square error scores as low as 0.07. Interpretability of 
      ML black box models with the game theory-based SHapley Additive exPlanation 
      method has provided a quasi-explanation for the model working principle and the 
      complex relationship between electrode-nucleotide coupling and transmission. 
      Moreover, a comprehensive ML classification of nucleotides based on binary, 
      ternary, and quaternary combinations shows maximum accuracy and F1 scores of 
      100%. The results suggest that ML in tandem with a nanopore device can 
      potentially alleviate the experimental hurdles associated with quantum tunneling 
      and facilitate fast and high-precision DNA sequencing.

AB  - Accurate cancer prognosis is essential for personalized clinical management, 
      guiding treatment strategies and predicting patient survival. Conventional 
      methods, which depend on the subjective evaluation of histopathological features, 
      exhibit significant inter-observer variability and limited predictive power. To 
      overcome these limitations, we developed cross-attention transformer-based 
      multimodal fusion network (CATfusion), a deep learning framework that integrates 
      multimodal histology-genomic data for comprehensive cancer survival prediction. 
      By employing self-supervised learning strategy with TabAE for feature extraction 
      and utilizing cross-attention mechanisms to fuse diverse data types, including 
      mRNA-seq, miRNA-seq, copy number variation, DNA methylation variation, mutation 
      data, and histopathological images. By successfully integrating this multi-tiered 
      patient information, CATfusion has become an advanced survival prediction model 
      to utilize the most diverse data types across various cancer types. CATfusion's 
      architecture, which includes a bidirectional multimodal attention mechanism and 
      self-attention block, is adept at synchronizing the learning and integration of 
      representations from various modalities. CATfusion achieves superior predictive 
      performance over traditional and unimodal models, as demonstrated by enhanced 
      C-index and survival area under the curve scores. The model's high accuracy in 
      stratifying patients into distinct risk groups is a boon for personalized 
      medicine, enabling tailored treatment plans. Moreover, CATfusion's 
      interpretability, enabled by attention-based visualization, offers insights into 
      the biological underpinnings of cancer prognosis, underscoring its potential as a 
      transformative tool in oncology.

TI  - Towards Personalized AI-Based Diabetes Therapy: A Review.
PG  - 6944-6957

AB  - Insulin pumps and other smart devices have recently made significant advancements 
      in the treatment of diabetes, a disorder that affects people all over the world. 
      The development of medical AI has been influenced by AI methods designed to help 
      physicians make diagnoses, choose a course of therapy, and predict outcomes. In 
      this article, we thoroughly analyse how AI is being used to enhance and 
      personalize diabetes treatment. The search turned up 77 original research papers, 
      from which we've selected the most crucial information regarding the learning 
      models employed, the data typology, the deployment stage, and the application 
      domains. We identified two key trends, enabled mostly by AI: patient-based 
      therapy personalization and therapeutic algorithm optimization. In the meanwhile, 
      we point out various shortcomings in the existing literature, like a lack of 
      multimodal database analysis or a lack of interpretability. The rapid 
      improvements in AI and the expansion of the amount of data already available 
      offer the possibility to overcome these difficulties shortly and enable a wider 
      deployment of this technology in clinical settings.

TI  - The Role of Artificial Intelligence in Health Care.
PG  - 1-8
LID - 10.54548/njps.v39i1.1 [doi]
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a leading role in transmuting the field of 
      healthcare. Numerous aspects of AI have been incorporated into the healthcare 
      delivery system. For instance, in disease diagnosis, the practice of personalised 
      treatment plans and precision medicine are AI-dependent. This review gives a 
      widespread role of AI in healthcare, with a focus on applications, and 
      challenges. Deep brain stimulation, statistical analysis, machine learning, and 
      deep learning are a few examples of AI-powered technologies that have contributed 
      immensely to biomedical research and medical imaging advancement. Moreover, AI 
      algorithms are pivotal in genomics research, easing the identification of genetic 
      markers related to disease vulnerability and treatment reaction, thereby aiding 
      the practice of precision medicine. Apart from diagnosis and treatment 
      strategies, AI assists in healthcare management and resource optimization, along 
      with the discovery and therapy of drugs. Forecasting of disease outbreaks, 
      effective allocation of hospital resources, and management of patient traffic 
      rely mostly on predictive analytics driven by AI. Again, AI-powered virtual 
      health assistance, telemedicine has aided patient appointments and support, 
      giving real-time support and health recommendations. Although AI algorithms 
      provide outstanding breakthroughs in healthcare, AI adoption is cumbered by 
      numerous dares such as monetary concerns, regulatory hurdles, data privacy fears, 
      and ethical considerations associated with AI applications, such as algorithm 
      bias and transparency. Futuristically, AI application in healthcare holds vast 
      potential, such as early disease detection, drug discovery, and optimization of 
      treatment. Concerted efforts targeted at tackling the prevailing challenges and 
      creating holistic control would be important to tie together the full potential 
      of AI in rejuvenating the healthcare delivery system.

TI  - Explainable AI for Estimating Pathogenicity of Genetic Variants Using Large-Scale 
      Knowledge Graphs.
LID - 10.3390/cancers15041118 [doi]
LID - 1118
AB  - BACKGROUND: To treat diseases caused by genetic variants, it is necessary to 
      identify disease-causing variants in patients. However, since there are a large 
      number of disease-causing variants, the application of AI is required. We propose 
      AI to solve this problem and report the results of its application in identifying 
      disease-causing variants. METHODS: To assist physicians in their task of 
      identifying disease-causing variants, we propose an explainable AI (XAI) that 
      combines high estimation accuracy with explainability using a knowledge graph. We 
      integrated databases for genomic medicine and constructed a large knowledge graph 
      that was used to achieve the XAI. RESULTS: We compared our XAI with random 
      forests and decision trees. CONCLUSION: We propose an XAI that uses knowledge 
      graphs for explanation. The proposed method achieves high estimation performance 
      and explainability. This will support the promotion of genomic medicine.

AB  - The application of deep learning algorithms for medical diagnosis in the real 
      world faces challenges with transparency and interpretability. The labeling of 
      large-scale samples leads to costly investment in developing deep learning 
      algorithms. The application of human prior knowledge is an effective way to solve 
      these problems. Previously, we developed a deep learning system for glaucoma 
      diagnosis based on a large number of samples that had high sensitivity and 
      specificity. However, it is a black box and the specific analytic methods cannot 
      be elucidated. Here, we establish a hierarchical deep learning system based on a 
      small number of samples that comprehensively simulates the diagnostic thinking of 
      human experts. This system can extract the anatomical characteristics of the 
      fundus images, including the optic disc, optic cup, and appearance of the retinal 
      nerve fiber layer to realize automatic diagnosis of glaucoma. In addition, this 
      system is transparent and interpretable, and the intermediate process of 
      prediction can be visualized. Applying this system to three validation datasets 
      of fundus images, we demonstrate performance comparable to that of human experts 
      in diagnosing glaucoma. Moreover, it markedly improves the diagnostic accuracy of 
      ophthalmologists. This system may expedite the screening and diagnosis of 
      glaucoma, resulting in improved clinical outcomes.

AB  - Drug response prediction is important to establish personalized medicine for 
      cancer therapy. Model construction for predicting drug response (i.e., cell 
      viability half-maximal inhibitory concentration [IC(50)]) of an individual drug 
      by inputting pharmacogenomics in disease models remains critical. Machine 
      learning (ML) has been predominantly applied for prediction, despite the advent 
      of deep learning (DL). Moreover, whether DL or traditional ML models are superior 
      for predicting cell viability IC(50s) has to be established. Herein, we 
      constructed ML and DL drug response prediction models for 24 individual drugs and 
      compared the performance of the models by employing gene expression and mutation 
      profiles of cancer cell lines as input. We observed no significant difference in 
      drug response prediction performance between DL and ML models for 24 drugs [root 
      mean squared error (RMSE) ranging from 0.284 to 3.563 for DL and from 0.274 to 
      2.697 for ML; R(2) ranging from -7.405 to 0.331 for DL and from -8.113 to 0.470 
      for ML]. Among the 24 individual drugs, the ridge model of panobinostat exhibited 
      the best performance (R(2) 0.470 and RMSE 0.623). Thus, we selected the ridge 
      model of panobinostat for further application of explainable artificial 
      intelligence (XAI). Using XAI, we further identified important genomic features 
      for panobinostat response prediction in the ridge model, suggesting the genomic 
      features of 22 genes. Based on our findings, results for an individual drug 
      employing both DL and ML models were comparable. Our study confirms the 
      applicability of drug response prediction models for individual drugs.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing epilepsy care by advancing 
      seizure detection, enhancing diagnostic precision, and enabling personalized 
      treatment. Machine learning and deep learning technologies improve seizure 
      monitoring, automate EEG analysis, and facilitate tailored therapeutic 
      strategies, addressing the complexities of epilepsy management. However, 
      challenges remain, including issues of model accuracy, interpretability, and 
      applicability across diverse patient populations. Ethical considerations, such as 
      safeguarding patient privacy, ensuring data security, and mitigating algorithmic 
      bias, underscore the importance of responsible AI integration. Collaborative 
      efforts among neurologists, data scientists, and regulatory authorities are 
      critical to refining models, establishing ethical guidelines, and ensuring safe 
      clinical adoption. This review examines AI's transformative potential, its 
      current limitations, and the multidisciplinary initiatives driving its effective 
      implementation in epilepsy care.

AB  - Cancer remains a significant health issue, resulting in around 10 million deaths 
      per year, particularly in developing nations. Demographic changes, socio-economic 
      variables, and lifestyle choices are responsible for the rise in cancer cases. 
      Despite the potential to mitigate the adverse effects of cancer by early 
      detection and the implementation of cancer prevention methods, several nations 
      have limited screening facilities. In oncology, the use of artificial 
      intelligence (AI) represents a transformative advancement in cancer diagnosis, 
      prognosis, and treatment. The use of AI in biomarker discovery improves precision 
      medicine by uncovering biomarker signatures that are essential for early 
      detection and treatment of diseases within vast and diverse datasets. Deep 
      learning and machine learning diagnostics are two examples of AI technologies 
      that are changing the way biomarkers are made by finding patterns in large 
      datasets and making new technologies that make it possible to deliver accurate 
      and effective therapies. Existing gaps include data quality, algorithmic 
      transparency, and ethical concerns around privacy, among others. The advancement 
      of biomarker discovery methodologies with AI seeks to transform cancer by 
      improving patient survival rates through enhanced early diagnosis and targeted 
      therapy. This commentary aims to clarify how AI is improving the identification 
      of novel biomarkers for optimal early diagnosis, focused treatment, and improved 
      clinical outcomes, while also addressing certain obstacles and ethical issues 
      related to the application of artificial intelligence in oncology. Data from 
      reputable scientific databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and ScienceDirect were 
      utilized.

AB  - Data-driven algorithms have proven to be effective for a variety of medical 
      tasks, including disease categorization and prediction, personalized medicine 
      design, and imaging diagnostics. Although their performance is frequently on par 
      with that of clinicians, their widespread use is constrained by a number of 
      obstacles, including the requirement for high-quality data that are typical of 
      the population, the difficulty of explaining how they operate, and ethical and 
      regulatory concerns. The use of data augmentation and synthetic data generation 
      methodologies, such as federated learning and explainable artificial intelligence 
      ones, could provide a viable solution to the current issues, facilitating the 
      widespread application of artificial intelligence algorithms in the clinical 
      application domain and reducing the time needed for prevention, diagnosis, and 
      prognosis by up to 70%. To this end, a novel AI-based functional framework is 
      conceived and presented in this paper.

AB  - AI decision support systems can assist clinicians in planning adaptive treatment 
      strategies that can dynamically react to individuals' cancer progression for 
      effective personalized care. However, AI's imperfections can lead to suboptimal 
      therapeutics if clinicians over or under rely on AI. To investigate such 
      collaborative decision-making process, we conducted a Human-AI interaction study 
      on response-adaptive radiotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer and 
      hepatocellular carcinoma. We investigated two levels of collaborative behavior: 
      model-agnostic and model-specific; and found that Human-AI interaction is 
      multifactorial and depends on the complex interrelationship between prior 
      knowledge and preferences, patient's state, disease site, treatment modality, 
      model transparency, and AI's learned behavior and biases. In summary, some 
      clinicians may disregard AI recommendations due to skepticism; others will 
      critically analyze AI recommendations on a case-by-case basis; clinicians will 
      adjust their decisions if they find AI recommendations beneficial to patients; 
      and clinician will disregard AI recommendations if deemed harmful or suboptimal 
      and seek alternatives.

      discuss various machine learning approaches, primarily focusing on convolutional 
      neural networks and natural language processing, and their utilization in 
      predicting protein secondary and tertiary structures, residue-residue contacts, 
      protein function, and subcellular localization. Furthermore, we highlight the 
      challenges associated with using machine learning techniques in this context, 
      such as the availability of high-quality training datasets and the 
      interpretability of models. We also delve into the latest progress in the field 
      concerning the advancements made in the development of intricate deep learning 
      architectures. Overall, this review underscores the significance of machine 
      learning in advancing our understanding of protein structure and function, and 
      its potential to revolutionize drug discovery and personalized medicine.

TI  - Transforming Drug Therapy with Deep Learning: The Future of Personalized 
      Medicine.
LID - 10.1055/a-2682-5167 [doi]
AB  - Personalized medicine represents a paradigm shift in healthcare, aiming to tailor 
      treatment strategies to the unique genetic, environmental, and lifestyle 
      characteristics of individual patients. This approach holds immense potential for 
      improving therapeutic efficacy and minimizing adverse drug reactions. With the 
      rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, deep learning has emerged as a 
      transformative tool in pharmacology, enabling precise modeling of complex 
      biological data and uncovering hidden patterns in patient-specific information. 
      This study investigates the application of deep learning techniques - such as 
      Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), 
      Transformer architectures, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) - in 
      optimizing personalized treatment strategies. Using a diverse dataset comprising 
      electronic health records (EHRs), genomic sequences, and clinical indicators, we 
      developed and trained deep learning models for tasks including drug response 
      prediction, biomarker identification, and adverse drug reaction (ADR) 
      forecasting. Among the models evaluated, Transformer-based architectures 
      demonstrated superior performance, achieving an accuracy of 91.2% and an AUC-ROC 
      of 0.92 in drug response prediction tasks. Moreover, the integration of deep 
      learning models into the treatment pipeline resulted in a 20-30% improvement in 
      drug-patient matching efficiency compared to traditional statistical methods. The 
      findings underscore the potential of AI-powered systems to enhance clinical 
      decision-making and enable precision pharmacotherapy. However, challenges such as 
      data privacy, model interpretability, and regulatory compliance remain critical 
      barriers to widespread adoption. The study also explores future directions, 
      including the implementation of explainable AI (XAI) and federated learning, to 
      address these limitations and facilitate the integration of deep learning into 
      routine clinical practice.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods are being increasingly 
      investigated as a means to generate predictive models applicable in the clinical 
      practice. In this study, we developed a model to predict the efficacy of 
      immunotherapy (IO) in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
      using eXplainable AI (XAI) Machine Learning (ML) methods. METHODS: We 
      prospectively collected real-world data from patients with an advanced NSCLC 
      condition receiving immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) either as a single agent 
      or in combination with chemotherapy. With regards to six different outcomes - 
      Disease Control Rate (DCR), Objective Response Rate (ORR), 6 and 24-month Overall 
      Survival (OS6 and OS24), 3-months Progression-Free Survival (PFS3) and Time to 
      Treatment Failure (TTF3) - we evaluated five different classification ML models: 
      CatBoost (CB), Logistic Regression (LR), Neural Network (NN), Random Forest (RF) 
      and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We used the Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) 
      values to explain model predictions. RESULTS: Of 480 patients included in the 
      study 407 received immunotherapy and 73 chemo- and immunotherapy. From all the ML 
      models, CB performed the best for OS6 and TTF3, (accuracy 0.83 and 0.81, 
      respectively). CB and LR reached accuracy of 0.75 and 0.73 for the outcome DCR. 
      SHAP for CB demonstrated that the feature that strongly influences models' 
      prediction for all three outcomes was Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR). 
      Performance Status (ECOG-PS) was an important feature for the outcomes OS6 and 
      TTF3, while PD-L1, Line of IO and chemo-immunotherapy appeared to be more 
      important in predicting DCR. CONCLUSIONS: In this study we developed a ML 
      algorithm based on real-world data, explained by SHAP techniques, and able to 
      accurately predict the efficacy of immunotherapy in sets of NSCLC patients.

AB  - Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has emerged as a transformative 
      analytical tool in disease diagnostics, offering unparalleled sensitivity and 
      molecular fingerprinting capabilities. However, its clinical translation is 
      hindered by the inherent complexity of spectral data, including noise 
      interference, overlapping peaks, and labor-intensive manual analysis. The 
      integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has opened 
      new frontiers in SERS-driven diagnostics by enabling automated data processing, 
      robust feature extraction, and high-accuracy classification. This article 
      systematically explores the synergistic potential of AI/ML and SERS in advancing 
      disease detection, with a focus on cancer, infectious diseases, and 
      neurodegenerative disorders. We highlight cutting-edge methodologies and 
      explainable AI tools designed to enhance clinical trustworthiness. Case studies 
      demonstrate the efficacy of AI/ML-SERS integration in early cancer detection, 
      rapid pathogen identification, and monitoring neurodegenerative disease 
      progression. Despite these advancements, challenges such as limited datasets, 
      model interpretability, and hardware-software integration remain critical 
      barriers to clinical application. Future directions emphasize multimodal 
      learning, portable SERS-AI devices, and standardized validation protocols. By 
      bridging the gap between nanotechnology, biomedicine, and computational science, 
      this interdisciplinary approach holds promise for redefining precision 
      diagnostics.

AB  - Machine learning-based tools are capable of guiding individualized clinical 
      management and decision-making by providing predictions of a patient's future 
      health state. Through their ability to model complex nonlinear relationships, ML 
      algorithms can often outperform traditional statistical prediction approaches, 
      but the use of nonlinear functions can mean that ML techniques may also be less 
      interpretable than traditional statistical methodologies. While there are 
      benefits of intrinsic interpretability, many model-agnostic approaches now exist 
      and can provide insight into the way in which ML systems make decisions. In this 
      paper, we describe how different algorithms can be interpreted and introduce some 
      techniques for interpreting complex nonlinear algorithms.

LID - 10.1111/cbdd.14568 [doi]
AB  - The utilization of large language models (LLMs) has become a significant 
      advancement in the domains of medicine and clinical informatics, providing a 
      revolutionary potential for scientific breakthroughs and customized therapies. 
      LLM models are trained on large datasets and exhibit the capacity to comprehend 
      and analyze intricate biological data, encompassing genomic sequences, protein 
      structures, and clinical health records. With the utilization of their 
      comprehension of the language of biology, they possess the ability to reveal 
      concealed patterns and insights that may evade human researchers. LLMs have been 
      shown to positively impact various aspects of molecular biology, including the 
      following: genomic analysis, drug development, precision medicine, biomarker 
      development, experimental design, collaborative research, and accessibility to 
      specialized expertise. However, it is imperative to acknowledge and tackle the 
      obstacles and ethical implications involved. The careful consideration of data 
      bias and generalization, data privacy and security, explainability and 
      interpretability, and ethical concerns around responsible application is vital. 
      The successful resolution of these obstacles will enable us to fully utilize the 
      capabilities of LLMs, leading to substantial progress in the fields of molecular 
      biology and pharmaceutical research. This progression also has the ability to 
      bolster influential impacts for both the individual and the broader community.

AB  - Enabling precision medicine requires developing robust patient stratification 
      methods as well as drugs tailored to homogeneous subgroups of patients from a 
      heterogeneous population. Developing de novo drugs is expensive and time 
      consuming with an ultimately low FDA approval rate. These limitations make 
      developing new drugs for a small portion of a disease population unfeasible. 
      Therefore, drug repositioning is an essential alternative for developing new 
      drugs for a disease subpopulation. This shows the importance of developing 
      data-driven approaches that find druggable homogeneous subgroups within the 
      disease population and reposition the drugs for these subgroups. In this study, 
      we developed an explainable AI approach for patient stratification and drug 
      repositioning. Contrast pattern mining and network analysis were used to discover 
      homogeneous subgroups within a disease population. For each subgroup, a 
      biomedical network analysis was done to find the drugs that are most relevant to 
      a given subgroup of patients. The set of candidate drugs for each subgroup was 
      ranked using an aggregated drug score assigned to each drug. The proposed method 
      represents a human-in-the-loop framework, where medical experts use the 
      data-driven results to generate hypotheses and obtain insights into potential 
      therapeutic candidates for patients who belong to a subgroup. Colorectal cancer 
      (CRC) was used as a case study. Patients' phenotypic and genotypic data was 
      utilized with a heterogeneous knowledge base because it gives a multi-view 
      perspective for finding new indications for drugs outside of their original use. 
      Our analysis of the top candidate drugs for the subgroups identified by medical 
      experts showed that most of these drugs are cancer-related, and most of them have 
      the potential to be a CRC regimen based on studies in the literature.

AB  - Prediction of the response of cancer patients to different treatments and 
      identification of biomarkers of drug response are two major goals of 
      individualized medicine. Here, we developed a deep learning framework called 
      TINDL, completely trained on preclinical cancer cell lines (CCLs), to predict the 
      response of cancer patients to different treatments. TINDL utilizes a 
      tissue-informed normalization to account for the tissue type and cancer type of 
      the tumors and to reduce the statistical discrepancies between CCLs and patient 
      tumors. Moreover, by making the deep learning black box interpretable, this model 
      identifies a small set of genes whose expression levels are predictive of drug 
      response in the trained model, enabling identification of biomarkers of drug 
      response. Using data from two large databases of CCLs and cancer tumors, we 
      showed that this model can distinguish between sensitive and resistant tumors for 
      10 (out of 14) drugs, outperforming various other machine learning models. In 
      addition, our small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown experiments on 10 genes 
      identified by this model for one of the drugs (tamoxifen) confirmed that 
      tamoxifen sensitivity is substantially influenced by all of these genes in MCF7 
      cells, and seven of these genes in T47D cells. Furthermore, genes implicated for 
      multiple drugs pointed to shared mechanism of action among drugs and suggested 
      several important signaling pathways. In summary, this study provides a powerful 
      deep learning framework for prediction of drug response and identification of 
      biomarkers of drug response in cancer. The code can be accessed at

AB  - The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into oncology drug discovery is 
      redefining the traditional pipeline by accelerating discovery, optimizing drug 
      efficacy, and minimizing toxicity. AI has enabled groundbreaking advancements in 
      molecular modeling, simulation techniques, and the identification of novel 
      compounds, including anti-tumor and antibodies, while elucidating mechanisms of 
      drug toxicity. Additionally, AI has emerged as a critical tool in precision 
      medicine, driving the formulation and release of targeted therapies and improving 
      the development of treatments for oncology and central nervous system diseases. 
      Furthermore, AI-assisted clinical trial designs have further optimized the 
      recruitment and stratification of patients, reducing the time and cost of trials. 
      Despite these advancements, challenges such as data integration, transparency, 
      and ethical considerations persist. By synthesizing current innovations, this 
      manuscript provides a comprehensive analysis of AI-driven approaches in drug 
      discovery and their potential to advance oncology therapeutics and precision 
      medicine. It examines the transformative role of AI across the drug development 
      continuum, with a focus on its applications in computer-aided drug design (CADD), 
      generative artificial intelligence (GAI), and high-throughput screening (HTS).

TI  - Artificial intelligence to predict inhibitors of drug-metabolizing enzymes and 
      transporters for safer drug design.
PG  - 621-641
LID - 10.1080/17460441.2025.2491669 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Drug-metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) and transporters (DTs) play 
      integral roles in drug metabolism and drug-drug interactions (DDIs) which 
      directly impact drug efficacy and safety. It is well-established that inhibition 
      of DMEs and DTs often leads to adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and therapeutic 
      failure. As such, early prediction of such inhibitors is vital in drug 
      development. In this context, the limitations of the traditional in vitro assays 
      and QSAR models methods have been addressed by harnessing artificial intelligence 
      (AI) techniques. AREAS COVERED: This narrative review presents the insights 
      gained from the application of AI for predicting DME and DT inhibitors over the 
      past decade. Several case studies demonstrate successful AI applications in 
      enzyme-transporter interaction prediction, and the authors discuss workflows for 
      integrating these predictions into drug design and regulatory frameworks. EXPERT 
      OPINION: The application of AI in predicting DME and DT inhibitors has 
      demonstrated significant potential toward enhancing drug safety and 
      effectiveness. However, critical challenges involve the data quality, biases, and 
      model transparency. The availability of diverse, high-quality datasets alongside 
      the integration of pharmacokinetic and genomic data are essential. Lastly, the 
      collaboration among computational scientists, pharmacologists, and regulatory 
      bodies is pyramidal in tailoring AI tools for personalized medicine and safer 
      drug development.

AB  - Glioma constitutes the most common type of primary brain tumor with a dismal 
      survival, often measured in terms of months or years. The thin line between 
      treatment effectiveness and patient harm underpins the importance of tailoring 
      clinical management to the individual patient. Randomized trials have laid the 
      foundation for many neuro-oncological guidelines. Despite this, their findings 
      focus on group-level estimates. Given our current tools, we are limited in our 
      ability to guide patients on what therapy is best for them as individuals, or 
      even how long they should expect to survive. Machine learning, however, promises 
      to provide the analytical support for personalizing treatment decisions, and deep 
      learning allows clinicians to unlock insight from the vast amount of unstructured 
      data that is collected on glioma patients. Although these novel techniques have 
      achieved astonishing results across a variety of clinical applications, 
      significant hurdles remain associated with the implementation of them in clinical 
      practice. Future challenges include the assembly of well-curated 
      cross-institutional datasets, improvement of the interpretability of machine 
      learning models, and balancing novel evidence-based decision-making with the 
      associated liability of automated inference. Although artificial intelligence 
      already exceeds clinical expertise in a variety of applications, clinicians 
      remain responsible for interpreting the implications of, and acting upon, each 
      prediction.

      heterogeneous treatment effects.
PG  - 5234-5271
LID - 10.1002/sim.10180 [doi]
AB  - With an increasing focus on precision medicine in medical research, numerous 
      studies have been conducted in recent years to clarify the relationship between 
      treatment effects and patient characteristics. The treatment effects for patients 
      with different characteristics are always heterogeneous, and therefore, various 
      heterogeneous treatment effect machine learning estimation methods have been 
      proposed owing to their flexibility and high estimation accuracy. However, most 
      machine learning methods rely on black-box models, preventing direct 
      interpretation of the relationship between patient characteristics and treatment 
      effects. Moreover, most of these studies have focused on continuous or binary 
      outcomes, although survival outcomes are also important in medical research. To 
      address these challenges, we propose a heterogeneous treatment effect estimation 
      method for survival data based on RuleFit, an interpretable machine learning 
      method. Numerical simulation results confirmed that the prediction performance of 
      the proposed method was comparable to that of existing methods. We also applied a 
      dataset from an HIV study, the AIDS Clinical Trials Group Protocol 175 dataset, 
      to illustrate the interpretability of the proposed method using real data. 
      Consequently, the proposed survival causal rule ensemble method provides an 
      interpretable model with sufficient estimation accuracy.

AB  - Neurogenetic disorders (NeD) are a group of neurological conditions resulting 
      from inherited genetic defects. By affecting the normal functioning of the 
      nervous system, these diseases lead to serious problems in movement, cognition, 
      and other body functions. In recent years, machine learning (ML) approaches have 
      proven highly effective, enabling the analysis and processing of vast amounts of 
      medical data. By analyzing genetic data, medical imaging, and other clinical 
      data, these techniques can contribute to early diagnosis and more effective 
      treatment of NeD. However, using these approaches is challenged by issues 
      including data variability, model explainability, and the requirement for 
      interdisciplinary collaboration. This paper investigates the impact of ML on 
      healthcare diagnosis and care of common NeD, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
      Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and Multiple Sclerosis 
      disease (MSD). The purpose of this research is to determine the opportunities and 
      challenges of using these techniques in the field of neurogenetic medicine. Our 
      findings show that using ML can increase the detection accuracy by 85 % and 
      reduce the detection time by 60 %. Additionally, the use of these techniques in 
      predicting patient prognosis has been 70 % more accurate than traditional 
      methods. Ultimately, this research will enable medical professionals and 
      researchers to leverage ML approaches in advancing the diagnostic and therapeutic 
      processes of NeD by identifying the opportunities and challenges.

AB  - AI has propelled the potential for moving toward personalized health and early 
      prediction of diseases. Unfortunately, a significant limitation of many of these 
      deep learning models is that they are not interpretable, restricting their 
      clinical utility and undermining trust by clinicians. However, all existing 
      methods are non-informative because they report generic or post-hoc explanations, 
      and few or none support patient-specific, accurate, individualized patient-level 
      explanations. Furthermore, existing approaches are often restricted to static, 
      limited-domain datasets and are not generalizable across various healthcare 
      scenarios. To tackle these problems, we propose a new deep learning approach 
      called PersonalCareNet for personalized health monitoring based on the MIMIC-III 
      clinical dataset. Our system jointly models convolutional neural networks with 
      attention (CHARMS) and employs SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations) to obtain 
      global and patient-specific model interpretability. We believe the model, enabled 
      to leverage many clinical features, would offer clinically interpretable insights 
      into the contribution of features while supporting real-time risk prediction, 
      thus increasing transparency and instilling clinically-oriented trust in the 
      model. We provide an extensive evaluation that shows PersonalCareNet achieves 
      97.86% accuracy, exceeding multiple notable SoTA healthcare risk prediction 
      models. Explainability at Both Local and Global Level The framework offers 
      explainability at local (using various matrix heatmaps for diagnosing models, 
      such as force plots, SHAP summary visualizations, and confusion matrix-based 
      diagnostics) and also at a global level through feature importance plots and 
      Top-N list visualizations. As a result, we show quantitative results, 
      demonstrating that much of the improvement can be achieved without paying a high 
      price for interpretability. We have proposed a cost-effective and systematic 
      approach as an AI-based platform that is scalable, accurate, transparent, and 
      interpretable for critical care and personalized diagnostics. PersonalCareNet, by 
      filling the void between performance and interpretability, promises a significant 
      advancement in the field of reliable and clinically validated predictive 
      healthcare AI. The design allows for additional extension to multiple data types 
      and real-time deployment at the edge, creating a broader impact and adaptability.

AB  - Explainable AI (XAI) methods are gaining prominence in medical imaging, 
      addressing the critical need for transparency and trust in AI-driven diagnostic 
      tools. Mammography, as the cornerstone of early breast cancer detection, holds 
      immense potential for improving outcomes when integrated with AI solutions. 
      However, widespread adoption of AI in clinical settings depends on 
      explainability, which enhances clinicians' confidence in these tools. By 
      exploring various XAI techniques and evaluating their strengths and weaknesses, 
      researchers can significantly advance precision medicine. This review synthesizes 
      existing research on XAI in medical imaging, focusing on mammography, a domain 
      often overlooked in XAI studies. It provides a comparative analysis of XAI 
      techniques employed in mammography, assessing their diagnostic efficacy and 
      identifying research gaps, such as the lack of specialized evaluation frameworks. 
      Additionally, the review examines evaluation methods for XAI in medical imaging 
      and proposes modifications tailored to mammography diagnostics. Insights from XAI 
      advancements in other fields are also explored for their potential to enhance 
      interpretability and clinical relevance in breast cancer detection. The study 
      concludes by highlighting critical research gaps and proposing directions for 
      developing reliable, effective AI models that integrate XAI to transform breast 
      cancer diagnostics.

AB  - Pharmacogenomic variations in genes involved in drug disposition and in drug 
      targets is a major determinant of inter-individual differences in drug response 
      and toxicity. While the effects of common variants are well established, millions 
      of rare variations remain functionally uncharacterized, posing a challenge for 
      the implementation of precision medicine. Recent advances in machine learning 
      (ML) have significantly enhanced the prediction of variant effects by considering 
      DNA as well as protein sequences, as well as their evolutionary conservation and 
      haplotype structures. Emerging deep learning models utilize techniques to capture 
      evolutionary conservation and biophysical properties, and ensemble approaches 
      that integrate multiple predictive models exhibit increased accuracy, robustness, 
      and interpretability. This review explores the current landscape of ML-based 
      variant effect predictors. We discuss key methodological differences and 
      highlight their strengths and limitations for pharmacogenomic applications. We 
      furthermore discuss emerging methodologies for the prediction of 
      substrate-specificity and for consideration of variant epistasis. Combined, these 
      tools improve the functional effect prediction of drug-related variants and offer 
      a viable strategy that could in the foreseeable future translate comprehensive 
      genomic information into pharmacogenetic recommendations.

AB  - Prostate cancer is one of the major health challenges in the world and needs 
      novel therapeutic approaches to overcome the limitations of conventional 
      treatment. This review delineates the transformative potential of artificial 
      intelligence (AL) in enhancing nanocarrier-based drug delivery systems for 
      prostate cancer therapy. With its ability to optimize nanocarrier design and 
      predict drug delivery kinetics, AI has revolutionized personalized treatment 
      planning in oncology. We discuss how AI can be integrated with nanotechnology to 
      address challenges related to tumor heterogeneity, drug resistance, and systemic 
      toxicity. Emphasis is placed on strong AI-driven advancements in the design of 
      nanocarriers, structural optimization, targeting of ligands, and 
      pharmacokinetics. We also give an overview of how AI can better predict toxicity, 
      reduce costs, and enable personalized medicine. While challenges persist in the 
      way of data accessibility, regulatory hurdles, and interactions with the immune 
      system, future directions based on explainable AI (XAI) models, integration of 
      multimodal data, and green nanocarrier designs promise to move the field forward. 
      Convergence between AI and nanotechnology has been one key step toward safer, 
      more effective, and patient-tailored cancer therapy.

TI  - Deep Learning-Based Prediction of Molecular Tumor Biomarkers from H&E: A 
      Practical Review.
LID - 10.3390/jpm12122022 [doi]
LID - 2022
AB  - Molecular and genomic properties are critical in selecting cancer treatments to 
      target individual tumors, particularly for immunotherapy. However, the methods to 
      assess such properties are expensive, time-consuming, and often not routinely 
      performed. Applying machine learning to H&E images can provide a more 
      cost-effective screening method. Dozens of studies over the last few years have 
      demonstrated that a variety of molecular biomarkers can be predicted from H&E 
      alone using the advancements of deep learning: molecular alterations, genomic 
      subtypes, protein biomarkers, and even the presence of viruses. This article 
      reviews the diverse applications across cancer types and the methodology to train 
      and validate these models on whole slide images. From bottom-up to 
      pathologist-driven to hybrid approaches, the leading trends include a variety of 
      weakly supervised deep learning-based approaches, as well as mechanisms for 
      training strongly supervised models in select situations. While results of these 
      algorithms look promising, some challenges still persist, including small 
      training sets, rigorous validation, and model explainability. Biomarker 
      prediction models may yield a screening method to determine when to run molecular 
      tests or an alternative when molecular tests are not possible. They also create 
      new opportunities in quantifying intratumoral heterogeneity and predicting 
      patient outcomes.

TI  - Understanding the impact of radiotherapy fractionation on overall survival in a 
      large head and neck squamous cell carcinoma dataset: a comprehensive approach 
      combining mechanistic and machine learning models.
PG  - 1422211
LID - 10.3389/fonc.2024.1422211 [doi]
LID - 1422211
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Treating head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), especially 
      human papillomavirus negative (HPV-) and locally advanced cases, remains 
      difficult. Our previous analyses of radiotherapy-only HNSCC clinical trials data 
      using mechanistically-motivated models of tumor repopulation and killing by 
      radiotherapy predicted that hyperfractionation with twice-daily fractions, or 
      hypofractionation involving increased doses/fraction and reduced treatment 
      durations, both improve tumor control and reduce late normal tissue toxicity, 
      compared with standard protocols using 35×2 Gy. Here we further investigated the 
      validity of these conclusions by analyzing a large modern dataset on 3,346 HNSCC 
      radiotherapy patients from the University Health Network in Toronto, Canada, 
      where 42.5% of patients were also treated with chemotherapy. METHODS: We used a 
      two-step approach that combines mechanistic modeling concepts with 
      state-of-the-art machine learning, beginning with Random Survival Forests (RSF) 
      for an exploratory analysis and followed by Causal Survival Forests (CSF) for a 
      focused causal analysis. The mechanistic concept of biologically effective dose 
      (BED) was implemented for the standard dose-independent (DI) tumor repopulation 
      model, our alternative dose-dependent (DD) repopulation model, and a simple model 
      with no repopulation (BED(simp)). These BED variants were included in the RSF 
      model, along with age, stage, HPV status and other relevant variables, to predict 
      patient overall survival (OS) and cause-specific mortality (deaths from the index 
      cancer, other cancers or other causes). RESULTS: Model interpretation using 
      Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) values and correlation matrices showed that 
      high values of BED(DD) or BED(DI), but not BED(simp), were associated with 
      decreased patient mortality. Targeted causal inference analyses were then 
      performed using CSF to estimate the causal effect of each BED variant on OS. They 
      revealed that high BED(DD) (>61.8 Gy) or BED(DI) (>57.6 Gy), but not BED(simp), 
      increased patient restricted mean survival time (RMST) by 0.5-1.0 years and 
      increased survival probability (SP) by 5-15% several years after treatment. In 
      addition to population-level averages, CSF generated individual-level causal 
      effect estimates for each patient, facilitating personalized medicine. 
      DISCUSSION: These findings are generally consistent with those of our previous 
      mechanistic modeling, implying the potential benefits of altered radiotherapy 
      fractionation schemes (e.g. 25×2.4 Gy, 20×2.75 Gy, 18×3.0 Gy) which increase 
      BED(DD) and BED(DI) and counteract tumor repopulation more effectively than 
      standard fractionation. Such regimens may represent potentially useful 
      hypofractionated options for treating HNSCC.

AB  - Brain diseases pose a significant global health challenge due to their complexity 
      and the limitations of traditional medical strategies. Recent advancements in 
      artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep learning models like Convolutional 
      Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Graph Neural 
      Networks (GNNs), offer powerful new tools for analysis. These neural networks are 
      effective at extracting complex patterns from high-dimensional data. By 
      integrating diverse data sources-such as neuroimaging, multi-omics, and clinical 
      information-multimodal AI provides the comprehensive view needed to understand 
      intricate disease mechanisms. This review outlines how these technologies enhance 
      precision drug development and enable closed-loop treatment systems for brain 
      disorders. Key applications include improving diagnostic accuracy, identifying 
      novel biomarkers, accelerating drug discovery through target identification and 
      virtual screening, and predicting patient-specific treatment responses. These 
      AI-driven methods have the potential to shift medicine from a one-size-fits-all 
      model to a personalized approach, with diagnostics and therapies tailored to 
      individual profiles. However, realizing this potential requires addressing 
      significant challenges related to data access, model interpretability, clinical 
      validation, and practical integration.

AB  - Childhood obesity is a growing global health concern as it is correlated with an 
      increased risk of adult-onset and chronic diseases. Recent advances in digital 
      healthcare technologies have enhanced the efficiency of health data analysis and 
      diagnosis, leading to increased interest in artificial intelligence (AI) 
      applications in childhood obesity research; however, several challenges remain, 
      such as data limitations, class-imbalance issues, and difficulties in model 
      interpretability. This study addresses these challenges through a comprehensive 
      framework that utilizes wearable devices for real-time lifestyle data collection 
      and employs Wasserstein generative adversarial networks (WGANs) to address data 
      imbalance concerns. The proposed framework incorporates an explainable model 
      architecture combining tabular attention network (TabNet) with eXtreme Gradient 
      Boosting (XGBoost), complemented by SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis 
      for enhanced interpretability. The framework was validated using data collected 
      from 362 elementary school students over six months, with an additional external 
      validation set of 82 students. The results demonstrated exceptional performance 
      with 98.0% accuracy on the test dataset and 85.2% accuracy on the external 
      validation data. Therefore, the framework can provide personalized health 
      guidance by identifying and explaining individual factors that contribute to 
      weight change, thereby enabling targeted intervention strategies for childhood 
      obesity prevention.

AB  - This study introduces a machine learning (ML)-based platform aimed at predicting 
      the effectiveness of Metacognitive Training (MCT). The platform is meant to 
      function as an experimental prototype in the scope of a clinical research project 
      for a decision support system to assist clinicians in tailoring treatment plans 
      for patients with psychosis. It integrates eight ML models to evaluate MCT 
      effectiveness under a wide range of mental health questionnaires to assess a 
      broad spectrum of psychological symptoms. By incorporating diverse measures, the 
      platform aims to capture a comprehensive understanding of patient profiles, 
      enabling more precise and tailored predictions for treatment personalization. 
      Furthermore, the transparency requirements for artificial intelligence (AI) 
      systems, as outlined in the AI Act regulation of the European Union, are 
      addressed through the implementation of explainable AI models, using post-hoc 
      explanations based on SHAP analysis for each predictive model. Ethical concerns 
      related to ensuring gender-neutral behavior in the system are tackled by 
      conducting a disparate impact analysis, which evaluates biases present in the 
      models enhancing the system's accountability and alignment with ethical and 
      regulatory standards.

AB  - The deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing 
      neuropharmacology and drug development, allowing the modulation of 
      neurotransmitter systems at the personal level. This review focuses on the 
      neuropharmacology and regulation of neurotransmitters using predictive modeling, 
      closed-loop neuromodulation, and precision drug design. The fusion of AI with 
      applications such as machine learning, deep-learning, and even computational 
      modeling allows for the real-time tracking and enhancement of biological 
      processes within the body. An exemplary application of AI is the use of 
      DeepMind's AlphaFold to design new GABA reuptake inhibitors for epilepsy and 
      anxiety. Likewise, Benevolent AI and IBM Watson have fast-tracked drug 
      repositioning for neurodegenerative conditions. Furthermore, we identified new 
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors for depression through AI screening. In addition, 
      the application of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) settings using AI for patients 
      with Parkinson's disease and for patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) 
      using reinforcement learning-based transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) leads 
      to better treatment. This review highlights other challenges including algorithm 
      bias, ethical concerns, and limited clinical validation. Their proposal to 
      incorporate AI with optogenetics, CRISPR, neuroprosthesis, and other advanced 
      technologies fosters further exploration and refinement of precision 
      neurotherapeutic approaches. By bridging computational neuroscience with clinical 
      applications, AI has the potential to revolutionize neuropharmacology and improve 
      patient-specific treatment strategies. We addressed critical challenges, such as 
      algorithmic bias and ethical concerns, by proposing bias auditing, diverse 
      datasets, explainable AI, and regulatory frameworks as practical solutions to 
      ensure equitable and transparent AI applications in neurotransmitter modulation.

TI  - Automated Machine Learning in Dentistry: A Narrative Review of Applications, 
      Challenges, and Future Directions.

LID - 273
AB  - The adoption of automated machine learning (AutoML) in dentistry is transforming 
      clinical practices by enabling clinicians to harness machine learning (ML) models 
      without requiring extensive technical expertise. This narrative review aims to 
      explore the impact of autoML in dental applications. A comprehensive search of 
      PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar was conducted without time and language 
      restrictions. Inclusion criteria focused on studies evaluating autoML 
      applications and performance for dental tasks. Exclusion criteria included 
      non-dental studies, single-case reports, and conference abstracts. This review 
      highlights multiple promising applications of autoML in dentistry. Diagnostic 
      tasks showed high accuracy, such as 95.4% precision in dental implant 
      classification and 92% accuracy in paranasal sinus disease detection. Predictive 
      tasks also demonstrated promise, including 84% accuracy for ICU admissions due to 
      dental infections and 93.9% accuracy in orthodontic extraction predictions. 
      AutoML frameworks like Google Vertex AI and H2O AutoML emerged as key tools for 
      these applications. AutoML shows great promise in transforming dentistry by 
      facilitating data-driven decision-making and improving patient care quality 
      through accessible, automated solutions. Future advancements should focus on 
      enhancing model interpretability, developing large and annotated datasets, and 
      creating pipelines tailored to dental tasks. Educating clinicians on autoML and 
      integrating domain-specific knowledge into automated platforms could further 
      bridge the gap between complex ML technology and practical dental applications.

AB  - The field of bioinformatics now depends heavily on AI technology that will modify 
      the current state of medical practices alongside scientific research. The sorting 
      and analysis of large biological data sets benefit from Original Artificial 
      Intelligence and its subcategories including machine learning and deep learning 
      which previously struggled with data interpretation. This review evaluates the 
      fundamental AI enabled bioinformatics approaches with their deployment for 
      genomic and protein structure prediction and drug discovery algorithms and 
      diagnostic solutions. Different AI models demonstrate exceptional ability to 
      identify genetic disease-related mutations and to forecast protein structure in 
      addition to accelerating pharmaceutical research while enhancing diagnosis 
      reliability. Even so various issues related to data quality together with unclear 
      model interpretability and ethical considerations persist. AI-generated 
      bioinformatics continues to form an emerging field that holds transformative 
      potential in the areas of precision medicine together with multiomics analyses 
      and precision health systems. AI technology will continue to evolve in future, 
      thus transforming bioinformatics while solving modern biological and healthcare 
      problems.

AB  - In the 20(th) century, many advances in biological knowledge and evidence-based 
      medicine were supported by p values and accompanying methods. In the early 21(st) 
      century, ambitions toward precision medicine place a premium on detailed 
      predictions for single individuals. The shift causes tension between traditional 
      regression methods used to infer statistically significant group differences and 
      burgeoning predictive analysis tools suited to forecast an individual's future. 
      Our comparison applies linear models for identifying significant contributing 
      variables and for finding the most predictive variable sets. In systematic data 
      simulations and common medical datasets, we explored how variables identified as 
      significantly relevant and variables identified as predictively relevant can 
      agree or diverge. Across analysis scenarios, even small predictive performances 
      typically coincided with finding underlying significant statistical 
      relationships, but not vice versa. More complete understanding of different ways 
      to define "important" associations is a prerequisite for reproducible research 
      and advances toward personalizing medical care.

TI  - Leveraging machine learning for precision medicine: a predictive model for 
      cognitive impairment in cholestasis patients.
PG  - 185
LID - 10.1186/s12876-025-03711-7 [doi]
LID - 185
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cholestasis, characterized by impaired bile flow, impacts cognitive 
      function through systemic mechanisms, including inflammation and metabolic 
      dysregulation. Despite its significance, targeted predictive models for cognitive 
      impairment in cholestasis remain underexplored. This study addresses this gap by 
      developing a machine learning-based predictive model tailored to this population. 
      METHODS: Clinical and biochemical data from Qingyang People's Hospital 
      (2021-2023) were used to train and validate models for predicting cognitive 
      impairment (MoCA ≤ 17). Recursive feature elimination identified critical 
      predictors, while LightGBM and other machine learning models were evaluated. SHAP 
      analysis enhanced model interpretability, and clinical utility was assessed 
      through decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS: LightGBM outperformed other 
      models with an AUC of 0.7955 on the testing dataset. Age, plasma D-dimer, and 
      albumin were key predictors. SHAP analysis revealed non-linear interactions among 
      features, demonstrating the model's clinical alignment. DCA confirmed its utility 
      in improving patient stratification. CONCLUSION: The developed LightGBM-based 
      model effectively predicts cognitive impairment in cholestasis patients, 
      providing actionable insights for early intervention. Integrating this tool into 
      clinical workflows can enhance precision medicine and improve outcomes in this 
      high-risk population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Digital twin technology heralds a transformative era in 
      Otorhinolaryngology (ORL), merging the physical and digital worlds to offer 
      dynamic, virtual models of physical entities or processes. PURPOSE: These models, 
      capable of simulating, predicting, and optimizing real-world counterparts, are 
      evolving from static replicas to intelligent, adaptive systems. METHODS: Fueled 
      by advancements in communication, sensor technology, big data analytics, Internet 
      of Things (IoT), and simulation technologies, artificial intelligence (AI), 
      digital twins in ORL promise personalized treatment planning, virtual 
      experimentation, and therapeutic intervention optimization. Despite their 
      potential, the integration of digital twins in ORL faces challenges including 
      data privacy and security, data integration and interoperability, computational 
      demands, model validation and accuracy, ethical and regulatory considerations, 
      patient engagement, and cost and accessibility issues. RESULTS: Overcoming these 
      challenges requires robust data protection measures, seamless data integration, 
      substantial computational resources, rigorous validation studies, ethical 
      transparency, patient education, and making the technology accessible and 
      affordable. Looking ahead, the future of digital twins in ORL is bright, with 
      advancements in AI and machine learning, omics data integration, real-time 
      monitoring, virtual clinical trials, patient empowerment, seamless healthcare 
      integration, longitudinal data analysis, and collaborative research. CONCLUSION: 
      These developments promise to refine diagnostic and treatment strategies, enhance 
      patient care, and facilitate more efficient and tailored ORL research, ultimately 
      leading to more effective and personalized ORL management.

TI  - The Effectiveness of a Hybrid Exercise Program on the Physical Fitness of Frail 
      Elderly.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph191711063 [doi]
LID - 11063
AB  - BACKGROUND: Frailty is a serious physical disorder affecting the elderly all over 
      the world. However, the frail elderly have low physical fitness, which limits the 
      effectiveness of current exercise programs. Inspired by this, we attempted to 
      integrate Baduanjin and strength and endurance exercises into an exercise program 
      to improve the physical fitness and alleviate frailty among the elderly. 
      Additionally, to achieve the goals of personalized medicine, machine learning 
      simulations were performed to predict post-intervention frailty. METHODS: A total 
      of 171 frail elderly individuals completed the experiment, including a Baduanjin 
      group (BDJ), a strength and endurance training group (SE), and a combination of 
      Baduanjin and strength and endurance training group (BDJSE), which lasted for 24 
      weeks. Physical fitness was evaluated by 10-meter maximum walk speed (10 m MWS), 
      grip strength, the timed up-and-go test (TUGT), and the 6 min walk test (6 min 
      WT). A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), chi-square test, and two-way 
      repeated-measures ANOVA were carried out to analyze the experimental data. In 
      addition, nine machine learning models were utilized to predict the frailty 
      status after the intervention. RESULTS: In 10 m MWS and TUGT, there was a 
      significant interactive influence between group and time. When comparing the BDJ 
      group and the SE group, participants in the BDJSE group demonstrated the maximum 
      gains in 10 m MWS and TUGT after 24 weeks of intervention. The stacking model 
      surpassed other algorithms in performance. The accuracy and precision rates were 
      75.5% and 77.1%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The hybrid exercise program that 
      combined Baduanjin with strength and endurance training proved more effective at 
      improving fitness and reversing frailty in elderly individuals. Based on the 
      stacking model, it is possible to predict whether an elderly person will exhibit 
      reversed frailty following an exercise program.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The task of identifying patient subgroups with enhanced treatment 
      responses is important for clinical drug development. However, existing deep 
      learning-based approaches often struggle to provide clear biological insights. 
      This study aims to develop a deep learning method that not only captures 
      treatment effect differences among individuals but also helps uncover meaningful 
      biological markers associated with those differences. METHODS: We introduce 
      DeepRAB, a deep learning-based framework designed for exploring treatment effect 
      heterogeneity by constructing individualized treatment rule (ITR). In addition, 
      DeepRAB enables model interpretability by facilitating predictive biomarker 
      identification. We evaluate its performance using simulated datasets that vary in 
      complexity, treatment effect strength, and sample size. We also apply the method 
      to the adalimumab (Humira, AbbVie) hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) clinical trial 
      data, analyzing patient characteristics and treatment outcomes. RESULTS: In 
      analyses of simulated data under various scenarios, our findings show the 
      effective performance of DeepRAB for subgroup exploration, and its capability to 
      uncover predictive biomarkers when compared to existing approaches. When applied 
      to the real clinical trial data, DeepRAB demonstrates its practical usage in 
      identifying important predictive biomarkers and boosting model prediction 
      performance. CONCLUSIONS: Our research provides a promising approach for subgroup 
      identification and predictive biomarker discovery by leveraging deep learning. 
      This approach may support more targeted treatment strategies in clinical research 
      and enhance decision-making in personalized medicine.

OAB - In order to improve healthcare, matching patients to effective treatment plans is 
      needed. This study aims to find better ways to identify groups of patients who 
      respond well to certain treatments. We develop a new method called DeepRAB, which 
      uses artificial intelligence to find these patient groups and identify important 
      biomarkers that can predict treatment response. We test DeepRAB using simulated 
      data and real patient data from a clinical trial studying a skin condition called 
      hidradenitis suppurativa. The results show that DeepRAB is successful in 
      identifying meaningful patient groupings and performs better than existing 
      methods. This new approach has the potential to help doctors choose the best 
      treatment options for individual patients, making healthcare more personalized 
      and effective.

AB  - PURPOSE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a global health concern, marked 
      by increasing incidence rates and poor outcomes. This study seeks to develop a 
      robust predictive model by integrating radiomics and deep learning features with 
      clinical data to predict 2-year survival in HCC patients treated with 
      stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). METHODS: This study analyzed a cohort 
      of 186 HCC patients who underwent SBRT. Radiomics features were extracted from CT 
      scans, complemented by collection of clinical data. Training and validation of 
      machine learning models were conducted using nested cross-validation techniques. 
      Deep learning models, leveraging various convolutional neural networks (CNNs), 
      were employed to effectively integrate both image and clinical data. Post-hoc 
      explainability techniques were applied to elucidate the contribution of imaging 
      data to predictive outcomes. RESULTS: Handcrafted radiomics features demonstrated 
      moderate predictive performance, with area under the receiver operating 
      characteristic curve (AUC) values ranging from 0.59 to 0.72. Deep learning 
      models, harnessing the fusion of image and clinical data, exhibited improved 
      predictive accuracy, with AUC values ranging from 0.71 to 0.81. Notably, the 
      ensemble model, amalgamating handcrafted radiomics and deep learning features 
      with clinical data, demonstrated the most robust predictive capability, achieving 
      an AUC of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.80-0.93). CONCLUSION: The ensemble model represents a 
      significant advancement, providing a comprehensive tool for predicting survival 
      outcomes in HCC patients undergoing SBRT. The inclusion of interpretability 
      methods such as Grad-CAM enhances transparency and understanding of these complex 
      predictive models.

AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To construct and validate an interpretable machine 
      learning (ML) radiomics model derived from multiparametric magnetic resonance 
      imaging (MRI) images to differentiate between luminal and non-luminal breast 
      cancer (BC) subtypes. METHODS: This study enrolled 1098 BC participants from four 
      medical centers, categorized into a training cohort (n = 580) and validation 
      cohorts 1-3 (n = 252, 89, and 177, respectively). Multiparametric MRI-based 
      radiomics features, including T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), T2-weighted imaging 
      (T2WI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), 
      and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging, were extracted. Five ML algorithms 
      were applied to develop various radiomics models, from which the best performing 
      model was identified. A ML-based combined model including optimal radiomics 
      features and clinical predictors was constructed, with performance assessed 
      through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The Shapley additive 
      explanation (SHAP) method was utilized to assess model interpretability. RESULTS: 
      Tumor size and MR-reported lymph node status were chosen as significant clinical 
      variables. Thirteen radiomics features were identified from multiparametric MRI 
      images. The extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) radiomics model performed the 
      best, achieving area under the curves (AUCs) of 0.941, 0.903, 0.862, and 0.894 
      across training and validation cohorts 1-3, respectively. The XGBoost combined 
      model showed favorable discriminative power, with AUCs of 0.956, 0.912, 0.894, 
      and 0.906 in training and validation cohorts 1-3, respectively. The SHAP 
      visualization facilitated global interpretation, identifying 
      "ADC_wavelet-HLH_glszm_ZoneEntropy" and "DCE_wavelet-HLL_gldm_DependenceVariance" 
      as the most significant features for the model's predictions. CONCLUSION: The 
      XGBoost combined model derived from multiparametric MRI may proficiently 
      differentiate between luminal and non-luminal BC and aid in treatment 
      decision-making. CRITICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: An interpretable machine learning 
      radiomics model can preoperatively predict luminal and non-luminal subtypes in 
      breast cancer, thereby aiding therapeutic decision-making.

TI  - Deep learning-based six-type classifier for lung cancer and mimics from 
      histopathological whole slide images: a retrospective study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Targeted therapy and immunotherapy put forward higher demands for 
      accurate lung cancer classification, as well as benign versus malignant disease 
      discrimination. Digital whole slide images (WSIs) witnessed the transition from 
      traditional histopathology to computational approaches, arousing a hype of deep 
      learning methods for histopathological analysis. We aimed at exploring the 
      potential of deep learning models in the identification of lung cancer subtypes 
      and cancer mimics from WSIs. METHODS: We initially obtained 741 WSIs from the 
      First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University (SYSUFH) for the deep 
      learning model development, optimization, and verification. Additional 318 WSIs 
      from SYSUFH, 212 from Shenzhen People's Hospital, and 422 from The Cancer Genome 
      Atlas were further collected for multi-centre verification. EfficientNet-B5- and 
      ResNet-50-based deep learning methods were developed and compared using the 
      metrics of recall, precision, F1-score, and areas under the curve (AUCs). A 
      threshold-based tumour-first aggregation approach was proposed and implemented 
      for the label inferencing of WSIs with complex tissue components. Four 
      pathologists of different levels from SYSUFH reviewed all the testing slides 
      blindly, and the diagnosing results were used for quantitative comparisons with 
      the best performing deep learning model. RESULTS: We developed the first deep 
      learning-based six-type classifier for histopathological WSI classification of 
      lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, small cell lung carcinoma, 
      pulmonary tuberculosis, organizing pneumonia, and normal lung. The 
      EfficientNet-B5-based model outperformed ResNet-50 and was selected as the 
      backbone in the classifier. Tested on 1067 slides from four cohorts of different 
      medical centres, AUCs of 0.970, 0.918, 0.963, and 0.978 were achieved, 
      respectively. The classifier achieved high consistence to the ground truth and 
      attending pathologists with high intraclass correlation coefficients over 0.873. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Multi-cohort testing demonstrated our six-type classifier achieved 
      consistent and comparable performance to experienced pathologists and gained 
      advantages over other existing computational methods. The visualization of 
      prediction heatmap improved the model interpretability intuitively. The 
      classifier with the threshold-based tumour-first label inferencing method 
      exhibited excellent accuracy and feasibility in classifying lung cancers and 
      confused nonneoplastic tissues, indicating that deep learning can resolve complex 
      multi-class tissue classification that conforms to real-world histopathological 
      scenarios.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Drug sustainability (DS), a surrogate marker for drug efficacy, is 
      important, especially when aiming for precision medicine. However, it lacks 
      reliable prediction methods. AIMS: To develop and externally validate a web-based 
      artificial intelligence(AI)-derived tool for predicting DS of infliximab and 
      vedolizumab in patients with moderate-to-severe Ulcerative Colitis (UC). METHODS: 
      Data from three Israeli centers included infliximab or vedolizumab patients 
      treated for >54 weeks. Sustainability meant no corticosteroids, hospitalizations 
      or surgeries. Machine learning techniques predicted >54-week and overall DS using 
      baseline clinical data. RESULTS: The model was developed using data from 246 
      patients from Rabin Medical Center and externally validated on 67 patients from 
      Rambam Health Care Campus and Sheba Medical Center. No significant difference in 
      DS was observed across the datasets. Most patients were biologic-naïve and 
      primarily treated with vedolizumab. The model performed well, with an area under 
      the ROC curve of 0.86, and showed good accuracy (65.5 %-76.9 %) across the test 
      sets. CONCLUSIONS: The study introduces a novel, AI-based tool for predicting 
      >54-week DS of infliximab and vedolizumab in moderate-to-severe UC, using 
      baseline parameters. This can aid clinical decision-making in the framework of 
      precision medicine, promising to optimize disease management while maintaining 
      physician autonomy.

      early detection of knee-related pathologies by examining the relationship between 
      knee morphology and demographic factors such as age, gender, and body mass index. 
      Additionally, gender-specific reference values for knee morphological features 
      will be determined using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). METHODS: A 
      retrospective analysis was conducted on the MRI data of 500 healthy knees aged 
      20-40 years. The study included various knee morphological features such as 
      Distal Femoral Width (DFW), Lateral Femoral Condyler Width (LFCW), Intercondylar 
      Femoral Width (IFW), Anterior Cruciate Ligament Width (ACLW), and Anterior 
      Cruciate Ligament Length (ACLL). Machine learning models, including Decision 
      Trees, Random Forests, Light Gradient Boosting, Multilayer Perceptron, and 
      Support Vector Machines, were employed to predict gender based on these features. 
      The SHapley Additive exPlanation was used to analyze feature importance. RESULTS: 
      The learning models demonstrated high classification performance, with 83.2% 
      (±5.15) for classification of clusters based on morphological feature and 88.06% 
      (±4.8) for gender classification. These results validated that the strong 
      correlation between knee morphology and gender. CONCLUSION: The study found that 
      DFW is the most significant feature for gender prediction, with values below 
      78-79 mm range indicating females and values above this range indicating males. 
      LFCW, IFW, ACLW, and ACLL also showed significant gender-based differences. The 
      findings establish gender-specific reference values for knee morphological 
      features, highlighting the impact of gender on knee morphology. These reference 
      values can improve the accuracy of diagnoses and treatment plans tailored to each 
      gender, enhancing personalized medical care.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is significantly advancing precision medicine, 
      particularly in the fields of immunogenomics, radiomics, and pathomics. In 
      immunogenomics, AI can process vast amounts of genomic and multi-omic data to 
      identify biomarkers associated with immunotherapy responses and disease 
      prognosis, thus providing strong support for personalized treatments. In 
      radiomics, AI can analyze high-dimensional features from computed tomography 
      (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography/computed 
      tomography (PET/CT) images to discover imaging biomarkers associated with tumor 
      heterogeneity, treatment response, and disease progression, thereby enabling 
      non-invasive, real-time assessments for personalized therapy. Pathomics leverages 
      AI for deep analysis of digital pathology images, and can uncover subtle changes 
      in tissue microenvironments, cellular characteristics, and morphological 
      features, and offer unique insights into immunotherapy response prediction and 
      biomarker discovery. These AI-driven technologies not only enhance the speed, 
      accuracy, and robustness of biomarker discovery but also significantly improve 
      the precision, personalization, and effectiveness of clinical treatments, and are 
      driving a shift from empirical to precision medicine. Despite challenges such as 
      data quality, model interpretability, integration of multi-modal data, and 
      privacy protection, the ongoing advancements in AI, coupled with 
      interdisciplinary collaboration, are poised to further enhance AI's roles in 
      biomarker discovery and immunotherapy response prediction. These improvements are 
      expected to lead to more accurate, personalized treatment strategies and 
      ultimately better patient outcomes, marking a significant step forward in the 
      evolution of precision medicine.

TI  - Machine learning driven diabetes care using predictive-prescriptive analytics for 
      personalized medication prescription.
PG  - 26811
LID - 10.1038/s41598-025-12310-1 [doi]
LID - 26811
AB  - The increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a significant health 
      concern worldwide. Effective and personalized treatment strategies are essential 
      for improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. Machine learning 
      (ML) has the potential to create clinical decision support systems (CDSS) that 
      assist clinicians in making prediction-informed treatment decisions. This study 
      aims to develop a novel predictive-prescriptive analytics framework that 
      leverages ML to enhance medication prescriptions for T2D patients. The framework 
      is designed as a data-driven CDSS to determine the best medication strategies 
      based on individual patient profiles, including demographics, comorbidities, and 
      medications. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset of electronic health records from 
      17,773 patients across various U.S. Veterans Administration Medical Centers 
      collected over 12 years, the study employs the Bayesian Network (BN) as the ML 
      model of choice. The BN's unique dual capability serves both predictive and 
      prescriptive functions. Several BN learning algorithms are applied to map the 
      relationships among patient features and decision variables for predicting the 
      outcome. The prescriptive stage includes three strategies, i.e., forward, 
      backward, and guideline-based, to identify optimal treatment recommendations. 
      Next, the complex treatment pathways identified through the prescriptive stage 
      were illustrated using rule-based and decision-tree presentations to improve 
      interpretability for actionable insights and clinical usability. Finally, our 
      empirical analysis examines the alignment between recommended treatment 
      strategies and actual physician prescriptions. ML exhibited strong predictive 
      performance with a precision of 0.789, a recall of 0.879, and an F1-score of 
      0.831. The recommended treatment strategies aligned with physician prescriptions 
      in simpler treatment scenarios. However, the alignment decreased as the 
      complexity of medication prescription increased, highlighting the challenges of 
      achieving physician compliance with optimal strategies in complex scenarios. This 
      underscores the greater need for CDSS, particularly in situations involving 
      complex combination therapy. This study presents a novel ML-based CDSS framework 
      for personalized T2D treatment. Leveraging ML, the framework offers a promising 
      approach to optimizing medication prescriptions and improving patient outcomes.

LID - e79662
AB  - Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) remain a major concern to the global society 
      because of the associated risk of rupture and death. Currently, the management of 
      AAAs entails clinical and imaging risk factors, which are not precise and 
      accurate in terms of patient-specific risk assessment. Over the last decade, the 
      utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms 
      has transformed the process of decision-making in the field of medicine by 
      allowing for the creation of personalized models based on the patient's 
      characteristics. This review aims to discuss the current state and future 
      directions of AI in the form of predictive modeling for aortic aneurysms, 
      stressing the versatility and progression of the ML approaches in risk 
      assessment, screening, and prognosis. We expand on the various strategies used in 
      AI-based solutions and the differences between general and specific approaches 
      such as supervised and unsupervised learning, deep learning, and others. 
      Furthermore, we bring forward the problem of incorporating clinical, imaging, and 
      genomic data into AI/ML to improve its predictiveness and applicability to 
      clinical practice. In addition, we discuss the difficulties and prospects of 
      turning the developed AI-based forecasting models into clinical practice, as well 
      as the problems associated with data quality, model explainability, and legal and 
      ethical concerns. This review aims to reveal the opportunities of AI and ML in 
      enhancing the risk assessment and management of AAAs to shift the paradigm of 
      cardiovascular care toward precision medicine.

TI  - Multimodal AI in Biomedicine: Pioneering the Future of Biomaterials, Diagnostics, 
      and Personalized Healthcare.
LID - 10.3390/nano15120895 [doi]
LID - 895
AB  - Multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) is driving a paradigm shift in modern 
      biomedicine by seamlessly integrating heterogeneous data sources such as medical 
      imaging, genomic information, and electronic health records. This review explores 
      the transformative impact of multimodal AI across three pivotal areas: 
      biomaterials science, medical diagnostics, and personalized medicine. In the 
      realm of biomaterials, AI facilitates the design of patient-specific solutions 
      tailored for tissue engineering, drug delivery, and regenerative therapies. 
      Advanced tools like AlphaFold have significantly improved protein structure 
      prediction, enabling the creation of biomaterials with enhanced biological 
      compatibility. In diagnostics, AI systems synthesize multimodal inputs combining 
      imaging, molecular markers, and clinical data-to improve diagnostic precision and 
      support early disease detection. For precision medicine, AI integrates data from 
      wearable technologies, continuous monitoring systems, and individualized health 
      profiles to inform targeted therapeutic strategies. Despite its promise, the 
      integration of AI into clinical practice presents challenges such as ensuring 
      data security, meeting regulatory standards, and promoting algorithmic 
      transparency. Addressing ethical issues including bias and equitable access 
      remains critical. Nonetheless, the convergence of AI and biotechnology continues 
      to shape a future where healthcare is more predictive, personalized, and 
      responsive.

AB  - Early detection of malignant thyroid nodules is crucial for effective treatment, 
      but traditional diagnostic methods face challenges such as variability in expert 
      opinions and limited integration of advanced imaging techniques. This prospective 
      cohort study investigates a novel multimodal approach, integrating traditional 
      methods with advanced machine learning techniques. We studied 181 patients who 
      underwent fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy, each contributing one nodule, 
      resulting in a total of 181 nodules for our analysis. Data collection included 
      sex, age, and ultrasound imaging, which incorporated elastography. Features 
      extracted from these images included Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System 
      (TIRADS) scores, elastography parameters, and radiomic features. The pathological 
      results based on the FNA biopsy, provided by the pathologists, served as our gold 
      standard for nodule classification. Our methodology, termed ELTIRADS, combines 
      these features with interpretable machine learning techniques. Performance 
      evaluation showed that a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier using TIRADS, 
      elastography data, and radiomic features achieved high accuracy (0.92), with 
      sensitivity (0.89), specificity (0.94), precision (0.89), and F1 score (0.89). To 
      enhance interpretability, we used hierarchical clustering, shapley additive 
      explanations (SHAP), and partial dependence plots (PDP). This combined approach 
      holds promise for enhancing the accuracy of thyroid nodule malignancy detection, 
      thereby contributing to advancements in personalized and precision medicine in 
      the field of thyroid cancer research.

TI  - An artificial intelligence and machine learning model for personalized prediction 
      of long-term mitral valve repair durability.
LID - S0022-5223(25)00574-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jtcvs.2025.07.017 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study objective was to compare Random Survival Forest, a machine 
      learning method, with Cox proportional hazards models in predicting long-term 
      mitral valve repair durability, focusing on clinical utility and personalized 
      decision-making. METHODS: We analyzed 444 patients undergoing primary mitral 
      valve repair for degenerative mitral regurgitation (2008-2024). The primary 
      outcome was mitral repair failure, defined as recurrent regurgitation/stenosis or 
      reintervention. Random Survival Forest and penalized Cox proportional hazards 
      models were compared for predictive accuracy and interpretability. A web-based 
      application was created to demonstrate the Random Survival Forest model. RESULTS: 
      The failure end point, mitral repair failure, occurred in 13 individuals (3%) 
      during the study period. Random Survival Forest showed superior discrimination 
      (Concordance index: 0.874 vs 0.796) and identified both coaptation length and 
      early mean mitral gradient as key predictors. Cox proportional hazards identified 
      coaptation length alone, with each 1-mm increase reducing failure by 
      approximately 40%. Random Survival Forest-predicted freedom from mitral repair 
      failure at 5, 10, and 15 years was 94%, 74%, and 51% for coaptation length of 6 
      mm; 98%, 94%, and 91% for 9 mm; and 99%, 98%, and 96% for 12 mm, respectively. 
      Mean gradients of 2 to 5 mm Hg were linked to 90% or greater durability at 5 to 
      10 years, whereas 8 mm Hg predicted worse outcomes (68% at 10 years, 64% at 15 
      years). Random Survival Forest further provided nuanced interpretation of 
      temporal risk patterns and generated patient-specific survival estimates to 
      improve repair durability forecasting. CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning outperforms 
      traditional methods by modeling complex, nonlinear associations and identifying 
      clinically actionable predictors. Integrating machine learning into surgical 
      practice may support more personalized, data-driven mitral repair strategies and 
      improve long-term outcomes.

TI  - Improving management of febrile neutropenia in oncology patients: the role of 
      artificial intelligence and machine learning.
PG  - 179-187
LID - 10.1080/14787210.2024.2322445 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have the 
      potential to revolutionize the management of febrile neutropenia (FN) and drive 
      progress toward personalized medicine. AREAS COVERED: In this review, we detail 
      how the collection of a large number of high-quality data can be used to conduct 
      precise mathematical studies with ML and AI. We explain the foundations of these 
      techniques, covering the fundamentals of supervised and unsupervised learning, as 
      well as the most important challenges, e.g. data quality, 'black box' model 
      interpretation and overfitting. To conclude, we provide detailed examples of how 
      AI and ML have been used to enhance predictions of chemotherapy-induced FN, 
      detection of bloodstream infections (BSIs) and multidrug-resistant (MDR) 
      bacteria, and anticipation of severe complications and mortality. EXPERT OPINION: 
      There is promising potential of implementing accurate AI and ML models whilst 
      managing FN. However, their integration as viable clinical tools poses 
      challenges, including technical and implementation barriers. Improving global 
      accessibility, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, and addressing ethical 
      and security considerations are essential. By overcoming these challenges, we 
      could transform personalized care for patients with FN.

TI  - Brain age prediction from MRI scans in neurodegenerative diseases.
PG  - 316-321
LID - 10.1097/WCO.0000000000001383 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review explores the use of brain age estimation from MRI 
      scans as a biomarker of brain health. With disorders like Alzheimer's and 
      Parkinson's increasing globally, there is an urgent need for early detection 
      tools that can identify at-risk individuals before cognitive symptoms emerge. 
      Brain age offers a noninvasive, quantitative measure of neurobiological ageing, 
      with applications in early diagnosis, disease monitoring, and personalized 
      medicine. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies show that individuals with Alzheimer's, mild 
      cognitive impairment (MCI), and Parkinson's have older brain ages than their 
      chronological age. Longitudinal research indicates that brain-predicted age 
      difference (brain-PAD) rises with disease progression and often precedes 
      cognitive decline. Advances in deep learning and multimodal imaging have improved 
      the accuracy and interpretability of brain age predictions. Moreover, 
      socioeconomic disparities and environmental factors significantly affect brain 
      aging, highlighting the need for inclusive models. SUMMARY: Brain age estimation 
      is a promising biomarker for identify future risk of neurodegenerative disease, 
      monitoring progression, and helping prognosis. Challenges like implementation of 
      standardization, demographic biases, and interpretability remain. Future research 
      should integrate brain age with biomarkers and multimodal imaging to enhance 
      early diagnosis and intervention strategies.

TI  - Towards a unified framework for single-cell -omics-based disease prediction 
      through AI.
PG  - e70290
LID - 10.1002/ctm2.70290 [doi]
LID - e70290
AB  - Single-cell omics has emerged as a powerful tool for elucidating cellular 
      heterogeneity in health and disease. Parallel advances in artificial intelligence 
      (AI), particularly in pattern recognition, feature extraction and predictive 
      modelling, now offer unprecedented opportunities to translate these insights into 
      clinical applications. Here, we propose single-cell -omics-based Disease 
      Predictor through AI (scDisPreAI), a unified framework that leverages AI to 
      integrate single-cell -omics data, enabling robust disease and disease-stage 
      prediction, alongside biomarker discovery. The foundation of scDisPreAI lies in 
      assembling a large, standardised database spanning diverse diseases and multiple 
      disease stages. Rigorous data preprocessing, including normalisation and batch 
      effect correction, ensures that biological rather than technical variation drives 
      downstream models. Machine learning pipelines or deep learning architectures can 
      then be trained in a multi-task fashion, classifying both disease identity and 
      disease stage. Crucially, interpretability techniques such as SHapley Additive 
      exPlanations (SHAP) values or attention weights pinpoint the genes most 
      influential for these predictions, highlighting biomarkers that may be shared 
      across diseases or disease stages. By consolidating predictive modelling with 
      interpretable biomarker identification, scDisPreAI may be deployed as a clinical 
      decision assistant, flagging potential therapeutic targets for drug repurposing 
      and guiding tailored treatments. In this editorial, we propose the technical and 
      methodological roadmap for scDisPreAI and emphasises future directions, including

TI  - An explainable machine learning model to solid adnexal masses diagnosis based on 
      clinical data and qualitative ultrasound indicators.
PG  - e7425

AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate characterization of newly diagnosed a solid adnexal lesion 
      is a key step in defining the most appropriate therapeutic approach. Despite 
      guidance from the International Ovarian Tumor Analyzes Panel, the evaluation of 
      these lesions can be challenging. Recent studies have demonstrated how machine 
      learning techniques can be applied to clinical data to solve this diagnostic 
      problem. However, ML models can often consider as black-boxes due to the 
      difficulty of understanding the decision-making process used by the algorithm to 
      obtain a specific result. AIMS: For this purpose, we propose an Explainable 
      Artificial Intelligence model trained on clinical characteristics and qualitative 
      ultrasound indicators to predict solid adnexal masses diagnosis. MATERIALS & 
      METHODS: Since the diagnostic task was a three-class problem (benign tumor, 
      invasive cancer, or ovarian metastasis), we proposed a waterfall classification 
      model: a first model was trained and validated to discriminate benign versus 
      malignant, a second model was trained to distinguish nonmetastatic versus 
      metastatic malignant lesion which occurs when a patient is predicted to be 
      malignant by the first model. Firstly, a stepwise feature selection procedure was 
      implemented. The classification performances were validated on Leave One Out 
      scheme. RESULTS: The accuracy of the three-class model reaches an overall 
      accuracy of 86.36%, and the precision per-class of the benign, nonmetastatic 
      malignant, and metastatic malignant classes were 86.96%, 87.27%, and 77.78%, 
      respectively. DISCUSSION: SHapley Additive exPlanations were performed to 
      visually show how the machine learning model made a specific decision. For each 
      patient, the SHAP values expressed how each characteristic contributed to the 
      classification result. Such information represents an added value for the 
      clinical usability of a diagnostic system. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first work 
      that attempts to design an explainable machine-learning tool for the histological 
      diagnosis of solid masses of the ovary.

AB  - The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) 
      represents a transformative advancement in the early detection and management of 
      biliopancreatic lesions. This review highlights the current state of AI-enhanced 
      EUS (AI-EUS) for diagnosing solid and cystic pancreatic lesions, as well as 
      biliary diseases. AI-driven models, including machine learning (ML) and deep 
      learning (DL), have shown significant improvements in diagnostic accuracy, 
      particularly in distinguishing pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from 
      benign conditions and in the characterization of pancreatic cystic neoplasms. 
      Advanced algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), enable precise 
      image analysis, real-time lesion classification, and integration with clinical 
      and genomic data for personalized care. In biliary diseases, AI-assisted systems 
      enhance bile duct visualization and streamline diagnostic workflows, minimizing 
      operator dependency. Emerging applications, such as AI-guided EUS fine-needle 
      aspiration (FNA) and biopsy (FNB), improve diagnostic yields while reducing 
      errors. Despite these advancements, challenges remain, including data 
      standardization, model interpretability, and ethical concerns regarding data 
      privacy. Future developments aim to integrate multimodal imaging, real-time 
      procedural support, and predictive analytics to further refine the diagnostic and 
      therapeutic potential of AI-EUS. AI-driven innovation in EUS stands poised to 
      revolutionize pancreatico-biliary diagnostics, facilitating earlier detection, 
      enhancing precision, and paving the way for personalized medicine in 
      gastrointestinal oncology and beyond.

TI  - Applications of artificial intelligence in abdominal imaging.
LID - 10.1007/s00261-025-04990-0 [doi]
AB  - The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) carry the promise to 
      reshape abdominal imaging by offering transformative solutions to challenges in 
      disease detection, classification, and personalized care. AI applications, 
      particularly those leveraging deep learning and radiomics, have demonstrated 
      remarkable accuracy in detecting a wide range of abdominal conditions, including 
      but not limited to diffuse liver parenchymal disease, focal liver lesions, 
      pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), renal tumors, and bowel pathologies. 
      These models excel in the automation of tasks such as segmentation, 
      classification, and prognostication across modalities like ultrasound, CT, and 
      MRI, often surpassing traditional diagnostic methods. Despite these advancements, 
      widespread adoption remains limited by challenges such as data heterogeneity, 
      lack of multicenter validation, reliance on retrospective single-center studies, 
      and the "black box" nature of many AI models, which hinder interpretability and 
      clinician trust. The absence of standardized imaging protocols and reference gold 
      standards further complicates integration into clinical workflows. To address 
      these barriers, future directions emphasize collaborative multi-center efforts to 
      generate diverse, standardized datasets, integration of explainable AI frameworks 
      to existing picture archiving and communication systems, and the development of 
      automated, end-to-end pipelines capable of processing multi-source data. Targeted 
      clinical applications, such as early detection of PDAC, improved segmentation of 
      renal tumors, and improved risk stratification in liver diseases, show potential 
      to refine diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic planning. Ethical considerations, 
      such as data privacy, regulatory compliance, and interdisciplinary collaboration, 
      are essential for successful translation into clinical practice. AI's 
      transformative potential in abdominal imaging lies not only in complementing 
      radiologists but also in fostering precision medicine by enabling faster, more 
      accurate, and patient-centered care. Overcoming current limitations through 
      innovation and collaboration will be pivotal in realizing AI's full potential to 
      improve patient outcomes and redefine the landscape of abdominal radiology.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Machine Learning (ML) is transforming medical research by enhancing 
      diagnostic accuracy, predicting disease progression, and personalizing 
      treatments. While general models trained on large datasets identify broad 
      patterns across populations, the diversity of human biology, shaped by genetics, 
      environment, and lifestyle, often limits their effectiveness. This has driven a 
      shift towards subject-specific models that incorporate individual biological and 
      clinical data for more precise predictions and personalized care. However, 
      developing these models presents significant practical and financial challenges. 
      Additionally, ML models initialized through stochastic processes with random 
      seeds can suffer from reproducibility issues when those seeds are changed, 
      leading to variations in predictive performance and feature importance. To 
      address this, this study introduces a novel validation approach to enhance model 
      interpretability, stabilizing predictive performance and feature importance at 
      both the group and subject-specific levels. METHODS: We conducted initial 
      experiments using a single Random Forest (RF) model initialized with a random 
      seed for key stochastic processes, on nine datasets that varied in domain 
      problems, sample size, and demographics. Different validation techniques were 
      applied to assess model accuracy and reproducibility while evaluating feature 
      importance consistency. Next, the experiment was repeated for each dataset for up 
      to 400 trials per subject, randomly seeding the machine learning algorithm 
      between each trial. This introduced variability in the initialization of model 
      parameters, thus providing a more comprehensive evaluation of the machine 
      learning model's features and performance consistency. The repeated trials 
      generated up to 400 feature sets per subject. By aggregating feature importance 
      rankings across trials, our method identified the most consistently important 
      features, reducing the impact of noise and random variation in feature selection. 
      The top subject-specific feature importance set across all trials was then 
      identified. Finally, using all subject-specific feature sets, the top 
      group-specific feature importance set was also created. This process resulted in 
      stable, reproducible feature rankings, enhancing both subject-level and 
      group-level model explainability. RESULTS: We found that machine learning models 
      with stochastic initialization were particularly susceptible to variations in 
      reproducibility, predictive accuracy, and feature importance due to random seed 
      selection and validation techniques during training. Changes in random seeds 
      altered weight initialization, optimization paths, and feature rankings, leading 
      to fluctuations in test accuracy and interpretability. These findings align with 
      prior research on the sensitivity of stochastic models to initialization 
      randomness. This study builds on that understanding by introducing a novel 
      repeated trials validation approach with random seed variation, significantly 
      reducing variability in feature rankings and improving the consistency of model 
      performance metrics. The method enabled robust identification of key features for 
      each subject using a single, generic machine learning model, making predictions 
      more interpretable and stable across experiments. CONCLUSION: Subject-specific 
      models improve generalization by addressing variability in human biology but are 
      often costly and impractical for clinical trials. In this study, we introduce a 
      novel validation technique for determining both group- and subject-specific 
      feature importance within a general machine learning model, achieving greater 
      stability in feature selection, higher predictive accuracy, and improved model 
      interpretability. Our proposed approach ensures reproducible accuracy metrics and 
      reliable feature rankings when using models incorporating stochastic processes, 
      making machine learning models more robust and clinically applicable.

AB  - Quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) provides a mechanistic framework for 
      integrating diverse biological, physiological, and pharmacological data to 
      predict drug interactions and clinical outcomes. Recent advances in artificial 
      intelligence (AI) might transform QSP by enhancing model generation, parameter 
      estimation, and predictive capabilities. AI-driven databases and cloud-based 
      platforms might support QSP model development and facilitate QSP as a service 
      (QSPaaS). However, challenges such as computational complexity, high 
      dimensionality, explainability, data integration, and regulatory acceptance 
      persist. This review critically evaluates the integration of AI within QSP, 
      highlighting novel methodologies like surrogate modeling, virtual patient 
      generation, and digital twin technologies. It also discusses current limitations 
      and outlines strategies for future integration to enhance precision medicine, 
      regulatory acceptability, and mechanistic interpretability in drug discovery and 
      development.

TI  - Personalization of Medical Treatment Decisions: Simplifying Complex Models while 
      Maintaining Patient Health Outcomes.
PG  - 450-460
LID - 10.1177/0272989X211037921 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Personalizing medical treatments based on patient-specific risks and 
      preferences can improve patient health. However, models to support personalized 
      treatment decisions are often complex and difficult to interpret, limiting their 
      clinical application. METHODS: We present a new method, using machine learning to 
      create meta-models, for simplifying complex models for personalizing medical 
      treatment decisions. We consider simple interpretable models, interpretable 
      ensemble models, and noninterpretable ensemble models. We use variable selection 
      with a penalty for patient-specific risks and/or preferences that are difficult, 
      risky, or costly to obtain. We interpret the meta-models to the extent permitted 
      by their model architectures. We illustrate our method by applying it to simplify 
      a previously developed model for personalized selection of antipsychotic drugs 
      for patients with schizophrenia. RESULTS: The best simplified interpretable, 
      interpretable ensemble, and noninterpretable ensemble models contained at most 
      half the number of patient-specific risks and preferences compared with the 
      original model. The simplified models achieved 60.5% (95% credible interval 
      [crI]: 55.2-65.4), 60.8% (95% crI: 55.5-65.7), and 83.8% (95% crI: 80.8-86.6), 
      respectively, of the net health benefit of the original model (quality-adjusted 
      life-years gained). Important variables in all models were similar and made 
      intuitive sense. Computation time for the meta-models was orders of magnitude 
      less than for the original model. LIMITATIONS: The simplified models share the 
      limitations of the original model (e.g., potential biases). CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      meta-modeling method is disease- and model- agnostic and can be used to simplify 
      complex models for personalization, allowing for variable selection in addition 
      to improved model interpretability and computational performance. Simplified 
      models may be more likely to be adopted in clinical settings and can help improve 
      equity in patient outcomes.

      electrocardiography?].
PG  - 635-646
LID - 10.1714/4542.45427 [doi]
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is redefining ECG interpretation, transforming it 
      from a static diagnostic tool into a dynamic, predictive, and integrative 
      instrument. Although widespread, traditional rule-based ECG analysis has 
      limitations in accuracy and adaptability, especially in complex clinical 
      settings. In contrast, AI-driven models, particularly those employing machine 
      learning and deep learning architectures, have demonstrated improved diagnostic 
      performance across a broad spectrum of cardiovascular diseases, including atrial 
      fibrillation, acute myocardial infarction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and 
      valvular heart disease. Notably, AI-ECG is now able to detect subclinical 
      ventricular dysfunction, stratify long-term risk, and anticipate major adverse 
      events before overt clinical manifestations occur. In addition to diagnosis, 
      AI-ECG is emerging as a decision support tool in scenarios characterized by 
      diagnostic uncertainty, such as syncope and cardio-oncology, and may 
      significantly optimize triage and resource allocation. Multiparametric approaches 
      further extend its utility, enabling simultaneous prediction of structural, 
      functional, and electrical cardiac parameters. Wearable devices integrated with 
      AI improve continuous monitoring and may decentralize arrhythmia detection and 
      sudden cardiac death prevention. Despite these advances, critical challenges 
      remain. Poorly explainable AI models, algorithmic bias, overfitting, data 
      governance, and regulatory uncertainty demand rigorous methodological scrutiny. 
      In this framework, federated learning architectures may enable continuous 
      multicenter model refinement and enhance methodological robustness while 
      safeguarding data privacy. The European AI Act and methodological checklists 
      promoted by scientific societies offer a framework to address these issues, 
      fostering transparency, equity, and clinical validity. If validated and 
      implemented responsibly, AI-enhanced ECG has the potential to enhance - not 
      replace - clinical reasoning, advancing a precision medicine paradigm based on 
      both technological innovation and human expertise.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Tinnitus is a neuropathological condition that results 
      in mild buzzing or ringing of the ears without an external sound source. Current 
      tinnitus diagnostic methods often rely on subjective assessment and require 
      intricate medical examinations. This study aimed to propose an interpretable 
      tinnitus diagnostic framework using auditory late response (ALR) and 
      electroencephalogram (EEG), inspired by the gap-prepulse inhibition (GPI) 
      paradigm. METHODS: We collected spontaneous EEG and ALR data from 44 patients 
      with tinnitus and 47 hearing loss-matched controls using specialized hardware to 
      capture responses to sound stimuli with embedded gaps. In this cohort study of 
      tinnitus and control groups, we examined EEG spectral and ALR features of N-P 
      complexes, comparing the responses to gap durations of 50 and 20 ms alongside 
      no-gap conditions. To this end, we developed an interpretable tinnitus diagnostic 
      model using ALR and EEG metrics, boosting machine learning architecture, and 
      explainable feature attribution approaches. RESULTS: Our proposed model achieved 
      90 % accuracy in identifying tinnitus, with an area under the performance curve 
      of 0.89. The explainable artificial intelligence approaches have revealed 
      gap-embedded ALR features such as the GPI ratio of N1-P2 and EEG spectral ratio, 
      which can serve as diagnostic metrics for tinnitus. Our method successfully 
      provides personalized prediction explanations for tinnitus diagnosis using 
      gap-embedded auditory and neurological features. CONCLUSIONS: Deficits in GPI 
      alongside activity in the EEG alpha-beta ratio offer a promising screening tool 
      for assessing tinnitus risk, aligning with current clinical insights from hearing 
      research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) guides the 
      surgeon in ensuring motor pathway integrity during high-risk neurosurgical and 
      orthopedic procedures. Although motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) are valuable for 
      predicting motor outcomes, the key features of predictive signals are not well 
      understood, and standardized warning criteria are lacking. Developing a muscle 
      identification prediction model could increase patient safety while allowing the 
      exploration of relevant features for the task. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study 
      is to expand the development of machine learning (ML) methods for muscle 
      classification and evaluate them in a bicentric setup. Further, we aim to 
      identify key features of MEP signals that contribute to accurate muscle 
      classification using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques. 
      METHODS: This study used ML and deep learning models, specifically random forest 
      (RF) classifiers and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to classify MEP 
      signals from routine supratentorial neurosurgical procedures from two medical 
      centers according to muscle identity of four muscles (extensor digitorum, 
      abductor pollicis brevis, tibialis anterior, and abductor hallucis). The 
      algorithms were trained and validated on a total of 36,992 MEPs from 151 
      surgeries in one center, and they were tested on 24,298 MEPs from 58 surgeries 
      from the other center. Depending on the algorithm, time-series, 
      feature-engineered, and time-frequency representations of the MEP data were used. 
      XAI techniques, specifically Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) values and 
      gradient class activation maps (Grad-CAM), were implemented to identify important 
      signal features. RESULTS: High classification accuracy was achieved with the RF 
      classifier, reaching 87.9% accuracy on the validation set and 80% accuracy on the 
      test set. The 1D- and 2D-CNNs demonstrated comparably strong performance. Our XAI 
      findings indicate that frequency components and peak latencies are crucial for 
      accurate MEP classification, providing insights that could inform intraoperative 
      warning criteria. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the effectiveness of ML 
      techniques and the importance of XAI in enhancing trust in and reliability of 
      artificial intelligence-driven IONM applications. Further, it may help to 
      identify new intrinsic features of MEP signals so far overlooked in conventional 
      warning criteria. By reducing the risk of muscle mislabeling and by providing the 
      basis for possible new warning criteria, this study may help to increase patient 
      safety during surgical procedures.

AB  - BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Numerous factors have been associated with the survival 
      outcomes in patients with spinal cord gliomas (SCG). Recognizing these specific 
      determinants is crucial, yet it is also vital to establish a reliable and precise 
      prognostic model for estimating individual survival outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The 
      objectives of this study are twofold: first, to create an array of interpretable 
      machine learning (ML) models developed for predicting survival outcomes among SCG 
      patients; and second, to integrate these models into an easily navigable online 
      calculator to showcase their prospective clinical applicability. STUDY DESIGN: 
      This was a retrospective, population-based cohort study aiming to predict the 
      outcomes of interest, which were binary categorical variables, in SCG patients 
      with ML models. PATIENT SAMPLE: The National Cancer Database (NCDB) was utilized 
      to identify adults aged 18 years or older who were diagnosed with histologically 
      confirmed SCGs between 2010 and 2019. OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcomes of interest 
      were survival outcomes at three specific time points postdiagnosis: 1, 3, and 5 
      years. These outcomes were formed by combining the "Vital Status" and "Last 
      Contact or Death (Months from Diagnosis)" variables. Model performance was 
      evaluated visually and numerically. The visual evaluation utilized receiver 
      operating characteristic (ROC) curves, precision-recall curves (PRCs), and 
      calibration curves. The numerical evaluation involved metrics such as 
      sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, area under the PRC (AUPRC), area under the 
      ROC curve (AUROC), and Brier Score. METHODS: We employed five ML 
      algorithms-TabPFN, CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Random Forest-along with the 
      Optuna library for hyperparameter optimization. The models that yielded the 
      highest AUROC values were chosen for integration into the online calculator. To 
      enhance the explicability of our models, we utilized SHapley Additive 
      exPlanations (SHAP) for assessing the relative significance of predictor 
      variables and incorporated partial dependence plots (PDPs) to delineate the 
      influence of singular variables on the predictions made by the top performing 
      models. RESULTS: For the 1-year survival analysis, 4,913 patients [5.6% with 
      1-year mortality]; for the 3-year survival analysis, 4,027 patients (11.5% with 
      3-year mortality]; and for the 5-year survival analysis, 2,854 patients (20.4% 
      with 5-year mortality) were included. The top models achieved AUROCs of 0.938 for 
      1-year mortality (TabPFN), 0.907 for 3-year mortality (LightGBM), and 0.902 for 
      5-year mortality (Random Forest). Global SHAP analyses across survival outcomes 
      at different time points identified histology, tumor grade, age, surgery, 
      radiotherapy, and tumor size as the most significant predictor variables for the 
      top-performing models. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates ML techniques can 
      develop highly accurate prognostic models for SCG patients with excellent 
      discriminatory ability. The interactive online calculator provides a tool for 
      assessment by physicians 
      (https://huggingface.co/spaces/MSHS-Neurosurgery-Research/NCDB-SCG). Local 
      interpretability informs prediction influences for a given individual. External 
      validation across diverse datasets could further substantiate potential utility 
      and generalizability. This robust, interpretable methodology aligns with the 
      goals of precision medicine, establishing a foundation for continued research 
      leveraging ML's predictive power to enhance patient counseling.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the field of computational personalized medicine, drug response 
      prediction (DRP) is a critical issue. However, existing studies often 
      characterize drugs as strings, a representation that does not align with the 
      natural description of molecules. Additionally, they ignore gene pathway-specific 
      combinatorial implication. RESULTS: In this study, we propose drug Graph and gene 
      Pathway based Drug response prediction method (GPDRP), a new multimodal deep 
      learning model for predicting drug responses based on drug molecular graphs and 
      gene pathway activity. In GPDRP, drugs are represented by molecular graphs, while 
      cell lines are described by gene pathway activity scores. The model separately 
      learns these two types of data using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) with Graph 
      Transformers and deep neural networks. Predictions are subsequently made through 
      fully connected layers. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that Graph 
      Transformer-based model delivers superior performance. We apply GPDRP on hundreds 
      of cancer cell lines' bulk RNA-sequencing data, and it outperforms some recently 
      published models. Furthermore, the generalizability and applicability of GPDRP 
      are demonstrated through its predictions on unknown drug-cell line pairs and 
      xenografts. This underscores the interpretability achieved by incorporating gene 
      pathways.

AB  - The convergence of next-generation sequencing and advanced computational methods 
      has reshaped genomic analysis by enabling unprecedented volumes of molecular data 
      to be generated and scrutinized. This chapter surveys the rapidly evolving 
      landscape of deep genomics, highlighting how breakthroughs in deep learning 
      frameworks-such as Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, 
      Transformers, and Graph Neural Networks-allow researchers to detect, 
      characterize, and interpret complex genetic alterations. We begin by illustrating 
      the progression from traditional bioinformatics to contemporary neural 
      architectures capable of identifying fine-grained molecular signals. CNNs excel 
      at discerning localized sequence motifs, RNNs capture dynamic expression patterns 
      in sequential data, Transformers unveil long-range dependencies crucial for 
      pinpointing regulatory variants, and GNNs trace systemic gene-gene and 
      protein-protein interactions, clarifying how single mutations can ripple 
      throughout biological networks.A central theme is the integration of diverse omic 
      layers-encompassing epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic profiles to offer a 
      more comprehensive perspective on genomic regulation. While this approach 
      amplifies the detection power for pathogenic variants and hidden biomarkers, it 
      also poses significant methodological hurdles related to data harmonization and 
      interpretability. Techniques such as saliency mapping, SHAP analysis, and 
      gradient-based CAM illuminate the internal logic of these deep models, 
      strengthening reliability in clinical diagnostics and fueling mechanistic 
      insights in research settings. Beyond methodological innovations, the chapter 
      underscores data privacy, systematic bias mitigation, and explainability 
      protocols as foundational elements for the safe and ethical use of deep genomics 
      tools in clinical and research environments. Regulatory compliance and 
      transparent communication of model outputs are indispensable for cultivating 
      public trust and ensuring equitable access to genomic medicine.Looking ahead, 
      emerging technologies such as secure multi-institutional data analysis protocols, 
      federated learning, and potential quantum computing applications offer promising 
      avenues for scaling analysis to ever-larger datasets without jeopardizing patient 
      privacy. As these advancements merge with more refined models, precision medicine 
      stands to benefit from unprecedented accuracy in variant interpretation, timely 
      disease diagnosis, and effective therapeutic strategies. By integrating 
      cutting-edge computational methods with robust ethical frameworks, deep genomics 
      is poised to transform our understanding of genetic variation and its 
      implications for human health.

AB  - The emergence of digital twins (DTs) in the arena of anticancer treatment echoes 
      the transformative impact of artificial intelligence in drug development. DTs 
      provide dynamic, accessible platforms that may accurately replicate patient and 
      tumor characteristics. The potential of DTs in clinical investigation is 
      particularly compelling. By comparing data from virtual trials with conventional 
      trial results, medical teams can significantly enhance the reliability of their 
      studies. Moreover, a significant breakthrough in clinical research is the ability 
      of DT to augment patient data during ongoing trials, enabling adaptive trial 
      designs and more robust statistical analyses to be performed even with limited 
      patient populations. The development of DTs faces however several technical and 
      methodological challenges. These include their tendency to produce unreliable 
      predictions, non-factual information, reasoning errors, systematic biases, and a 
      lack of interpretability. Future research in this field should focus on an 
      interdisciplinary approach that brings together experts from diverse fields, 
      including mathematicians, biologists, and physicians. This collaborative strategy 
      promises to unlock new frontiers in personalized cancer treatment and medical 
      methodologies.

TI  - Biomarker-Guided Dietary Supplementation: A Narrative Review of Precision in 
      Personalized Nutrition.
LID - 10.3390/nu16234033 [doi]
LID - 4033
AB  - Background: Dietary supplements (DS) are widely used to address nutritional 
      deficiencies and promote health, yet their indiscriminate use often leads to 
      reduced efficacy, adverse effects, and safety concerns. Biomarker-driven 
      approaches have emerged as a promising strategy to optimize DS prescriptions, 
      ensuring precision and reducing risks associated with generic recommendations. 
      Methods: This narrative review synthesizes findings from key studies on 
      biomarker-guided dietary supplementation and the integration of artificial 
      intelligence (AI) in biomarker analysis. Key biomarker categories-genomic, 
      proteomic, metabolomic, lipidomic, microbiome, and immunological-were reviewed, 
      alongside AI applications for interpreting these biomarkers and tailoring 
      supplement prescriptions. Results: Biomarkers enable the identification of 
      deficiencies, metabolic imbalances, and disease predispositions, supporting 
      targeted and safe DS use. For example, genomic markers like MTHFR polymorphisms 
      inform folate supplementation needs, while metabolomic markers such as glucose 
      and insulin levels guide interventions in metabolic disorders. AI-driven tools 
      streamline biomarker interpretation, optimize supplement selection, and enhance 
      therapeutic outcomes by accounting for complex biomarker interactions and 
      individual needs. Limitations: Despite these advancements, AI tools face 
      significant challenges, including reliance on incomplete training datasets and a 
      limited number of clinically validated algorithms. Additionally, most current 
      research focuses on clinical populations, limiting generalizability to healthier 
      populations. Long-term studies remain scarce, raising questions about the 
      sustained efficacy and safety of biomarker-guided supplementation. Regulatory 
      ambiguity further complicates the classification of supplements, especially when 
      combinations exhibit pharmaceutical-like effects. Conclusions: Biomarker-guided 
      DS prescription, augmented by AI, represents a cornerstone of personalized 
      nutrition. While offering significant potential for precision and efficacy, 
      advancing these strategies requires addressing challenges such as incomplete AI 
      data, regulatory uncertainties, and the lack of long-term studies. By overcoming 
      these obstacles, clinicians can better meet individual health needs, prevent 
      diseases, and integrate precision nutrition into routine care.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence-Guided Neuromodulation in Heart Failure with Preserved 
      and Reduced Ejection Fraction: Mechanisms, Evidence, and Future Directions.
LID - 10.3390/jcdd12080314 [doi]
LID - 314
AB  - Heart failure, a significant global health burden, is divided into heart failure 
      with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), 
      characterized by systolic dysfunction and diastolic stiffness, respectively. 
      While HFrEF benefits from pharmacological and device-based therapies, HFpEF lacks 
      effective treatments, with both conditions leading to high rehospitalization 
      rates and reduced quality of life, especially in older adults with comorbidities. 
      This review explores the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in advancing 
      autonomic neuromodulation for heart failure management. AI enhances patient 
      selection, optimizes stimulation strategies, and enables adaptive, closed-loop 
      systems. In HFrEF, vagus nerve stimulation and baroreflex activation therapy 
      improve functional status and biomarkers, while AI-driven models adjust 
      stimulation dynamically based on physiological feedback. In HFpEF, AI aids in 
      deep phenotyping to identify responsive subgroups for neuromodulatory 
      interventions. Clinical tools support remote monitoring, risk assessment, and 
      symptom detection. However, challenges like data integration, ethical oversight, 
      and clinical adoption limit real-world application. Algorithm transparency, bias 
      minimization, and equitable access are critical for success. Interdisciplinary 
      collaboration and ethical innovation are essential to develop personalized, 
      data-driven, patient-centered heart failure treatment strategies through 
      AI-guided neuromodulation.

TI  - APNet, an explainable sparse deep learning model to discover differentially 
      active drivers of severe COVID-19.
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btaf063 [doi]
LID - btaf063
AB  - MOTIVATION: Computational analyses of bulk and single-cell omics provide 
      translational insights into complex diseases, such as COVID-19, by revealing 
      molecules, cellular phenotypes, and signalling patterns that contribute to 
      unfavourable clinical outcomes. Current in silico approaches dovetail 
      differential abundance, biostatistics, and machine learning, but often overlook 
      nonlinear proteomic dynamics, like post-translational modifications, and provide 
      limited biological interpretability beyond feature ranking. RESULTS: We introduce 
      APNet, a novel computational pipeline that combines differential activity 
      analysis based on SJARACNe co-expression networks with PASNet, a biologically 
      informed sparse deep learning model, to perform explainable predictions for 
      COVID-19 severity. The APNet driver-pathway network ingests SJARACNe 
      co-regulation and classification weights to aid result interpretation and 
      hypothesis generation. APNet outperforms alternative models in patient 
      classification across three COVID-19 proteomic datasets, identifying predictive 
      drivers and pathways, including some confirmed in single-cell omics and 
      highlighting under-explored biomarker circuitries in COVID-19. AVAILABILITY AND 
      IMPLEMENTATION: APNet's R, Python scripts, and Cytoscape methodologies are 
      available at https://github.com/BiodataAnalysisGroup/APNet.

TI  - Predicting Anticancer Drug Response With Deep Learning Constrained by Signaling

AB  - Thanks to the availability of multiomics data of individual cancer patients, 
      precision medicine or personalized medicine is becoming a promising treatment for 
      individual cancer patients. However, the association patterns, that is, the 
      mechanism of response (MoR) between large-scale multiomics features and drug 
      response are complex and heterogeneous and remain unclear. Although there are 
      existing computational models for predicting drug response using the 
      high-dimensional multiomics features, it remains challenging to uncover the 
      complex molecular mechanism of drug responses. To reduce the number of 
      predictors/features and make the model more interpretable, in this study, 46 
      signaling pathways were used to build a deep learning model constrained by 
      signaling pathways, consDeepSignaling, for anti-drug response prediction. 
      Multiomics data, like gene expression and copy number variation, of individual 
      genes can be integrated naturally in this model. The signaling 
      pathway-constrained deep learning model was evaluated using the multiomics data 
      of ∼1000 cancer cell lines in the Broad Institute Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia 
      (CCLE) database and the corresponding drug-cancer cell line response data set in 
      the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database. The evaluation 
      results showed that the proposed model outperformed the existing deep neural 
      network models. Also, the model interpretation analysis indicated the distinctive 
      patterns of importance of signaling pathways in anticancer drug response 
      prediction.

TI  - In Silico Research Is Rewriting the Rules of Drug Development: Is It the End of 
      Human Trials?

AB  - Recent advances in computational biology, artificial intelligence (AI), and 
      regulatory science are rapidly displacing the traditional reliance on animal and 
      early-phase human trials in drug development. In April 2025, the U.S. Food and 
      Drug Administration announced a landmark decision to phase out mandatory animal 
      testing for many drug types, signaling a paradigm shift toward in silico 
      methodologies. This editorial explores how computer-based models, especially 
      digital twins, are emerging as the fourth pillar of biomedical science, capable 
      of simulating complex human systems with remarkable accuracy. Drawing on 
      real-world examples from oncology, neurology, and regulatory submissions, the 
      editorial argues that in silico tools are no longer ancillary but central to 
      modern research. These technologies enable rapid, ethical, and cost-effective 
      drug discovery while offering personalized therapeutic insights. As machine 
      learning, multi-omics integration, and predictive simulations mature, their 
      regulatory credibility grows, particularly in initiatives such as model-informed 
      drug development and digital therapeutics. The editorial concludes by urging the 
      adoption of standardized frameworks, explainable AI, and infrastructure 
      investment to ensure in silico research fulfills its transformative potential. 
      Within a decade, failure to employ these methods may no longer be merely 
      outdated, it may be indefensible.

AB  - The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into laboratory medicine, is 
      revolutionizing diagnostic accuracy, operational efficiency, and personalized 
      patient care. AI technologies(machine learning, natural language processing and 
      computer vision) advance evidence-based laboratory medicine (EBLM) by automating 
      and optimizing critical processes(formulating clinical questions, conducting 
      literature searches, appraising evidence, and developing clinical guidelines). 
      These reduce the time for systematic reviews, ensuring consistency in appraisal, 
      and enabling real-time updates to guidelines. AI supports personalized medicine 
      by analyzing large datasets, genetic information and electronic health records 
      (EHRs), to tailor diagnostic and treatment plans to patient profiles. Predictive 
      analytics enhance outcomes by leveraging historical data and ongoing monitoring 
      to predict responses and optimize care pathways. Despite the transformative 
      potential, there are challenges. The accuracy, transparency, and explainability 
      of AI algorithms is critical for gaining trust and ensuring ethical deployment. 
      Integration into existing clinical workflows requires collaboration between AI 
      developers and users to ensure seamless user-friendly adoption. Ethical 
      considerations, such as privacy,data security, and algorithmic bias, must also be 
      addressed to mitigate risks and ensure equitable healthcare delivery. Regulatory 
      frameworks, eg. The EU AI Regulation, emphasize transparency, data governance, 
      and human oversight, particularly for high-risk AI systems. The economic and 
      operational benefits are cost savings, improved diagnostic precision, and 
      enhanced patient outcomes. Future trends (federated learning and self-supervised 
      learning), will enhance the scalability and applicability of AI in EBLM, paving 
      the way for a new era of precision medicine. AI in EBLM has the potential to 
      transform healthcare delivery, improve patient outcomes, and advance 
      personalized/precision medicine.

AB  - The analytes qualified as biomarkers are potent tools to diagnose various 
      diseases, monitor therapy responses, and design therapeutic interventions. The 
      early assessment of the diverseness of human disease is essential for the speedy 
      and cost-efficient implementation of personalized medicine. We developed 
      g3mclass, the Gaussian mixture modeling software for molecular assay data 
      classification. This software automates the validated multiclass classifier 
      applicable to single analyte tests and multiplexing assays. The g3mclass achieves 
      automation using the original semi-constrained expectation-maximization (EM) 
      algorithm that allows inference from the test, control, and query data that human 
      experts cannot interpret. In this study, we used real-world clinical data and 
      gene expression datasets (ERBB2, ESR1, PGR) to provide examples of how g3mclass 
      may help overcome the problems of over-/underdiagnosis and equivocal results in 
      diagnostic tests for breast cancer. We showed the g3mclass output's accuracy, 
      robustness, scalability, and interpretability. The user-friendly interface and 
      free dissemination of this multi-platform software aim to ease its use by 
      research laboratories, biomedical pharma, companion diagnostic developers, and 
      healthcare regulators. Furthermore, the g3mclass automatic extracting information 
      through probabilistic modeling is adaptable for blending with machine learning 
      and artificial intelligence.

AB  - Omics data generated from high-throughput technologies and clinical features 
      jointly impact many complex human diseases. Identifying key biomarkers and 
      clinical risk factors is essential for understanding disease mechanisms and 
      advancing early disease diagnosis and precision medicine. However, the 
      high-dimensionality and intricate associations between disease outcomes and omics 
      profiles present significant analytical challenges. To address these, we propose 
      an ensemble data-driven biomarker identification tool, Hybrid Feature Screening 
      (HFS), to construct a candidate feature set for downstream advanced machine 
      learning models. The pre-screened candidate features from HFS are further refined 
      using a computationally efficient permutation-based feature importance test, 
      forming the comprehensive High-dimensional Feature Importance Test (HiFIT) 
      framework. Through extensive numerical simulations and real-world applications, 
      we demonstrate HiFIT's superior performance in both outcome prediction and 
      feature importance identification. An R package implementing HiFIT is available 
      on GitHub (https://github.com/BZou-lab/HiFIT).

      valued at 9.01 billion USD, it is a rapidly growing market, projected to increase 
      by 40% per annum. There has been great interest in how AI could transform the 
      practice of medicine, with the potential to improve all healthcare spheres from 
      workflow management, accessibility, and cost efficiency to enhanced diagnostics 
      with improved prognostic accuracy, allowing the practice of precision medicine. 
      The applicability of AI is particularly promising for transplant medicine, in 
      which it can help navigate the complex interplay of a myriad of variables and 
      improve patient care. However, caution must be exercised when developing DL 
      models, ensuring they are trained with large, reliable, and diverse datasets to 
      minimize bias and increase generalizability. There must be transparency in the 
      methodology and extensive validation of the model, including randomized 
      controlled trials to demonstrate performance and cultivate trust among physicians 
      and patients. Furthermore, there is a need to regulate this rapidly evolving 
      field, with updated policies for the governance of AI-based technologies. Taking 
      this in consideration, we summarize the latest transplant AI developments from 
      the Ajmera Transplant Center's inaugural symposium.

AB  - Deep learning approaches for clinical predictions based on magnetic resonance 
      imaging data have shown great promise as a translational technology for diagnosis 
      and prognosis in neurological disorders, but its clinical impact has been 
      limited. This is partially attributed to the opaqueness of deep learning models, 
      causing insufficient understanding of what underlies their decisions. To overcome 
      this, we trained convolutional neural networks on structural brain scans to 
      differentiate dementia patients from healthy controls, and applied layerwise 
      relevance propagation to procure individual-level explanations of the model 
      predictions. Through extensive validations we demonstrate that deviations 
      recognized by the model corroborate existing knowledge of structural brain 
      aberrations in dementia. By employing the explainable dementia classifier in a 
      longitudinal dataset of patients with mild cognitive impairment, we show that the 
      spatially rich explanations complement the model prediction when forecasting 
      transition to dementia and help characterize the biological manifestation of 
      disease in the individual brain. Overall, our work exemplifies the clinical 
      potential of explainable artificial intelligence in precision medicine.

TI  - Drug repurposing: Clinical practices and regulatory pathways.
PG  - 61-68
LID - 10.4103/picr.picr_70_24 [doi]
AB  - Drug repurposing, also known as drug repositioning or reprofiling, involves 
      identifying new therapeutic uses for existing drugs beyond their original 
      indications. Historical examples include sildenafil citrate transitioning to an 
      erectile dysfunction treatment and thalidomide shifting from a sedative to an 
      immunomodulatory agent. Advocates tout its potential to address unmet medical 
      needs by expediting development, reducing costs, and using drugs with established 
      safety profiles. However, concerns exist regarding specificity for new 
      indications, safety, and regulatory exploitation. Ethical considerations include 
      equitable access, informed consent when using drugs off-label, and transparency. 
      Recent advancements include artificial intelligence (AI) applications, network 
      pharmacology, and omics technologies. Clinical trials explore repurposed drugs' 
      efficacy, with regulatory agencies facilitating approval. Challenges include 
      intellectual property protection, drug target specificity, trial design 
      complexities, and funding limitations. Ethical challenges encompass patient 
      autonomy, potential conflicts of interest due to financial incentives for 
      industries, and resource allocation. Future directions involve precision 
      medicine, AI, and global collaboration. In conclusion, drug repurposing offers a 
      promising pathway for therapeutic innovation but requires careful consideration 
      of its complexities and ethical implications to maximize benefits and minimize 
      risks.

AB  - In clinical optical molecular imaging, the need for real-time high frame rates 
      and low excitation doses to ensure patient safety inherently increases 
      susceptibility to detection noise. Faced with the challenge of image degradation 
      caused by severe noise, image denoising is essential for mitigating the trade-off 
      between acquisition cost and image quality. However, prevailing deep learning 
      methods exhibit uncontrollable and suboptimal performance with limited 
      interpretability, primarily due to neglecting underlying physical model and 
      frequency information. In this work, we introduce an end-to-end model-driven Deep 
      Equilibrium Unfolding Mamba (DEQ-UMamba) that integrates proximal gradient 
      descent technique and learnt spatial-frequency characteristics to decouple 
      complex noise structures into statistical distributions, enabling effective noise 
      estimation and suppression in fluorescent images. Moreover, to address the 
      computational limitations of unfolding networks, DEQ-UMamba trains an implicit 
      mapping by directly differentiating the equilibrium point of the convergent 
      solution, thereby ensuring stability and avoiding non-convergent behavior. With 
      each network module aligned to a corresponding operation in the iterative 
      optimization process, the proposed method achieves clear structural 
      interpretability and strong performance. Comprehensive experiments conducted on 
      both clinical and in vivo datasets demonstrate that DEQ-UMamba outperforms 
      current state-of-the-art alternatives while utilizing fewer parameters, 
      facilitating the advancement of cost-effective and high-quality clinical 
      molecular imaging.

LID - 10.2147/PGPM.S396971 [doi]
AB  - Natural language processing (NLP), a technology that translates human language 
      into machine-readable data, is revolutionizing numerous sectors, including cancer 
      care. This review outlines the evolution of NLP and its potential for crafting 
      personalized treatment pathways for cancer patients. Leveraging NLP's ability to 
      transform unstructured medical data into structured learnable formats, 
      researchers can tap into the potential of big data for clinical and research 
      applications. Significant advancements in NLP have spurred interest in developing 
      tools that automate information extraction from clinical text, potentially 
      transforming medical research and clinical practices in radiation oncology. 
      Applications discussed include symptom and toxicity monitoring, identification of 
      social determinants of health, improving patient-physician communication, patient 
      education, and predictive modeling. However, several challenges impede the full 
      realization of NLP's benefits, such as privacy and security concerns, biases in 
      NLP models, and the interpretability and generalizability of these models. 
      Overcoming these challenges necessitates a collaborative effort between computer 
      scientists and the radiation oncology community. This paper serves as a 
      comprehensive guide to understanding the intricacies of NLP algorithms, their 
      performance assessment, past research contributions, and the future of NLP in 
      radiation oncology research and clinics.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ageing is a multifactorial process closely associated with increased 
      risk of chronic diseases. While epigenetic clocks have advanced ageing research, 
      most rely on isolated CpG sites, limiting biological interpretability. We 
      developed PathwayAge, a biologically informed model that captures coordinated 
      methylation changes at the pathway level, providing interpretable insights into 
      ageing biology and disease mechanisms. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional 
      study using genome-wide DNA methylation data from 10,615 individuals across 19 
      cohorts and 3413 Han Chinese participants, along with transcriptomic data from 
      3384 samples. A two-stage machine learning model aggregated CpG sites into GO or 
      KEGG pathway-level features to predict chronological age. Model accuracy was 
      assessed using mean absolute error (MAE) and Pearson correlation (Rho). Age 
      acceleration residuals (AgeAcc) were computed and tested for associations with 
      nine diseases using non-parametric statistics. FINDINGS: PathwayAge achieved high 
      predictive accuracy (Rho = 0.977, MAE = 2.350) in cross-validation and across 15 
      independent blood-based validation cohorts (Rho = 0.677-0.979, MAE = 
      2.113-6.837), including a Chinese population (Rho = 0.972, MAE = 2.302). Compared 
      to established clocks, PathwayAge showed improved performance in both age 
      estimation and disease association analyses. Significant AgeAcc differences were 
      observed across nine diseases, with disease-specific pathways confirmed by 
      permutation tests (P < 0.02). Top pathways implicated in ageing included 
      autophagy, cell adhesion, synaptic signalling, and metabolic regulation. GO-based 
      clustering revealed consistent ageing signatures across disease categories, 
      including neuropsychiatric, immune, metabolic, and cancer-related conditions. 
      Cross-omics validation using transcriptomic data further supported the model's 
      biological relevance (Rho = 0.70, MAE = 7.21). INTERPRETATION: PathwayAge 
      represents an interpretable, biologically grounded framework for estimating 
      epigenetic age. By integrating pathway-level methylation signals, it uncovers 
      mechanistic links between ageing and disease, with potential applications in 
      biomarker development and precision ageing medicine. FUNDING: This research was 
      supported by the Greater Bay Area Institute of Precision Medicine (Grant No. 
      I0007), the National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 32370639), and

LID - 2154
AB  - Background: Theintegration of artificial intelligence (AI) into clinical decision 
      support systems (CDSSs) has significantly enhanced diagnostic precision, risk 
      stratification, and treatment planning. AI models remain a barrier to clinical 
      adoption, emphasizing the critical role of explainable AI (XAI). Methods: This 
      systematic meta-analysis synthesizes findings from 62 peer-reviewed studies 
      published between 2018 and 2025, examining the use of XAI methods within CDSSs 
      across various clinical domains, including radiology, oncology, neurology, and 
      critical care. Model-agnostic techniques such as visualization models like 
      Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and attention mechanisms 
      dominated in imaging and sequential data tasks. Results: However, there are still 
      gaps in user-friendly evaluation, methodological transparency, and ethical 
      issues, as seen by the absence of research that evaluated explanation fidelity, 
      clinician trust, or usability in real-world settings. In order to enable 
      responsible AI implementation in healthcare, our analysis emphasizes the 
      necessity of longitudinal clinical validation, participatory system design, and 
      uniform interpretability measures. Conclusions: This review offers a thorough 
      analysis of the state of XAI practices in CDSSs today, identifies methodological 
      and practical issues, and suggests a path forward for AI solutions that are open, 
      moral, and clinically relevant.

TI  - Postprandial glucose-management strategies in type 1 diabetes: Current approaches 
      and prospects with precision medicine and artificial intelligence.
PG  - 1555-1566
LID - 10.1111/dom.15463 [doi]
AB  - Postprandial glucose control can be challenging for individuals with type 1 
      diabetes, and this can be attributed to many factors, including suboptimal 
      therapy parameters (carbohydrate ratios, correction factors, basal doses) because 
      of physiological changes, meal macronutrients and engagement in postprandial 
      physical activity. This narrative review aims to examine the current postprandial 
      glucose-management strategies tested in clinical trials, including adjusting 
      therapy settings, bolusing for meal macronutrients, adjusting pre-exercise and 
      postexercise meal boluses for postprandial physical activity, and other 
      therapeutic options, for individuals on open-loop and closed-loop therapies. Then 
      we discuss their challenges and future avenues. Despite advancements in insulin 
      delivery devices such as closed-loop systems and decision-support systems, many 
      individuals with type 1 diabetes still struggle to manage their glucose levels. 
      The main challenge is the lack of personalized recommendations, causing 
      suboptimal postprandial glucose control. We suggest that postprandial glucose 
      control can be improved by (i) providing personalized recommendations for meal 
      macronutrients and postprandial activity; (ii) including behavioural 
      recommendations; (iii) using other personalized therapeutic approaches (e.g. 
      glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, sodium-glucose co-transporter 
      inhibitors, amylin analogues, inhaled insulin) in addition to insulin therapy; 
      and (iv) integrating an interpretability report to explain to individuals about 
      changes in treatment therapy and behavioural recommendations. In addition, we 
      suggest a future avenue to implement precision recommendations for individuals 
      with type 1 diabetes utilizing the potential of deep reinforcement learning and 
      foundation models (such as GPT and BERT), employing different modalities of data 
      including diabetes-related and external background factors (i.e. behavioural, 
      environmental, biological and abnormal events).

AB  - Genome editing has revolutionized modern biotechnology, enabling precise 
      modifications to DNA sequences with far-reaching applications in medicine, 
      agriculture, and synthetic biology. Recent advancements in artificial 
      intelligence (AI) have significantly enhanced genome editing by improving target 
      selection, minimizing off-target effects, and optimizing CRISPR-associated 
      systems. AI-driven models, such as deep learning-based predictors and protein 
      language models, enable more accurate sgRNA design, novel Cas protein discovery, 
      and enhanced gene regulatory network analysis. Additionally, AI-powered tools 
      facilitate large-scale data integration, accelerating functional genomics and 
      therapeutic genome editing. This review explores the intersection of AI and 
      genome editing, highlighting key innovations, challenges, and future prospects. 
      Despite its transformative potential, AI-driven genome editing raises ethical 
      concerns regarding data bias, algorithmic transparency, and unintended genetic 
      modifications. Addressing these challenges requires interdisciplinary 
      collaboration between AI researchers, molecular biologists, and policymakers. As 
      AI continues to evolve, its integration with genome editing will pave the way for 
      groundbreaking advancements in precision medicine, genetic disease treatment, and 
      sustainable agriculture.

TI  - Deep centroid: a general deep cascade classifier for biomedical omics data 
      classification.
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btae039 [doi]
LID - btae039
AB  - MOTIVATION: Classification of samples using biomedical omics data is a widely 
      used method in biomedical research. However, these datasets often possess 
      challenging characteristics, including high dimensionality, limited sample sizes, 
      and inherent biases across diverse sources. These factors limit the performance 
      of traditional machine learning models, particularly when applied to independent 
      datasets. RESULTS: To address these challenges, we propose a novel classifier, 
      Deep Centroid, which combines the stability of the nearest centroid classifier 
      and the strong fitting ability of the deep cascade strategy. Deep Centroid is an 
      ensemble learning method with a multi-layer cascade structure, consisting of 
      feature scanning and cascade learning stages that can dynamically adjust the 
      training scale. We apply Deep Centroid to three precision medicine 
      applications-cancer early diagnosis, cancer prognosis, and drug sensitivity 
      prediction-using cell-free DNA fragmentations, gene expression profiles, and DNA 
      methylation data. Experimental results demonstrate that Deep Centroid outperforms 
      six traditional machine learning models in all three applications, showcasing its 
      potential in biological omics data classification. Furthermore, functional 
      annotations reveal that the features scanned by the model exhibit biological 
      significance, indicating its interpretability from a biological perspective. Our 
      findings underscore the promising application of Deep Centroid in the 
      classification of biomedical omics data, particularly in the field of precision 
      medicine. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Deep Centroid is available at both 
      github (github.com/xiexiexiekuan/DeepCentroid) and Figshare 
      (https://figshare.com/articles/software/Deep_Centroid_A_General_Deep_Cascade_Classifier_for_Biomedical_Omics_Data_Classification/24993516).

TI  - Interpretable Machine Learning for Proteomics-Based Subtyping and Tumor 
      Mutational Burden Prediction in Endometrial Cancer.
PG  - e70024
LID - 10.1002/prca.70024 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Endometrial carcinoma (EC) represents a significant clinical 
      challenge due to its pronounced molecular heterogeneity, directly influencing 
      prognosis and therapeutic responses. Accurate classification of molecular 
      subtypes (CNV-high, CNV-low, MSI-H, POLE) and precise tumor mutational burden 
      (TMB) assessment is crucial for guiding personalized therapeutic interventions. 
      Integrating proteomics data with advanced machine learning (ML) techniques offers 
      a promising strategy for achieving precise, clinically actionable classification 
      and biomarker discovery in EC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using proteomic data from 
      95 EC patients (83 endometrioid, 12 serous), sourced from the Clinical Proteomic 
      Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), we developed an ML pipeline integrating 
      proteomic feature selection (Lasso-penalized logistic regression), classification 
      modeling, and interpretability analysis. The dataset was divided into training 
      (70%) and test (30%) sets, with synthetic minority oversampling (SMOTE) applied 
      to address the class imbalance. Logistic regression models were trained for 
      molecular subtypes classification, and the TMB prediction model performance was 
      evaluated using accuracy, AUC, precision, recall, and F1-score. Model 
      interpretability was enhanced using explainable AI (XAI) techniques: SHapley 
      Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations 
      (LIME). RESULTS: Feature selection reduced the proteomic dataset from 11,000 to 
      eight key proteins. The proteomics-based ML model demonstrated robust predictive 
      performance, accurately classifying EC molecular subtypes (accuracy: 82.8%; AUC: 
      0.990) and distinguishing high (≥10 mutations/Mb) versus low TMB (<10 
      mutations/Mb) cases (accuracy: 89.7%; AUC: 0.984). SHAP analysis highlighted 
      clinically recognized biomarkers (MLH1, PMS2, STAT1) and identified novel protein 
      candidates (MTHFD2, MAST4, RPL22L1, MX2, SEC16A). LIME analysis provided 
      individualized prediction interpretations, clarifying each protein biomarker's 
      influence on model decisions. CONCLUSION: Our proteomics-driven ML approach 
      demonstrates high accuracy and interpretability in EC subtype classification and 
      TMB prediction. By identifying validated and novel biomarkers, this strategy 
      provides essential biological insights and a strong foundation for the future 
      development of non-invasive diagnostics, personalized treatments, and precision 
      medicine in EC.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence in Primary Malignant Bone Tumor Imaging: A Narrative 
      Review.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics15131714 [doi]
LID - 1714
AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force in orthopedic 
      oncology, offering significant advances in the diagnosis, classification, and 
      prediction of treatment response for primary malignant bone tumors (PBT). Through 
      machine learning and deep learning techniques, AI leverages computational 
      algorithms and large datasets to enhance medical imaging interpretation and 
      support clinical decision-making. The integration of radiomics with AI enables 
      the extraction of quantitative features from medical images, allowing for precise 
      tumor characterization and the development of personalized therapeutic 
      strategies. Notably, convolutional neural networks have demonstrated exceptional 
      capabilities in pattern recognition, significantly improving tumor detection, 
      segmentation, and differentiation. This narrative review synthesizes the evolving 
      applications of AI in PBTs, focusing on early tumor detection, imaging analysis, 
      therapy response prediction, and histological classification. AI-driven radiomics 
      and predictive models have yielded promising results in assessing chemotherapy 
      efficacy, optimizing preoperative imaging, and predicting treatment outcomes, 
      thereby advancing the field of precision medicine. Innovative segmentation 
      techniques and multimodal imaging models have further enhanced healthcare 
      efficiency by reducing physician workload and improving diagnostic accuracy. 
      Despite these advancements, challenges remain. The rarity of PBTs limits the 
      availability of robust, high-quality datasets for model development and 
      validation, while the lack of standardized imaging protocols complicates 
      reproducibility. Ethical considerations, including data privacy and the 
      interpretability of complex AI algorithms, also warrant careful attention. Future 
      research should prioritize multicenter collaborations, external validation of AI 
      models, and the integration of explainable AI systems into clinical practice. 
      Addressing these challenges will unlock AI's full potential to revolutionize PBT 
      management, ultimately improving patient outcomes and advancing personalized 
      care.

      unpredictable in vivo behavior, and inefficient trial-and-error approaches. AREAS 
      COVERED: This review covers the application of AI and Machine Learning (ML) 
      across the nanomedicine development pipeline, starting from drug and target 
      identification to nanoparticle design, toxicity prediction, and personalized 
      dosing. Different AI/ML models like QSAR, MTK-QSBER, and Alchemite, along with 
      data sources and high-throughput screening methods, have been explored. 
      Real-world applications are critically discussed, including AI-assisted drug 
      repurposing, controlled-release formulations, and cancer-specific delivery 
      systems. EXPERT OPINION: AI has emerged as an essential component in designing 
      next-generation nanomedicine. Efficiently handling multidimensional datasets, 
      optimizing formulations, and personalizing treatment regimens, it has sped up the 
      innovation process. However, challenges like data heterogeneity, model 
      transparency, and regulatory gaps remain. Addressing these hurdles through 
      interdisciplinary efforts and emerging innovations like explainable AI and 
      federated learning will pave the way for the clinical translation of AI-driven 
      nanomedicine.

AB  - The 3D organization of the genome plays a critical role in regulating gene 
      expression, maintaining cellular identity, and mediating responses to 
      environmental cues. Advances in super-resolution microscopy and genomic 
      technologies have enabled unprecedented insights into chromatin architecture at 
      nanoscale resolution. However, the complexity and volume of data generated by 
      these techniques necessitate innovative computational strategies for effective 
      analysis and interpretation. In this review, we explore the transformative role 
      of deep learning in the analysis of 3D genome organization, highlighting how deep 
      learning models are being leveraged to enhance image reconstruction, 
      segmentation, and dynamic tracking in chromatin research. We provide an overview 
      of deep learning-enhanced methodologies that significantly improve spatial and 
      temporal resolution of images, with a special focus on single-molecule 
      localization microscopy. Furthermore, we discuss deep learning's contribution to 
      segmentation accuracy, and its application in single-particle tracking for 
      dissecting chromatin dynamics at the single-cell level. These advances are 
      complemented by frameworks that enable multimodal integration and 
      interpretability, pushing the boundaries of chromatin biology into clinical 
      diagnostics and personalized medicine. Finally, we discuss emerging clinical 
      applications where deep learning models, based on chromatin imaging, aid in 
      disease stratification, drug response prediction, and early cancer detection. We 
      also address the challenges of data sparsity, model interpretability and propose 
      future directions to decode genome function with higher precision and impact.

TI  - TMODINET: A trustworthy multi-omics dynamic learning integration network for 
      cancer diagnostic.

AB  - Multiple types of omics data contain a wealth of biomedical information which 
      reflect different aspects of clinical samples. Multi-omics integrated analysis is 
      more likely to lead to more accurate clinical decisions. Existing cancer 
      diagnostic methods based on multi-omics data integration mainly focus on the 
      classification accuracy of the model, while neglecting the interpretability of 
      the internal mechanism and the reliability of the results, which are crucial in 
      specific domains such as precision medicine and the life sciences. To overcome 
      this limitation, we propose a trustworthy multi-omics dynamic learning framework 
      (TMODINET) for cancer diagnostic. The framework employs multi-omics adaptive 
      dynamic learning to process each sample to provide patient-centered personality 
      diagnosis by using self-attentional learning of features and modalities. To 
      characterize the correlation between samples well, we introduce a graph dynamic 
      learning method which can adaptively adjust the graph structure according to the 
      specific classification results for specific graph convolutional networks (GCN) 
      learning. Moreover, we utilize an uncertainty mechanism by employing Dirichlet 
      distribution and Dempster-Shafer theory to obtain uncertainty and integrate 
      multi-omics data at the decision level, ensuring trustworthy for cancer 
      diagnosis. Extensive experiments on four real-world multimodal medical datasets 
      are conducted. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, the superior performance and 
      trustworthiness of our proposed algorithm are clearly validated. Our model has 
      great potential for clinical diagnosis.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Respiratory diseases like pneumonia, asthma, and COPD are major 
      global health concerns, significantly impacting morbidity and mortality rates 
      worldwide. AREAS COVERED: A selective search on PubMed, Google Scholar, and 
      ScienceDirect (up to 2024) focused on AI in diagnosing and treating respiratory 
      conditions like asthma, pneumonia, and COPD. Studies were chosen for their 
      relevance to prediction models, AI-driven diagnostics, and personalized 
      treatments. This narrative review highlights technological advancements, clinical 
      applications, and challenges in integrating AI into standard practice, with 
      emphasis on predictive tools, deep learning for imaging, and patient outcomes. 
      EXPERT OPINION: Despite these advancements, significant challenges remain in 
      fully integrating AI into pulmonary health care. The need for large, diverse 
      datasets to train AI models is critical, and concerns around data privacy, 
      algorithmic transparency, and potential biases must be carefully managed. 
      Regulatory frameworks also need to evolve to address the unique challenges posed 
      by AI in health care. However, with continued research and collaboration between 
      technology developers, clinicians, and policymakers, AI has the potential to 
      revolutionize pulmonary health care, ultimately leading to more effective, 
      efficient, and personalized care for patients.

AB  - PURPOSE: Accurate preoperative grading of gliomas is critical for therapeutic 
      planning and prognostic evaluation. We developed a noninvasive machine learning 
      model leveraging whole-brain resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging 
      (rs-fMRI) biomarkers to discriminate high-grade (HGGs) and low-grade gliomas 
      (LGGs) in the frontal lobe. METHODS: This retrospective study included 138 
      patients (78 LGGs, 60 HGGs) with left frontal gliomas. A total of 7134 features 
      were extracted from the mean amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (mALFF), mean 
      fractional ALFF, mean percentage amplitude of fluctuation (mPerAF), mean regional 
      homogeneity (mReHo) maps and resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) matrix. 
      Twelve predictive features were selected through Mann-Whitney U test, correlation 
      analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method. The patients 
      were stratified and randomized into the training and testing datasets with a 7:3 
      ratio. The logical regression, random forest, support vector machine (SVM) and 
      adaptive boosting algorithms were used to establish models. The model performance 
      was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 
      accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. RESULTS: The selected 12 features 
      included 7 RSFC features, 4 mPerAF features, and 1 mReHo feature. Based on these 
      features, the model was established using the SVM had an optimal performance. The 
      accuracy in the training and testing datasets was 0.957 and 0.727, respectively. 
      The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves was 0.972 and 0.799, 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our whole-brain rs-fMRI radiomics approach provides an 
      objective tool for preoperative glioma stratification. The biological 
      interpretability of selected features reflects distinct neuroplasticity patterns 
      between LGGs and HGGs, advancing understanding of glioma-network interactions.

AB  - Radiogenomics uses machine-learning (ML) to directly connect the morphologic and 
      physiological appearance of tumors on clinical imaging with underlying genomic 
      features. Despite extensive growth in the area of radiogenomics across many 
      cancers, and its potential role in advancing clinical decision making, no 
      published studies have directly addressed uncertainty in these model predictions. 
      We developed a radiogenomics ML model to quantify uncertainty using transductive 
      Gaussian Processes (GP) and a unique dataset of 95 image-localized biopsies with 
      spatially matched MRI from 25 untreated Glioblastoma (GBM) patients. The model 
      generated predictions for regional EGFR amplification status (a common and 
      important target in GBM) to resolve the intratumoral genetic heterogeneity across 
      each individual tumor-a key factor for future personalized therapeutic paradigms. 
      The model used probability distributions for each sample prediction to quantify 
      uncertainty, and used transductive learning to reduce the overall uncertainty. We 
      compared predictive accuracy and uncertainty of the transductive learning GP 
      model against a standard GP model using leave-one-patient-out cross validation. 
      Additionally, we used a separate dataset containing 24 image-localized biopsies 
      from 7 high-grade glioma patients to validate the model. Predictive uncertainty 
      informed the likelihood of achieving an accurate sample prediction. When 
      stratifying predictions based on uncertainty, we observed substantially higher 
      performance in the group cohort (75% accuracy, n = 95) and amongst sample 
      predictions with the lowest uncertainty (83% accuracy, n = 72) compared to 
      predictions with higher uncertainty (48% accuracy, n = 23), due largely to data 
      interpolation (rather than extrapolation). On the separate validation set, our 
      model achieved 78% accuracy amongst the sample predictions with lowest 
      uncertainty. We present a novel approach to quantify radiogenomics uncertainty to 
      enhance model performance and clinical interpretability. This should help 
      integrate more reliable radiogenomics models for improved medical 
      decision-making.

TI  - Application of Machine Learning to Improve Appropriateness of Treatment in an 
      Orthopaedic Setting of Personalized Medicine.
LID - 10.3390/jpm12101706 [doi]
LID - 1706
AB  - The rise of personalized medicine and its remarkable advancements have revealed 
      new requirements for the availability of appropriate medical decision-making 
      models. Computer science is an area that plays an essential role in the field of 
      personalized medicine, where one of the goals is to provide algorithms and tools 
      to extrapolate knowledge and improve the decision-support process. The minimum 
      clinically important difference (MCID) is the smallest change in PROM scores that 
      patients perceive as meaningful. Treatment that does not achieve the minimum 
      level of improvement is considered inappropriate as well as a potential waste of 
      resources. Using the MCID threshold to identify patients who fail to achieve the 
      minimum change in PROM that results in a meaningful outcome may aid in 
      pre-surgical shared decision-making. The decision tree algorithm is a method for 
      extracting valuable information and providing further meaningful information to 
      the domain expert that supports the decision-making. In the present study, 
      different tools based on machine learning were developed. On the one hand, we 
      compared three XGBoost models to predict the non-achievement of the MCID at six 
      months post-operation in the SF-12 physical score. The prediction score threshold 
      was set to 0.75 to provide three decision-making areas on the basis of the high 
      confidence (HC) intervals; the minority class was re-balanced by weighting the 
      positive class to penalize the loss function (XGBoost cost-sensitive), 
      oversampling the minority class (XGBoost with SMOTE), and re-sampling the 
      negative class (XGBoost with undersampling). On the other hand, we modeled the 
      data through a decision tree (assessment tree), based on different complexity 
      levels, to identify the hidden pattern and to provide a new way to understand 
      possible relationships between the gathered features and the several outcomes. 
      The results showed that all the proposed models were effective as binary 
      classifiers, as they showed moderate predictive performance both regarding the 
      minority or positive class (i.e., our targeted patients, those who will not 
      benefit from surgery) and the negative class. The decision tree visualization can 
      be exploited during the patient assessment status to better understand if those 
      patients will benefit or not from the medical intervention. Both of these tools 
      can come in handy for increasing knowledge about the patient's psychophysical 
      state and for creating an increasingly specialized assessment of the individual 
      patient.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence-Assisted Clinical Decision-Making: A Perspective on 
      Advancing Personalized Precision Medicine for Elderly Diabetes Patients.
PG  - 4643-4651
LID - 10.2147/JMDH.S529190 [doi]
AB  - The global aging population is expanding at an unprecedented rate and is 
      projected to reach 2 billion by 2050, presenting significant medical challenges, 
      particularly multimorbidity and heterogeneous responses to treatment. Using 
      diabetes as an illustrative case, this study explores the transformative 
      potential of artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted clinical decision-making to 
      advance personalized precision medicine for older adults. Through systematic 
      analysis of current healthcare practices and emerging AI technologies, we 
      examined the integration of machine learning algorithms, natural language 
      processing, and intelligent monitoring systems into diabetes care for elderly 
      populations. Based on current evidence showing up to 25% reduction in 
      hospitalization rates and 30% increase in treatment adherence, we argue that AI 
      integration represents a transformative approach to improving clinical outcomes 
      in elderly diabetes care. We contend that AI-driven clinical decision support 
      systems (CDSS) offer superior performance in risk prediction and treatment 
      optimization, with studies demonstrating diagnostic accuracy rates of up to 
      93.07%, supporting our argument for their widespread implementation. Furthermore, 
      AI-enhanced monitoring systems improved medication adherence by 17.9% compared to 
      conventional monitoring approaches. Nonetheless, several challenges persist, 
      including issues related to data standardization, algorithm transparency, and 
      patient privacy protection. These results underscore the necessity of adopting a 
      balanced implementation strategy that addresses both technical limitations and 
      ethical considerations, while upholding patient autonomy. This perspective 
      emphasizes the critical importance of multidisciplinary collaboration among 
      healthcare professionals, technology developers, and regulatory authorities in 
      establishing a comprehensive framework for AI deployment in clinical settings. By 
      demonstrating the capacity of AI-assisted clinical decision-making to enhance 
      healthcare quality and efficiency for elderly patients with diabetes, this study 
      makes a meaningful contribution to the evolving field of personalized medicine.

TI  - Development of explainable artificial intelligence based machine learning model 
      for predicting 30-day hospital readmission after renal transplantation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hospital readmission following renal transplantation significantly 
      impacts patient outcomes and healthcare resources. While machine learning 
      approaches offer promising solutions for risk prediction, their clinical 
      application often lacks interpretability. We developed an explainable artificial 
      intelligence (XAI) based supervised learning model to predict 30-day hospital 
      readmission risk following renal transplantation. METHODS: We conducted a 
      retrospective analysis of 588 renal transplant recipients at King Abdullah 
      International Medical Research Center, with a predominance of living donor 
      transplants (85.2%, n = 500). Our methodology included a four-stage machine 
      learning pipeline: data processing, feature preparation, model development using 
      stratified 5-fold cross-validation, and clinical validation. Multiple algorithms 
      were evaluated, with gradient boosting demonstrating superior performance. Model 
      interpretability was achieved through dual-approach analysis using SHAP (SHapley 
      Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic 
      Explanations). RESULTS: The gradient boosting model demonstrated strong 
      performance (AUC 0.837, 95% CI: 0.802-0.872) with accuracy of 0.796 ± 0.050 and 
      sensitivity of 0.388 ± 0.129. Length of hospital stay (38.0% contribution) and 
      post-transplant systolic blood pressure (30.0% contribution) emerged as primary 
      predictors, with differences between living and deceased donor subgroups. 
      Pre-transplant BMI showed a higher importance in deceased donor recipients (12.6% 
      vs. 2.6%), while HbA1c and eGFR were more impacting in living donor outcomes. The 
      readmission rate in our cohort (88.9%, n = 523) was higher than previously 
      reported ranges (18-47%), likely reflecting center-specific practices. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our XAI-based machine learning model combines strong predictive 
      performance with clinical interpretability, offering transplant physicians 
      donor-specific risk stratification capabilities. The web-based implementation 
      facilitates practical integration into clinical workflows. Given our 
      single-center experience and high proportion of living donors, external 
      validation across diverse transplant centers is essential before widespread 
      implementation. Our approach establishes a framework for developing 
      center-specific risk prediction tools in transplant medicine.

TI  - Multiparametric MRI for Assessment of the Biological Invasiveness and Prognosis 
      of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma in the Era of Artificial Intelligence.
PG  - 9-19
LID - 10.1002/jmri.29708 [doi]
AB  - Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the deadliest malignant tumor, with a 
      grim 5-year overall survival rate of about 12%. As its incidence and mortality 
      rates rise, it is likely to become the second-leading cause of cancer-related 
      death. The radiological assessment determined the stage and management of PDAC. 
      However, it is a highly heterogeneous disease with the complexity of the tumor 
      microenvironment, and it is challenging to adequately reflect the biological 
      aggressiveness and prognosis accurately through morphological evaluation alone. 
      With the dramatic development of artificial intelligence (AI), multiparametric 
      magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) using specific contrast media and special 
      techniques can provide morphological and functional information with high image 
      quality and become a powerful tool in quantifying intratumor characteristics. 
      Besides, AI has been widespread in the field of medical imaging analysis. 
      Radiomics is the high-throughput mining of quantitative image features from 
      medical imaging that enables data to be extracted and applied for better decision 
      support. Deep learning is a subset of artificial neural network algorithms that 
      can automatically learn feature representations from data. AI-enabled imaging 
      biomarkers of mpMRI have enormous promise to bridge the gap between medical 
      imaging and personalized medicine and demonstrate huge advantages in predicting 
      biological characteristics and the prognosis of PDAC. However, current AI-based 
      models of PDAC operate mainly in the realm of a single modality with a relatively 
      small sample size, and the technical reproducibility and biological 
      interpretation present a barrage of new potential challenges. In the future, the 
      integration of multi-omics data, such as radiomics and genomics, alongside the 
      establishment of standardized analytical frameworks will provide opportunities to 
      increase the robustness and interpretability of AI-enabled image biomarkers and 
      bring these biomarkers closer to clinical practice. EVIDENCE LEVEL: 3 TECHNICAL 
      EFFICACY: Stage 4.

TI  - Advancements in Radiomics-Based AI for Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.
LID - 10.3390/bioengineering12080849 [doi]
LID - 849
AB  - The advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning, and radiomics has 
      introduced novel methodologies for the detection, classification, prognosis, and 
      treatment evaluation of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). As the 
      integration of AI into medical imaging continues to evolve, its potential to 
      enhance early detection, refine diagnostic precision, and optimize treatment 
      strategies becomes increasingly evident. However, despite significant progress, 
      various challenges remain, particularly in terms of clinical applicability, 
      generalizability, interpretability, and integration into routine practice. 
      Understanding the current state of research is crucial for identifying gaps in 
      the literature and exploring opportunities for future advancements. This 
      literature review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the existing 
      studies on AI applications in PDAC, with a focus on disease detection, 
      classification, survival prediction, treatment response assessment, and 
      radiogenomics. By analyzing the methodologies, findings, and limitations of these 
      studies, we aim to highlight the strengths of AI-driven approaches while 
      addressing critical gaps that hinder their clinical translation. Furthermore, 
      this review aims to discuss future directions in the field, emphasizing the need 
      for multi-institutional collaborations, explainable AI models, and the 
      integration of multi-modal data to advance the role of AI in personalized 
      medicine for PDAC.

PG  - 4599

LID - 4599
AB  - Recent studies revealed that gut microbiota modulates the response to cancer 
      immunotherapy and fecal microbiota transplantation has clinical benefits in 
      melanoma patients during treatment. Understanding how microbiota affects 
      individual responses is crucial for precision oncology. However, it is 
      challenging to identify key microbial taxa with limited data as statistical and 
      machine learning models often lose their generalizability. In this study, 
      DeepGeni, a deep generalized interpretable autoencoder, is proposed to improve 
      the generalizability and interpretability of microbiome profiles by augmenting 
      data and by introducing interpretable links in the autoencoder. DeepGeni-based 
      machine learning classifier outperforms state-of-the-art classifier in the 
      microbiome-driven prediction of responsiveness of melanoma patients treated with 
      immune checkpoint inhibitors. Moreover, the interpretable links of DeepGeni 
      elucidate the most informative microbiota associated with cancer immunotherapy 
      response. DeepGeni not only improves microbiome-driven prediction of immune 
      checkpoint inhibitor responsiveness but also suggests potential microbial targets 
      for fecal microbiota transplant or probiotics improving the outcome of cancer 
      immunotherapy.

TI  - Smarter stem cells: how AI is supercharging iPSC technology.
LID - 10.1007/s00441-025-03999-7 [doi]
AB  - Integrated with artificial intelligence (AI), induced pluripotent stem cell 
      (iPSC) technology could enhance disease modeling, cellular biology, regenerative 
      medicine, and pharmaceutical development. AI has enhanced iPSC differentiation, 
      cultural conditions, and speed of disease-specific model development. 
      Furthermore, AI-based massive omics database analysis exposes hidden biological 
      tendencies, enhancing customized treatment. Investigating new AI algorithms will 
      enable one to solve problems, including interpretability and data quality, 
      resulting from AI's interaction with iPSC technology. These advances 
      fundamentally alter stem cell research and therapeutic applications, therefore 
      facilitating the emergence of regenerative medicine and precision healthcare. AI 
      has evolved in biomedical research into a transformational technology unique in 
      great data analysis, predictive modeling, and automation capacity. AI integration 
      increases the development of patient-specific cell types for disease modeling, 
      pharmacological research, and regenerative medicine by substantially improving 
      IPSC-based technologies. Emphasizing changes in disease models, alternative 
      methodologies, and cellular reprogramming, this work examines current 
      advancements in the use of AI in iPSC technology. The argument on significant 
      obstacles and possibilities reveals how AI could alter the objectives of iPSC 
      research and implementation.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a powerful tool in biochemistry, greatly 
      enhancing research capabilities by enabling the analysis of complex datasets, 
      predicting molecular interactions, and accelerating drug discovery. As AI 
      continues to evolve, its applications in biochemistry are poised to expand, 
      revolutionizing both theoretical and applied research. This review explores 
      current and potential AI applications in biochemistry, with a focus on data 
      analysis, molecular modeling, enzyme engineering, and metabolic pathway studies. 
      Key AI techniques-such as machine learning algorithms, natural language 
      processing, and AI-based molecular modeling-are discussed. The review also 
      highlights emerging research areas benefiting from AI, including personalized 
      medicine and synthetic biology. The methodology involves an extensive analysis of 
      existing literature, particularly peer-reviewed studies on AI applications in 
      biochemistry. AI-driven tools like AlphaFold, which have significantly advanced 
      protein structure prediction, are evaluated alongside AI's role in expediting 
      drug discovery. The review also addresses challenges such as data quality, model 
      interpretability, and ethical considerations. Results indicate that AI has 
      expanded the scope of biochemical research by facilitating large-scale data 
      analysis, enhancing molecular simulations, and opening new avenues of inquiry. 
      However, challenges remain, particularly in data handling and ethical concerns. 
      In conclusion, AI is transforming biochemistry by driving innovation and

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) and digital health technologies are increasingly 
      used in the medical field. Despite promises of leading the future of personalized 
      medicine and better clinical outcomes, implementation of AI faces barriers for 
      deployment at scale. We introduce a novel implementation framework that can 
      facilitate digital health designers, developers, patient groups, policymakers, 
      and other stakeholders, to co-create and solve issues throughout the life cycle 
      of designing, developing, deploying, monitoring, and maintaining algorithmic 
      models. This framework targets health systems that integrate multiple machine 
      learning (ML) models with various modalities. This design thinking approach 
      promotes clinical utility beyond model prediction, combining privacy preservation 
      with clinical parameters to establish a reward function for reinforcement 
      learning, ranking competing models. This allows leveraging explainable AI (xAI) 
      methods for clinical interpretability. Governance mechanisms and orchestration 
      platforms can be integrated to monitor and manage models. The proposed framework 
      guides users toward human-centered AI design and developing AI-enhanced health 
      system solutions.

AB  - The youth mental health crisis is exacerbated by limited access to care and 
      resources. Mobile health (mHealth) platforms using predictive artificial 
      intelligence (AI) can improve access and reduce barriers, enabling real-time 
      responses and precision prevention. This systematic review evaluates predictive 
      AI approaches in mHealth platforms for forecasting mental health symptoms among 
      youth (13-25 years). We searched studies from Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, 
      PsycInfo, and CENTRAL, to identify relevant studies. From 11 studies identified, 
      three studies predicted multiple symptoms, with depression being the most common 
      (63%). Most platforms used smartphones and 25% integrated wearables. Key 
      predictors included smartphone usage (N=5), sleep metrics (N=6), and physical 
      activity (N=5). Nuanced predictors like usage locations and sleep stages improved 
      prediction. Logistic regression was most used (N=6), followed by Support Vector 
      Machines (N=3) and ensemble methods (N=4). F-scores for anxiety and depression 
      ranged from 0.73 to 0.84, and AUCs from 0.50 to 0.74. Stress models had AUCs of 
      0.68 to 0.83. Bayesian model selection and Shapley values enhanced robustness and 
      interpretability. Barriers included small sample sizes, privacy concerns, missing 
      data, and underrepresentation bias. Rigorous evaluation of predictive 
      performance, generalizability, and user engagement is critical before mHealth 
      platforms are integrated into psychiatric care.

TI  - A comparison of machine learning models for predicting urinary incontinence in 
      men with localized prostate cancer.
PG  - 1168219
LID - 10.3389/fonc.2023.1168219 [doi]
LID - 1168219
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Urinary incontinence (UI) is a common side effect of prostate 
      cancer treatment, but in clinical practice, it is difficult to predict. Machine 
      learning (ML) models have shown promising results in predicting outcomes, yet the 
      lack of transparency in complex models known as "black-box" has made clinicians 
      wary of relying on them in sensitive decisions. Therefore, finding a balance 
      between accuracy and explainability is crucial for the implementation of ML 
      models. The aim of this study was to employ three different ML classifiers to 
      predict the probability of experiencing UI in men with localized prostate cancer 
      1-year and 2-year after treatment and compare their accuracy and explainability. 
      METHODS: We used the ProZIB dataset from the Netherlands Comprehensive Cancer 
      Organization (Integraal Kankercentrum Nederland; IKNL) which contained clinical, 
      demographic, and PROM data of 964 patients from 65 Dutch hospitals. Logistic 
      Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms 
      were applied to predict (in)continence after prostate cancer treatment. RESULTS: 
      All models have been externally validated according to the TRIPOD Type 3 
      guidelines and their performance was assessed by accuracy, sensitivity, 
      specificity, and AUC. While all three models demonstrated similar performance, LR 
      showed slightly better accuracy than RF and SVM in predicting the risk of UI one 
      year after prostate cancer treatment, achieving an accuracy of 0.75, a 
      sensitivity of 0.82, and an AUC of 0.79. All models for the 2-year outcome 
      performed poorly in the validation set, with an accuracy of 0.6 for LR, 0.65 for 
      RF, and 0.54 for SVM. CONCLUSION: The outcomes of our study demonstrate the 
      promise of using non-black box models, such as LR, to assist clinicians in 
      recognizing high-risk patients and making informed treatment choices. The 
      coefficients of the LR model show the importance of each feature in predicting 
      results, and the generated nomogram provides an accessible illustration of how 
      each feature impacts the predicted outcome. Additionally, the model's simplicity 
      and interpretability make it a more appropriate option in scenarios where 
      comprehending the model's predictions is essential.

TI  - Predicting Pain Response to a Remote Musculoskeletal Care Program for Low Back 
      Pain Management: Development of a Prediction Tool.
PG  - e64806
LID - 10.2196/64806 [doi]
LID - e64806
AB  - BACKGROUND: Low back pain (LBP) presents with diverse manifestations, 
      necessitating personalized treatment approaches that recognize various phenotypes 
      within the same diagnosis, which could be achieved through precision medicine. 
      Although prediction strategies have been explored, including those employing 
      artificial intelligence (AI), they still lack scalability and real-time 
      capabilities. Digital care programs (DCPs) facilitate seamless data collection 
      through the Internet of Things and cloud storage, creating an ideal environment 
      for developing and implementing an AI predictive tool to assist clinicians in 
      dynamically optimizing treatment. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop an AI 
      tool that continuously assists physical therapists in predicting an individual's 
      potential for achieving clinically significant pain relief by the end of the 
      program. A secondary aim was to identify predictors of pain nonresponse to guide 
      treatment adjustments. METHODS: Data collected actively (eg, demographic and 
      clinical information) and passively in real-time (eg, range of motion, exercise 
      performance, and socioeconomic data from public data sources) from 6125 patients 
      enrolled in a remote digital musculoskeletal intervention program were stored in 
      the cloud. Two machine learning techniques, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and 
      light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), continuously analyzed session updates 
      up to session 7 to predict the likelihood of achieving significant pain relief at 
      the program end. Model performance was assessed using the area under the receiver 
      operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC), precision-recall curves, specificity, 
      and sensitivity. Model explainability was assessed using SHapley Additive 
      exPlanations values. RESULTS: At each session, the model provided a prediction 
      about the potential of being a pain responder, with performance improving over 
      time (P<.001). By session 7, the RNN achieved an ROC-AUC of 0.70 (95% CI 
      0.65-0.71), and the LightGBM achieved an ROC-AUC of 0.71 (95% CI 0.67-0.72). Both 
      models demonstrated high specificity in scenarios prioritizing high precision. 
      The key predictive features were pain-associated domains, exercise performance, 
      motivation, and compliance, informing continuous treatment adjustments to 
      maximize response rates. CONCLUSIONS: This study underscores the potential of an 
      AI predictive tool within a DCP to enhance the management of LBP, supporting 
      physical therapists in redirecting care pathways early and throughout the 
      treatment course. This approach is particularly important for addressing the 
      heterogeneous phenotypes observed in LBP. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov

AB  - Machine learning methods can detect complex relationships between variables, but 
      usually do not exploit domain knowledge. This is a limitation because in many 
      scientific disciplines, such as systems biology, domain knowledge is available in 
      the form of graphs or networks, and its use can improve model performance. We 
      need network-based algorithms that are versatile and applicable in many research 
      areas. In this work, we demonstrate subnetwork detection based on multi-modal 
      node features using a novel Greedy Decision Forest (GDF) with inherent 
      interpretability. The latter will be a crucial factor to retain experts and gain 
      their trust in such algorithms. To demonstrate a concrete application example, we 
      focus on bioinformatics, systems biology and particularly biomedicine, but the 
      presented methodology is applicable in many other domains as well. Systems 
      biology is a good example of a field in which statistical data-driven machine 
      learning enables the analysis of large amounts of multi-modal biomedical data. 
      This is important to reach the future goal of precision medicine, where the 
      complexity of patients is modeled on a system level to best tailor medical 
      decisions, health practices and therapies to the individual patient. Our proposed 
      explainable approach can help to uncover disease-causing network modules from 
      multi-omics data to better understand complex diseases such as cancer.

TI  - Artificial intelligence-assisted analysis of musculoskeletal imaging-A narrative 
      review of the current state of machine learning models.
PG  - 3032-3038
LID - 10.1002/ksa.12702 [doi]
AB  - The potential of Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly recognized in 
      musculoskeletal radiology, offering solutions to challenges posed by increasing 
      imaging volumes and fellowship trained radiologist shortages. The integration of 
      AI is not intended to replace radiologists but to augment their capabilities, 
      improving workflow efficiency and diagnostic accuracy. This narrative review 
      examines the current landscape of AI applications in musculoskeletal imaging, 
      focusing on both general-purpose multimodal models and specialized foundation 
      models. AI has proven effective in musculoskeletal imaging, enhancing fracture 
      detection, scoliosis assessment, and lower limb alignment analysis. In 
      osteoarthritis, AI aids early detection by identifying subtle structural changes. 
      AI-accelerated MRI reconstruction reduces scan times by up to 90% while 
      maintaining diagnostic quality, improving efficiency and accessibility. Emerging 
      multimodal models further integrate imaging with clinical data, advancing 
      precision medicine. Technical challenges persist, particularly in addressing 
      motion artifacts and anatomical complexity. Ethical considerations, including 
      data privacy, algorithmic bias, and model transparency, remain crucial for 
      responsible implementation. While challenges remain in clinical validation and 
      implementation, the combination of broad and narrow AI models shows promise in 
      advancing precision medicine and democratizing quality care. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE:

TI  - Personalized Medical Approach in Gastrointestinal Surgical Oncology: Current 
      Trends and Future Perspectives.
LID - 10.3390/jpm15050175 [doi]
LID - 175
AB  - Advances in artificial intelligence (AI), multi-omic profiling, and sophisticated 
      imaging technologies have significantly advanced personalized medicine in 
      gastrointestinal surgical oncology. These technological innovations enable 
      precise patient stratification, tailored surgical strategies, and individualized 
      therapeutic approaches, thereby significantly enhancing clinical outcomes. 
      Despite remarkable progress, challenges persist, including the standardization 
      and integration of diverse data types, ethical concerns regarding patient 
      privacy, and rigorous clinical validation of predictive models. Addressing these 
      challenges requires establishing international standards for data 
      interoperability, such as Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources, and 
      adopting advanced security methods, such as homomorphic encryption, to facilitate 
      secure multi-institutional data sharing. Moreover, ensuring model transparency 
      and explainability through techniques such as explainable AI is critical for 
      fostering trust among clinicians and patients. The successful integration of 
      these advanced technologies necessitates strong multidisciplinary collaboration 
      among surgeons, radiologists, geneticists, pathologists, and oncologists. 
      Ultimately, the continued development and effective implementation of these 
      personalized medical strategies complemented by human expertise promise a 
      transformative shift toward patient-centered care, improving long-term outcomes 
      for patients with gastrointestinal cancer.

TI  - Incorporating Uncertainty Estimation and Interpretability in Personalized Glucose 
      Prediction Using the Temporal Fusion Transformer.
LID - 10.3390/s25154647 [doi]
LID - 4647
AB  - More than 14% of the world's population suffered from diabetes mellitus in 2022. 
      This metabolic condition is defined by increased blood glucose concentrations. 
      Among the different types of diabetes, type 1 diabetes, caused by a lack of 
      insulin secretion, is particularly challenging to treat. In this regard, 
      automatic glucose level estimation implements Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) 
      devices, showing positive therapeutic outcomes. AI-based glucose prediction has 
      commonly followed a deterministic approach, usually with a lack of 
      interpretability. Therefore, these AI-based methods do not provide enough 
      information in critical decision-making scenarios, like in the medical field. 
      This work intends to provide accurate, interpretable, and personalized glucose 
      prediction using the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), and also includes an 
      uncertainty estimation. The TFT was trained using two databases, an 
      in-house-collected dataset and the OhioT1DM dataset, commonly used for glucose 
      forecasting benchmarking. For both datasets, the set of input features to train 
      the model was varied to assess their impact on model interpretability and 
      prediction performance. Models were evaluated using common prediction metrics, 
      diabetes-specific metrics, uncertainty estimation, and interpretability of the 
      model, including feature importance and attention. The obtained results showed 
      that TFT outperforms existing methods in terms of RMSE by at least 13% for both 
      datasets.

TI  - Explainable AI enables clinical trial patient selection to retrospectively 
      improve treatment effects in schizophrenia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Heterogeneity among patients' responses to treatment is prevalent in 
      psychiatric disorders. Personalized medicine approaches-which involve parsing 
      patients into subgroups better indicated for a particular treatment-could 
      therefore improve patient outcomes and serve as a powerful tool in patient 
      selection within clinical trials. Machine learning approaches can identify 
      patient subgroups but are often not "explainable" due to the use of complex 
      algorithms that do not mirror clinicians' natural decision-making processes. 
      METHODS: Here we combine two analytical approaches-Personalized Advantage Index 
      and Bayesian Rule Lists-to identify paliperidone-indicated schizophrenia patients 
      in a way that emphasizes model explainability. We apply these approaches 
      retrospectively to randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial data to identify 
      a paliperidone-indicated subgroup of schizophrenia patients who demonstrate a 
      larger treatment effect (outcome on treatment superior than on placebo) than that 
      of the full randomized sample as assessed with Cohen's d. For this study, the 
      outcome corresponded to a reduction in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale 
      (PANSS) total score which measures positive (e.g., hallucinations, delusions), 
      negative (e.g., blunted affect, emotional withdrawal), and general 
      psychopathological (e.g., disturbance of volition, uncooperativeness) symptoms in 
      schizophrenia. RESULTS: Using our combined explainable AI approach to identify a 
      subgroup more responsive to paliperidone than placebo, the treatment effect 
      increased significantly over that of the full sample (p < 0.0001 for a one-sample 
      t-test comparing the full sample Cohen's d = 0.82 and a generated distribution of 
      subgroup Cohen's d's with mean d = 1.22, std d = 0.09). In addition, our modeling 
      approach produces simple logical statements (if-then-else), termed a "rule list", 
      to ease interpretability for clinicians. A majority of the rule lists generated 
      from cross-validation found two general psychopathology symptoms, disturbance of 
      volition and uncooperativeness, to predict membership in the 
      paliperidone-indicated subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: These results help to technically 
      validate our explainable AI approach to patient selection for a clinical trial by 
      identifying a subgroup with an improved treatment effect. With these data, the 
      explainable rule lists also suggest that paliperidone may provide an improved 
      therapeutic benefit for the treatment of schizophrenia patients with either of 
      the symptoms of high disturbance of volition or high uncooperativeness. TRIAL

TI  - FN-OCT: Disease Detection Algorithm for Retinal Optical Coherence Tomography 
      Based on a Fusion Network.
PG  - 876927
LID - 10.3389/fninf.2022.876927 [doi]
LID - 876927
AB  - Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a new type of tomography that has 
      experienced rapid development and potential in recent years. It is playing an 
      increasingly important role in retinopathy diagnoses. At present, due to the 
      uneven distributions of medical resources in various regions, the uneven 
      proficiency levels of doctors in grassroots and remote areas, and the development 
      needs of rare disease diagnosis and precision medicine, artificial intelligence 
      technology based on deep learning can provide fast, accurate, and effective 
      solutions for the recognition and diagnosis of retinal OCT images. To prevent 
      vision damage and blindness caused by the delayed discovery of retinopathy, a 
      fusion network (FN)-based retinal OCT classification algorithm (FN-OCT) is 
      proposed in this paper to improve upon the adaptability and accuracy of 
      traditional classification algorithms. The InceptionV3, Inception-ResNet, and 
      Xception deep learning algorithms are used as base classifiers, a convolutional 
      block attention mechanism (CBAM) is added after each base classifier, and three 
      different fusion strategies are used to merge the prediction results of the base 
      classifiers to output the final prediction results (choroidal neovascularization 
      (CNV), diabetic macular oedema (DME), drusen, normal). The results show that in a 
      classification problem involving the UCSD common retinal OCT dataset (108,312 OCT 
      images from 4,686 patients), compared with that of the InceptionV3 network model, 
      the prediction accuracy of FN-OCT is improved by 5.3% (accuracy = 98.7%, area 
      under the curve (AUC) = 99.1%). The predictive accuracy and AUC achieved on an 
      external dataset for the classification of retinal OCT diseases are 92 and 94.5%, 
      respectively, and gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) is used 
      as a visualization tool to verify the effectiveness of the proposed FNs. This 
      finding indicates that the developed fusion algorithm can significantly improve 
      the performance of classifiers while providing a powerful tool and theoretical 
      support for assisting with the diagnosis of retinal OCT.

AB  - PURPOSE: This review aims to comprehensively explore the application of 
      Artificial Intelligence (AI) to an area that has not been traditionally explored 
      in depth: the continuum of maternal-fetal health. In doing so, the intent was to 
      examine this physiologically continuous spectrum of mother and child health, as 
      well as to highlight potential pitfalls, and suggest solutions for the same. 
      METHOD: A systematic search identified studies employing AI techniques for 
      prediction, diagnosis, and decision support employing various modalities like 
      imaging, electrophysiological signals and electronic health records in the domain 
      of obstetrics and fetal health. In the selected articles then, AI applications in 
      fetal morphology, gestational age assessment, congenital defect detection, fetal 
      monitoring, placental analysis, and maternal physiological monitoring were 
      critically examined both from the perspective of the domain and artificial 
      intelligence. RESULT: AI-driven solutions demonstrate promising capabilities in 
      medical diagnostics and risk prediction, offering automation, improved accuracy, 
      and the potential for personalized medicine. However, challenges regarding data 
      availability, algorithmic transparency, and ethical considerations must be 
      overcome to ensure responsible and effective clinical implementation. These 
      challenges must be urgently addressed to ensure a domain as critical to public 
      health as obstetrics and fetal health, is able to fully benefit from the gigantic 
      strides made in the field of artificial intelligence. CONCLUSION: Open access to 
      relevant datasets is crucial for equitable progress in this critical public 
      health domain. Integrating responsible and explainable AI, while addressing 
      ethical considerations, is essential to maximize the public health benefits of 
      AI-driven solutions in maternal-fetal care.

AB  - The landscape of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) diagnostics is undergoing a pivotal 
      shift towards a transformative era, driven by the integration of artificial 
      intelligence (AI). This review delves into the pivotal role of AI in reshaping 
      AML diagnostics in the 21st century, highlighting advancements, challenges, and 
      future prospects. AML, marked by the immediate need for accurate diagnosis and 
      treatment, requires precise analysis against the complexity of various diagnostic 
      methods such as cytomorphology, immunophenotyping, cytogenetics, and molecular 
      testing. The introduction of AI in this field promises to address the critical 
      need for rapid and standardized diagnostics, thereby enhancing patient care. AI 
      technologies, including deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML), are 
      revolutionizing the interpretation of complex diagnostic data. With the use of 
      AI-based models such as deep learning (DL) classifiers or automated karyotyping, 
      promising tools do already exist. When it comes to reporting and reasoning, large 
      language models (LLM) show their potential in efficient data processing and 
      better clinical decision-making. This includes the use of large language models 
      (LLMs) for generating comprehensive diagnostic reports that integrate 
      multi-layered diagnostic information. However, there is a critical need for 
      transparency and interpretability in AI-driven diagnostics. Explainable AI (XAI) 
      models address this need building trust among clinicians and patients. Moreover, 
      this review addresses the growing field of synthetic data that are becoming 
      increasingly accessible due to advances in AI and computational technology. While 
      synthetic data present a promising avenue for augmenting clinical research and 
      potentially optimizing clinical trials in fields such as AML, their application 
      requires careful ethical, regulatory, and methodological considerations. There 
      are several limitations and challenges to consider regarding not only synthetic 
      data but also AI models in general. This includes regulatory hurdles due to the 
      dynamic nature of AI, as well as data privacy concerns and interoperability 
      between different systems. In conclusion, AI has the potential to completely 
      change how we diagnose and treat AML by offering faster, more accurate, and more 
      comprehensive diagnostic insights. This potential is especially crucial for 
      preserving knowledge in times of shortages of human experts. However, realizing 
      this potential will require overcoming significant challenges and fostering 
      collaboration between technologists and clinicians. As we move forward, the 
      synergy between AI and human expertise will undoubtedly redefine the landscape of 
      AML diagnostics, leading in a new era of precision medicine in hematology.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the landscape of laboratory medicine 
      by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and enabling more personalized care. Given its 
      growing use in clinical settings, evaluating the performance of AI models in 
      diagnostic tasks is essential to inform evidence-based implementation strategies. 
      This meta-analysis systematically assessed the diagnostic effectiveness of 
      AI-based models. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, 
      Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore using predefined keywords related to AI 
      and diagnostic accuracy. From 430 retrieved studies, 17 met the inclusion 
      criteria. Data extracted included study design, AI model type, input modality, 
      and performance metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, and area under the 
      curve (AUC). Random-effects meta-analysis and subgroup analyses were performed to 
      investigate heterogeneity and model-specific trends. The pooled analysis yielded 
      a high combined AUC of 0.9025, indicating strong diagnostic capability of AI 
      models. However, substantial heterogeneity was detected (I(2) = 91.01%), 
      attributed to differences in model architecture, diagnostic domains, and data 
      quality. Subgroup analyses showed that convolutional neural networks and random 
      forest models achieved higher AUC values, while domains like endocrinology 
      demonstrated greater performance variability. Funnel plot inspection and 
      sensitivity analysis indicated the presence of publication bias. AI shows strong 
      potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy in personalized laboratory medicine. 
      Nonetheless, methodological heterogeneity and publication bias remain significant 
      challenges. Future research should prioritize standardized evaluation frameworks, 
      transparency, and the development of explainable AI systems to ensure responsible 
      clinical integration.

TI  - Automatic Detection and Classification of Epileptic Seizures from EEG Data: 
      Finding Optimal Acquisition Settings and Testing Interpretable Machine Learning 
      Approach.
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines11092370 [doi]

AB  - Deep learning (DL) is emerging as a successful technique for automatic detection 
      and differentiation of spontaneous seizures that may otherwise be missed or 
      misclassified. Herein, we propose a system architecture based on top-performing 
      DL models for binary and multigroup classifications with the non-overlapping 
      window technique, which we tested on the TUSZ dataset. The system accurately 
      detects seizure episodes (87.7% Sn, 91.16% Sp) and carefully distinguishes eight 
      seizure types (95-100% Acc). An increase in EEG sampling rate from 50 to 250 Hz 
      boosted model performance: the precision of seizure detection rose by 5%, and 
      seizure differentiation by 7%. A low sampling rate is a reasonable solution for 
      training reliable models with EEG data. Decreasing the number of EEG electrodes 
      from 21 to 8 did not affect seizure detection but worsened seizure 
      differentiation significantly: 98.24 ± 0.17 vs. 85.14 ± 3.14% recall. In 
      detecting epileptic episodes, all electrodes provided equally informative input, 
      but in seizure differentiation, their informative value varied. We improved model 
      explainability with interpretable ML. Activation maximization highlighted the 
      presence of EEG patterns specific to eight seizure types. Cortical projection of 
      epileptic sources depicted differences between generalized and focal seizures. 
      Interpretable ML techniques confirmed that our system recognizes biologically 
      meaningful features as indicators of epileptic activity in EEG.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has a multitude of applications in cancer research 
      and oncology. However, the training of AI systems is impeded by the limited 
      availability of large datasets due to data protection requirements and other 
      regulatory obstacles. Federated and swarm learning represent possible solutions 
      to this problem by collaboratively training AI models while avoiding data 
      transfer. However, in these decentralized methods, weight updates are still 
      transferred to the aggregation server for merging the models. This leaves the 
      possibility for a breach of data privacy, for example by model inversion or 
      membership inference attacks by untrusted servers. 
      Somewhat-homomorphically-encrypted federated learning (SHEFL) is a solution to 
      this problem because only encrypted weights are transferred, and model updates 
      are performed in the encrypted space. Here, we demonstrate the first successful 
      implementation of SHEFL in a range of clinically relevant tasks in cancer image 
      analysis on multicentric datasets in radiology and histopathology. We show that 
      SHEFL enables the training of AI models which outperform locally trained models 
      and perform on par with models which are centrally trained. In the future, SHEFL 
      can enable multiple institutions to co-train AI models without forsaking data 
      governance and without ever transmitting any decryptable data to untrusted 
      servers.

AB  - Modern healthcare depends fundamentally on clinical biochemistry for disease 
      diagnosis and therapeutic guidance. The discipline encounters operational 
      constraints, including sampling inefficiencies, precision limitations, and 
      expansion difficulties. Recent advancements in established technologies, such as 
      mass spectrometry and the development of high-throughput screening and 
      point-of-care technologies, are revolutionizing the industry. Modern biosensor 
      technology and wearable monitors facilitate continuous health tracking, 
      Artificial Intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) applications enhance 
      analytical capabilities, generating predictive insights for individualized 
      treatment protocols. However, concerns regarding algorithmic bias, data privacy, 
      lack of transparency in decision-making ("black box" models), and over-reliance 
      on automated systems pose significant challenges that must be addressed for 
      responsible AI integration. However, significant limitations remain-substantial 
      implementation expenses, system incompatibility issues, and information security 
      vulnerabilities intersect with ethical considerations regarding algorithmic 
      fairness and protected health information. Addressing these challenges demands 
      coordinated efforts between clinicians, scientists, and technical specialists. 
      This review discusses current challenges in clinical biochemistry, explicitly 
      addressing the limitations of reference intervals and barriers to implementing 
      innovative biomarkers in medical settings. The discussion evaluates how advanced 
      technologies and multidisciplinary collaboration can overcome these constraints 
      while identifying research priorities to enhance diagnostic precision and 
      accessibility for better healthcare delivery.

TI  - Enhancing Thrombophilia Risk Prediction Through AI-Based Methodologies.
PG  - 125-126
LID - 10.3233/SHTI240073 [doi]
AB  - Thrombophilia, a predisposition to thrombosis, poses significant diagnostic 
      challenges due to its multi-factorial nature, encompassing genetic and acquired 
      factors. Current diagnostic paradigms, primarily relying on a combination of 
      clinical assessment and targeted laboratory tests, often fail to capture the 
      complex interplay of factors contributing to thrombophilia risk. This paper 
      proposes an innovative artificial intelligence (AI)-based methodology aimed to 
      enhance the prediction of thrombophilia risk. The designed multidimensional risk 
      assessment model integrates and elaborates through AI a comprehensive collection 
      of patient data types, including genetic markers, clinical parameters, patient 
      history, and lifestyle factors, in order to obtain advanced and personalized 
      explainable diagnoses.

TI  - Addressing the Challenges and Barriers to the Integration of Machine Learning 
      into Clinical Practice: An Innovative Method to Hybrid Human-Machine 
      Intelligence.
LID - 10.3390/s22218313 [doi]
LID - 8313
AB  - Machine learning (ML) models have proven their potential in acquiring and 
      analyzing large amounts of data to help solve real-world, complex problems. Their 
      use in healthcare is expected to help physicians make diagnoses, prognoses, 
      treatment decisions, and disease outcome predictions. However, ML solutions are 
      not currently deployed in most healthcare systems. One of the main reasons for 
      this is the provenance, transparency, and clinical utility of the training data. 
      Physicians reject ML solutions if they are not at least based on accurate data 
      and do not clearly include the decision-making process used in clinical practice. 
      In this paper, we present a hybrid human-machine intelligence method to create 
      predictive models driven by clinical practice. We promote the use of 
      quality-approved data and the inclusion of physician reasoning in the ML process. 
      Instead of training the ML algorithms on the given data to create predictive 
      models (conventional method), we propose to pre-categorize the data according to 
      the expert physicians' knowledge and experience. Comparing the results of the 
      conventional method of ML learning versus the hybrid physician-algorithm method 
      showed that the models based on the latter can perform better. Physicians' 
      engagement is the most promising condition for the safe and innovative use of ML 
      in healthcare.

TI  - Rule ensemble method with adaptive group lasso for heterogeneous treatment effect 
      estimation.
PG  - 3413-3442
LID - 10.1002/sim.9812 [doi]
AB  - The increasing scientific attention given to precision medicine based on 
      real-world data has led to many recent studies clarifying the relationships 
      between treatment effects and patient characteristics. However, this is 
      challenging because of ubiquitous heterogeneity in the treatment effect for 
      individuals and the real-world data on their backgrounds being complex and noisy. 
      Because of their flexibility, various machine learning (ML) methods have been 
      proposed for estimating heterogeneous treatment effect (HTE). However, most ML 
      methods incorporate black-box models that hamper direct interpretation of the 
      relationships between an individual's characteristics and treatment effects. This 
      study proposes an ML method for estimating HTE based on the rule ensemble method 
      RuleFit. The main advantages of RuleFit are interpretability and accuracy. 
      However, HTEs are always defined in the potential outcome framework, and RuleFit 
      cannot be applied directly. Thus, we modified RuleFit and proposed a method to 
      estimate HTEs that directly interpret the relationships among the individuals' 
      features from the model. Actual data from an HIV study, the ACTG 175 dataset, was 
      used to illustrate the interpretation based on the ensemble of rules created by 
      the proposed method. The numerical results confirm that the proposed method has 
      high prediction accuracy compared to previous methods, indicating that the 
      proposed method establishes an interpretable model with sufficient prediction 
      accuracy.

LID - bbab291
AB  - Application of machine and deep learning methods in drug discovery and cancer 
      research has gained a considerable amount of attention in the past years. As the 
      field grows, it becomes crucial to systematically evaluate the performance of 
      novel computational solutions in relation to established techniques. To this end, 
      we compare rule-based and data-driven molecular representations in prediction of 
      drug combination sensitivity and drug synergy scores using standardized results 
      of 14 high-throughput screening studies, comprising 64 200 unique combinations of 
      4153 molecules tested in 112 cancer cell lines. We evaluate the clustering 
      performance of molecular representations and quantify their similarity by 
      adapting the Centered Kernel Alignment metric. Our work demonstrates that to 
      identify an optimal molecular representation type, it is necessary to supplement 
      quantitative benchmark results with qualitative considerations, such as model 
      interpretability and robustness, which may vary between and throughout 
      preclinical drug development projects.

TI  - Comparison of multivariate linear regression and a machine learning algorithm 
      developed for prediction of precision warfarin dosing in a Korean population.
PG  - 1676-1686
LID - 10.1111/jth.15318 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Personalized warfarin dosing is influenced by various factors 
      including genetic and non-genetic factors. Multiple linear regression (LR) is 
      known as a conventional method to develop predictive models. Recently, machine 
      learning approaches have been extensively implemented for warfarin dosing due to 
      the hypothesis of non-linear association between covariates and stable warfarin 
      dose. OBJECTIVE: To extend the multiple linear regression algorithm for 
      personalized warfarin dosing in a Korean population and compare with a machine 
      learning--based algorithm. METHOD: From this cohort study, we collected 
      information on 650 patients taking warfarin who achieved steady state including 
      demographic information, indications, comorbidities, comedications, habits, and 
      genetic factors. The dataset was randomly split into training set (90%) and test 
      set (10%). The LR and machine learning (gradient boosting machine [GBM]) models 
      were developed on the training set and were evaluated on the test set. RESULT: LR 
      and GBM models were comparable in terms of accuracy of ideal dose (75.38% and 
      73.85%), correlation (0.77 and 0.73), mean absolute error (0.58 mg/day and 
      0.64 mg/day), and root mean square error (0.82 mg/day and 0.9 mg/day), 
      respectively. VKORC1 genotype, CYP2C9 genotype, age, and weight were the highest 
      contributors and could obtain 80% of maximum performance in both models. 
      CONCLUSION: This study shows that our LR and GMB models are satisfactory to 
      predict warfarin dose in our dataset. Both models showed similar performance and 
      feature contribution characteristics. LR may be the appropriate model due to its 
      simplicity and interpretability.

TI  - Reinforcement Learning and Its Clinical Applications Within Healthcare: A 
      Systematic Review of Precision Medicine and Dynamic Treatment Regimes.
LID - 10.3390/healthcare13141752 [doi]
LID - 1752
AB  - Background/Objectives: Reinforcement learning (RL), a subset of machine learning, 
      has emerged as a promising tool for supporting precision medicine and dynamic 
      treatment regimes by enabling adaptive, data-driven clinical decision making. 
      Despite its potential, challenges such as interpretability, reward definition, 
      data limitations, and clinician adoption remain. This review aims to evaluate the 
      recent advancements in RL in precision medicine and dynamic treatment regimes, 
      highlight clinical fields of application, and propose practical frameworks for 
      future integration into medical practice. Methods: A systematic review was 
      conducted following PRISMA guidelines across PubMed, MEDLINE, and Web of Science 
      databases, focusing on studies from January 2014 to December 2024. Articles were 
      included based on their relevance to RL applications in precision medicine and 
      dynamic treatment regime within healthcare. Data extraction captured study 
      characteristics, algorithms used, specialty area, and outcomes. Results: 
      Forty-six studies met the inclusion criteria. RL applications were concentrated 
      in endocrinology, critical care, oncology, and behavioral health, with a focus on 
      dynamic and personalized treatment planning. Hybrid and value-based RL methods 
      were the most utilized. Since 2020, there has been a sharp increase in RL 
      research in healthcare, driven by advances in computational power, digital health 
      technologies, and increased use of wearable devices. Conclusions: RL offers a 
      powerful opportunity to augment clinical decision making by enabling dynamic and 
      individualized patient care. Addressing key barriers related to transparency, 
      data availability, and alignment with clinical workflows will be critical to 
      translating RL into everyday medical practice.

AB  - This paper proposes an architecture of the system that provides support for 
      collaborative research focused on analysis of data acquired using Triggerfish 
      contact lens sensor and devices for continuous monitoring of cardiovascular 
      system properties. The system enables application of machine learning (ML) models 
      for glaucoma diagnosis without direct intraocular pressure measurement and 
      independently of complex imaging techniques used in clinical practice. We 
      describe development of ML models based on sensor data and measurements of 
      corneal biomechanical properties. Application scenarios involve collection, 
      sharing and analysis of multi-sensor data. We give a view of issues concerning 
      interpretability and evaluation of ML model predictions. We also refer to the 
      problems related to personalized medicine and transdisciplinary research. The 
      system can be a base for community-wide initiative including ophthalmologists, 
      data scientists and machine learning experts that has the potential to leverage 
      data acquired by the devices to understand glaucoma risk factors and the 
      processes related to progression of the disease.

TI  - Machine learning models on a web application to predict short-term postoperative 
      outcomes following anterior cervical discectomy and fusion.
PG  - 401
LID - 10.1186/s12891-024-07528-5 [doi]
LID - 401
AB  - BACKGROUND: The frequency of anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) has 
      increased up to 400% since 2011, underscoring the need to preoperatively 
      anticipate adverse postoperative outcomes given the procedure's expanding use. 
      Our study aims to accomplish two goals: firstly, to develop a suite of 
      explainable machine learning (ML) models capable of predicting adverse 
      postoperative outcomes following ACDF surgery, and secondly, to embed these 
      models in a user-friendly web application, demonstrating their potential utility. 
      METHODS: We utilized data from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program 
      database to identify patients who underwent ACDF surgery. The outcomes of 
      interest were four short-term postoperative adverse outcomes: prolonged length of 
      stay (LOS), non-home discharges, 30-day readmissions, and major complications. We 
      utilized five ML algorithms - TabPFN, TabNET, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Random 
      Forest - coupled with the Optuna optimization library for hyperparameter tuning. 
      To bolster the interpretability of our models, we employed SHapley Additive 
      exPlanations (SHAP) for evaluating predictor variables' relative importance and 
      used partial dependence plots to illustrate the impact of individual variables on 
      the predictions generated by our top-performing models. We visualized model 
      performance using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and 
      precision-recall curves (PRC). Quantitative metrics calculated were the area 
      under the ROC curve (AUROC), balanced accuracy, weighted area under the PRC 
      (AUPRC), weighted precision, and weighted recall. Models with the highest AUROC 
      values were selected for inclusion in a web application. RESULTS: The analysis 
      included 57,760 patients for prolonged LOS [11.1% with prolonged LOS], 57,780 for 
      non-home discharges [3.3% non-home discharges], 57,790 for 30-day readmissions 
      [2.9% readmitted], and 57,800 for major complications [1.4% with major 
      complications]. The top-performing models, which were the ones built with the 
      Random Forest algorithm, yielded mean AUROCs of 0.776, 0.846, 0.775, and 0.747 
      for predicting prolonged LOS, non-home discharges, readmissions, and 
      complications, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our study employs advanced ML 
      methodologies to enhance the prediction of adverse postoperative outcomes 
      following ACDF. We designed an accessible web application to integrate these 
      models into clinical practice. Our findings affirm that ML tools serve as vital 
      supplements in risk stratification, facilitating the prediction of diverse 
      outcomes and enhancing patient counseling for ACDF.

TI  - Machine Learning for Predicting Biologic Agent Efficacy in Ulcerative Colitis: An 
      Analysis for Generalizability and Combination with Computational Models.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics14131324 [doi]
LID - 1324
AB  - Machine learning (ML) has been applied to predict the efficacy of biologic agents 
      in ulcerative colitis (UC). ML can offer precision, personalization, efficiency, 
      and automation. Moreover, it can improve decision support in predicting clinical 
      outcomes. However, it faces challenges related to data quality and quantity, 
      overfitting, generalization, and interpretability. This paper comments on two 
      recent ML models that predict the efficacy of vedolizumab and ustekinumab in UC. 
      Models that consider multiple pathways, multiple ethnicities, and combinations of 
      real-world and clinical trial data are required for optimal shared 
      decision-making and precision medicine. This paper also highlights the potential 
      of combining ML with computational models to enhance clinical outcomes and 
      personalized healthcare. Key Insights: (1) ML offers precision, personalization, 
      efficiency, and decision support for predicting the efficacy of biologic agents 
      in UC. (2) Challenging aspects in ML prediction include data quality, 
      overfitting, and interpretability. (3) Multiple pathways, multiple ethnicities, 
      and combinations of real-world and clinical trial data should be considered in 
      predictive models for optimal decision-making. (4) Combining ML with 
      computational models may improve clinical outcomes and personalized healthcare.

AB  - Accurate segmentation of lung tumors is essential for advancing personalized 
      medicine in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, stage IV NSCLC presents 
      significant challenges due to heterogeneous tumor morphology and the presence of 
      associated conditions including infection, atelectasis and pleural effusion. The 
      complexity of multicentric datasets further complicates robust segmentation 
      across diverse clinical settings. In this study, we evaluate deep-learning-based 
      approaches for automated segmentation of advanced-stage lung tumors using 3D 
      architectures on 387 CT scans from the Deep-Lung-IV study. Through comprehensive 
      experiments, we assess the impact of model design, HU windowing, and dataset size 
      on delineation performance, providing practical guidelines for robust 
      implementation. Additionally, we propose a confidence score using deep ensembles 
      to quantify prediction uncertainty and automate the identification of complex 
      cases that require further review. Our results demonstrate the potential of 
      attention-based architectures and specific preprocessing strategies to improve 
      segmentation quality in such a challenging clinical scenario, while emphasizing 
      the importance of uncertainty estimation to build trustworthy AI systems in 
      medical imaging. Code is available at:

AB  - Feature selection in Knowledge Graphs (KGs) is increasingly utilized in diverse 
      domains, including biomedical research, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and 
      personalized recommendation systems. This paper delves into the methodologies for 
      feature selection (FS) within KGs, emphasizing their roles in enhancing machine 
      learning (ML) model efficacy, hypothesis generation, and interpretability. 
      Through this comprehensive review, we aim to catalyze further innovation in FS 
      for KGs, paving the way for more insightful, efficient, and interpretable 
      analytical models across various domains. Our exploration reveals the critical 
      importance of scalability, accuracy, and interpretability in FS techniques, 
      advocating for the integration of domain knowledge to refine the selection 
      process. We highlight the burgeoning potential of multi-objective optimization 
      and interdisciplinary collaboration in advancing KG FS, underscoring the 
      transformative impact of such methodologies on precision medicine, among other 
      fields. The paper concludes by charting future directions, including the 
      development of scalable, dynamic FS algorithms and the integration of explainable 
      AI principles to foster transparency and trust in KG-driven models.

TI  - A Review on Biomarker-Enhanced Machine Learning for Early Diagnosis and Outcome 
      Prediction in Ovarian Cancer Management.
PG  - e71224
LID - 10.1002/cam4.71224 [doi]
LID - e71224
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer (OC) remains the most lethal gynecological malignancy, 
      largely due to its late-stage diagnosis and nonspecific early symptoms. Advances 
      in biomarker identification and machine learning offer promising avenues for 
      improving early detection and prognosis. This review evaluates the role of 
      biomarker-driven ML models in enhancing the early detection, risk stratification, 
      and treatment planning of OC. METHODS: We analyzed literature spanning clinical, 
      biomarker, and ML studies, emphasizing key diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers 
      (e.g., CA-125, HE4) and ML techniques (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural 
      Networks). The review synthesizes findings from 17 investigations that integrate 
      multi-modal data, including tumor markers, inflammatory, metabolic, and 
      hematologic parameters, to assess ML model performance. FINDINGS: 
      Biomarker-driven ML models significantly outperform traditional statistical 
      methods, achieving AUC values exceeding 0.90 in diagnosing OC and distinguishing 
      malignant from benign tumors. Ensemble methods (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) and 
      deep learning approaches (e.g., RNNs) excel in classification accuracy (up to 
      99.82%), survival prediction (AUC up to 0.866), and treatment response 
      forecasting. Combining CA-125 and HE4 with additional markers like CRP and NLR 
      enhances specificity and sensitivity. However, limitations such as small sample 
      sizes, lack of external validation, and exclusion of imaging/genomic data hinder 
      clinical adoption. CONCLUSION: Biomarker-driven ML represents a transformative 
      approach for OC management, improving diagnostic precision and personalized care. 
      Future research should prioritize multi-center validation, multi-omics 
      integration, and explainable AI to overcome current challenges and enable 
      real-world implementation, potentially reducing OC mortality through earlier 
      detection and optimized treatment.

TI  - Diagnosis of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis in High-Resolution Computed Tomography 
      Scans Using a Combination of Handcrafted Radiomics and Deep Learning.
PG  - 915243
LID - 10.3389/fmed.2022.915243 [doi]
LID - 915243
AB  - PURPOSE: To develop handcrafted radiomics (HCR) and deep learning (DL) based 
      automated diagnostic tools that can differentiate between idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis (IPF) and non-IPF interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) in patients using 
      high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scans. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this 
      retrospective study, 474 HRCT scans were included (mean age, 64.10 years ± 9.57 
      [SD]). Five-fold cross-validation was performed on 365 HRCT scans. Furthermore, 
      an external dataset comprising 109 patients was used as a test set. An HCR model, 
      a DL model, and an ensemble of HCR and DL model were developed. A virtual 
      in-silico trial was conducted with two radiologists and one pulmonologist on the 
      same external test set for performance comparison. The performance was compared 
      using DeLong method and McNemar test. Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) plots 
      and Grad-CAM heatmaps were used for the post-hoc interpretability of HCR and DL 
      models, respectively. RESULTS: In five-fold cross-validation, the HCR model, DL 
      model, and the ensemble of HCR and DL models achieved accuracies of 76.2 ± 6.8, 
      77.9 ± 4.6, and 85.2 ± 2.7%, respectively. For the diagnosis of IPF and non-IPF 
      ILDs on the external test set, the HCR, DL, and the ensemble of HCR and DL models 
      achieved accuracies of 76.1, 77.9, and 85.3%, respectively. The ensemble model 
      outperformed the diagnostic performance of clinicians who achieved a mean 
      accuracy of 66.3 ± 6.7% (p < 0.05) during the in-silico trial. The area under the 
      receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the ensemble model on the test 
      set was 0.917 which was significantly higher than the HCR model (0.817, p = 0.02) 
      and the DL model (0.823, p = 0.005). The agreement between HCR and DL models was 
      61.4%, and the accuracy and specificity for the predictions when both the models 
      agree were 93 and 97%, respectively. SHAP analysis showed the texture features as 
      the most important features for IPF diagnosis and Grad-CAM showed that the model 
      focused on the clinically relevant part of the image. CONCLUSION: Deep learning 
      and HCR models can complement each other and serve as useful clinical aids for 
      the diagnosis of IPF and non-IPF ILDs.

TI  - Exploring Gender Bias in AI for Personalized Medicine: Focus Group Study With 
      Trans Community Members.
PG  - e72325
LID - 10.2196/72325 [doi]
LID - e72325
AB  - BACKGROUND: This paper explores the perception and application of artificial 
      intelligence (AI) for personalized medicine within the trans community, an 
      often-overlooked demographic in the broader scope of precision medicine. Despite 
      growing advancements in AI-driven health care solutions, little research has been 
      dedicated to understanding how these technologies can be tailored to meet the 
      unique health care needs of trans individuals. Addressing this gap is crucial for 
      ensuring that precision medicine is genuinely inclusive and effective for all 
      populations. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify the specific challenges, 
      obstacles, and potential solutions associated with the deployment of AI 
      technologies in the development of personalized medicine for trans people. This 
      research emphasizes a trans-inclusive and multidisciplinary perspective, 
      highlighting the importance of cultural competence and community engagement in 
      the design and implementation of AI-driven health care solutions. METHODS: A 
      communicative methodology was applied in this study, prioritizing the active 
      involvement of end-users and stakeholders through egalitarian dialogue that 
      recognizes and values cultural intelligence. The methodological design included 
      iterative consultations with trans community representatives to cocreate the 
      research workflow and adapt data collection instruments accordingly. This 
      participatory approach ensured that the perspectives and lived experiences of 
      trans individuals were integral to the research process. Data collection was 
      conducted through 3 focus groups with 16 trans adults, aimed at discussing the 
      challenges, risks, and transformative potential of AI in precision medicine. 
      RESULTS: Analysis of the focus group discussions revealed several critical 
      barriers impacting the integration of AI in personalized medicine for trans 
      people, including concerns around data privacy, biases in algorithmic 
      decision-making, and the lack of tailored health care data reflective of trans 
      experiences. Participants expressed apprehensions about potential misdiagnoses or 
      inappropriate treatments due to cisnormative data models. However, they also 
      identified opportunities for AI to enhance health care outcomes, advocating for 
      community-led data collection initiatives and improved algorithmic transparency. 
      Proposed solutions included enhancing datasets with trans-specific health 
      markers, incorporating community voices in AI development processes, and 
      prioritizing ethical frameworks that respect gender diversity. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      study underscores the necessity for a trans-inclusive approach to precision 
      medicine, facilitated by AI technologies that are sensitive to the health care 
      needs and lived realities of trans people. By addressing the identified 
      challenges and adopting community-driven solutions, AI has the potential to 
      bridge existing health care gaps and improve the quality of life for trans 
      individuals. This research contributes to the growing discourse on equitable 
      health care innovation, calling for more inclusive AI design practices that 
      extend the benefits of precision medicine to marginalized communities.

AB  - Gene expression regulation underpins cellular function and disease progression, 
      yet its complexity and the limitations of conventional detection methods hinder 
      clinical translation. In this review, we define "predict" as the AI-driven 
      inference of gene expression levels and regulatory mechanisms from non-invasive 
      multimodal data (e.g., histopathology images, genomic sequences, and electronic 
      health records) instead of direct molecular assays. We systematically examine and 
      analyze the current approaches for predicting gene expression and diagnosing 
      diseases, highlighting their respective advantages and limitations. Machine 
      learning algorithms and deep learning models excel in extracting meaningful 
      features from diverse biomedical modalities, enabling tools like PathChat and 
      Prov-GigaPath to improve cancer subtyping, therapy response prediction, and 
      biomarker discovery. Despite significant progress, persistent challenges-such as 
      data heterogeneity, noise, and ethical issues including privacy and algorithmic 
      bias-still limit broad clinical adoption. Emerging solutions like cross-modal 
      pretraining frameworks, federated learning, and fairness-aware model design aim 
      to overcome these barriers. Case studies in precision oncology illustrate AI's 
      ability to decode tumor ecosystems and predict treatment outcomes. By harmonizing 
      multimodal data and advancing ethical AI practices, this field holds immense 
      potential to propel personalized medicine forward, although further innovation is 
      needed to address the issues of scalability, interpretability, and equitable 
      deployment.

AB  - The aim of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is to design intelligent 
      systems that can explain their predictions or recommendations to humans. Such 
      systems are particularly desirable for therapeutic decision support, because 
      physicians need to understand rcommendations to have confidence in their 
      application and to adapt them if required, e.g. in case of patient 
      contraindication. We propose here an explainable and visual approach for decision 
      support in antibiotic treatment, based on an ontology. There were three steps to 
      our method. We first generated a tabular dataset from the ontology, containing 
      features defined on various domains and n-ary features. A preference model was 
      then learned from patient profiles, antibiotic features and expert 
      recommendations found in clinical practice guidelines. This model made the 
      implicit rationale of the expert explicit, including the way in which missing 
      data was treated. We then visualized the preference model and its application to 
      all antibiotics available on the market for a given clinical situation, using 
      rainbow boxes, a recently developed technique for set visualization. The 
      resulting preference model had an error rate of 3.5% on the learning data, and 
      5.2% on test data (10-fold validation). These findings suggest that our system 
      can help physicians to prescribe antibiotics correctly, even for clinical 
      situations not present in the guidelines (e.g. due to allergies or 
      contraindications for the recommended treatment).

AB  - Early disease detection and prevention methods based on effective interventions 
      are gaining attention worldwide. Progress in precision medicine has revealed that 
      substantial heterogeneity exists in health data at the individual level and that 
      complex health factors are involved in chronic disease development. 
      Machine-learning techniques have enabled precise personal-level disease 
      prediction by capturing individual differences in multivariate data. However, it 
      is challenging to identify what aspects should be improved for disease prevention 
      based on future disease-onset prediction because of the complex relationships 
      among multiple biomarkers. Here, we present a health-disease phase diagram (HDPD) 
      that represents an individual's health state by visualizing the future-onset 
      boundary values of multiple biomarkers that fluctuate early in the disease 
      progression process. In HDPDs, future-onset predictions are represented by 
      perturbing multiple biomarker values while accounting for dependencies among 
      variables. We constructed HDPDs for 11 diseases using longitudinal health checkup 
      cohort data of 3,238 individuals, comprising 3,215 measurement items and genetic 
      data. The improvement of biomarker values to the non-onset region in HDPD 
      remarkably prevented future disease onset in 7 out of 11 diseases. HDPDs can 
      represent individual physiological states in the onset process and be used as 
      intervention goals for disease prevention.

AB  - Understanding complex disease mechanisms requires a comprehensive understanding 
      of the gene regulatory networks, as complex diseases are often characterized by 
      the dysregulation and dysfunction of molecular networks, rather than 
      abnormalities in single genes. Specifically, the exploration of cell 
      line-specific gene networks can provide essential clues for precision medicine, 
      as this methodology can uncover molecular interplays specific to particular cell 
      line statuses, such as drug sensitivity, cancer progression, etc. In this 
      article, we provide a comprehensive review of computational strategies for cell 
      line-specific gene network analysis: (1) cell line-specific gene regulatory 
      network estimation and analysis of gene networks under varying 
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) statuses of cell lines; and (2) an 
      explainable artificial intelligence approach for interpreting the estimated 
      massive multiple EMT-status-specific gene networks. The objective of this review 
      is to help readers grasp the concept of computational network biology, which 
      holds significant implications for precision medicine by offering crucial clues.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence in the Diagnostic Use of Transcranial Doppler and 
      Sonography: A Scoping Review of Current Applications and Future Directions.
LID - 10.3390/bioengineering12070681 [doi]
LID - 681
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the field of medical imaging, 
      offering unprecedented capabilities in data analysis, image interpretation, and 
      decision support. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) and Transcranial Color-Coded Doppler 
      (TCCD) are widely used, non-invasive modalities for evaluating cerebral 
      hemodynamics in acute and chronic conditions. Yet, their reliance on operator 
      expertise and subjective interpretation limits their full potential. AI, 
      particularly machine learning and deep learning algorithms, has emerged as a 
      transformative tool to address these challenges by automating image acquisition, 
      optimizing signal quality, and enhancing diagnostic accuracy. Key applications 
      reviewed include the automated identification of cerebrovascular abnormalities 
      such as vasospasm and embolus detection in TCD, AI-guided workflow optimization, 
      and real-time feedback in general ultrasound imaging. Despite promising advances, 
      significant challenges remain, including data standardization, algorithm 
      interpretability, and the integration of these tools into clinical practice. 
      Developing robust, generalizable AI models and integrating multimodal imaging 
      data promise to enhance diagnostic and prognostic capabilities in TCD and 
      ultrasound. By bridging the gap between technological innovation and clinical 
      utility, AI has the potential to reshape the landscape of neurovascular and 
      diagnostic imaging, driving advancements in personalized medicine and improving 
      patient outcomes. This review highlights the critical role of interdisciplinary 
      collaboration in achieving these goals, exploring the current applications and 
      future directions of AI in TCD and TCCD imaging. This review included 41 studies 
      on the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in neurosonology in the 
      diagnosis and monitoring of vascular and parenchymal brain pathologies. Machine 
      learning, deep learning, and convolutional neural network algorithms have been 
      effectively utilized in the analysis of TCD and TCCD data for several conditions. 
      Conversely, the application of artificial intelligence techniques in transcranial 
      sonography for the assessment of parenchymal brain disorders, such as dementia 
      and space-occupying lesions, remains largely unexplored. Nonetheless, this area 
      holds significant potential for future research and clinical innovation.

TI  - Explainable Precision Medicine in Breast MRI: A Combined Radiomics and Deep 
      Learning Approach for the Classification of Contrast Agent Uptake.
LID - 10.3390/bioengineering11060556 [doi]
LID - 556
AB  - In DCE-MRI, the degree of contrast uptake in normal fibroglandular tissue, i.e., 
      background parenchymal enhancement (BPE), is a crucial biomarker linked to breast 
      cancer risk and treatment outcome. In accordance with the Breast Imaging 
      Reporting & Data System (BI-RADS), it should be visually classified into four 
      classes. The susceptibility of such an assessment to inter-reader variability 
      highlights the urgent need for a standardized classification algorithm. In this 
      retrospective study, the first post-contrast subtraction images for 27 healthy 
      female subjects were included. The BPE was classified slice-wise by two expert 
      radiologists. The extraction of radiomic features from segmented BPE was followed 
      by dataset splitting and dimensionality reduction. The latent representations 
      were then utilized as inputs to a deep neural network classifying BPE into 
      BI-RADS classes. The network's predictions were elucidated at the radiomic 
      feature level with Shapley values. The deep neural network achieved a BPE 
      classification accuracy of 84 ± 2% (p-value < 0.00001). Most of the 
      misclassifications involved adjacent classes. Different radiomic features were 
      decisive for the prediction of each BPE class underlying the complexity of the 
      decision boundaries. A highly precise and explainable pipeline for BPE 
      classification was achieved without user- or algorithm-dependent radiomic feature 
      selection.

PG  - e14559
LID - 10.1002/acm2.14559 [doi]
LID - e14559
AB  - The integration of machine learning (ML) with radiotherapy has emerged as a 
      pivotal innovation in outcome prediction, bringing novel insights amid unique 
      challenges. This review comprehensively examines the current scope of ML 
      applications in various treatment contexts, focusing on treatment outcomes such 
      as patient survival, disease recurrence, and treatment-induced toxicity. It 
      emphasizes the ascending trajectory of research efforts and the prominence of 
      survival analysis as a clinical priority. We analyze the use of several common 
      medical imaging modalities in conjunction with clinical data, highlighting the 
      advantages and complexities inherent in this approach. The research reflects a 
      commitment to advancing patient-centered care, advocating for expanded research 
      on abdominal and pancreatic cancers. While data collection, patient privacy, 
      standardization, and interpretability present significant challenges, leveraging 
      ML in radiotherapy holds remarkable promise for elevating precision medicine and 
      improving patient care outcomes.

AB  - Hematological malignancy is a highly heterogeneous disease with complex 
      biological characteristics and diverse clinical manifestations. Therefore, 
      precise diagnosis and treatment are crucial and urgently needed. To further 
      improve the accuracy of diagnosis and prognostication and to promote personalized 
      therapy, artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly used. This study 
      reviewed literature published in the last 5 years and summarized the application, 
      benefits, and drawbacks of AI in the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of 
      hematologic malignancies. Although AI can effectively improve the accuracy of 
      diagnosis and therapy, low-quality data, poor interpretability of the model, and 
      limited clinical transformation have impeded its popularization and application. 
      In the future, the clinical application of AI in hematologic malignancy can be 
      accelerated by establishing standards for clinical data processing, integrating 
      multimodal information for accurate diagnosis and prognostication, and conducting 
      systematic clinical verification of model algorithms.

AB  - Vast quantities of Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) are routinely acquired in 
      clinical practice but, to speed up acquisition, these scans are typically of a 
      quality that is sufficient for clinical diagnosis but sub-optimal for large-scale 
      precision medicine, computational diagnostics, and large-scale neuroimaging 
      collaborative research. Here, we present a critic-guided framework to upsample 
      low-resolution (often 2D) MRI full scans to help overcome these limitations. We 
      incorporate feature-importance and self-attention methods into our model to 
      improve the interpretability of this study. We evaluate our framework on paired 
      low- and high-resolution brain MRI structural full scans (i.e., T1-, T2-weighted, 
      and FLAIR sequences are simultaneously input) obtained in clinical and research 
      settings from scanners manufactured by Siemens, Phillips, and GE. We show that 
      the upsampled MRIs are qualitatively faithful to the ground-truth high-quality 
      scans (PSNR = 35.39; MAE = 3.78E-3; NMSE = 4.32E-10; SSIM = 0.9852; mean 
      normal-appearing gray/white matter ratio intensity differences ranging from 
      0.0363 to 0.0784 for FLAIR, from 0.0010 to 0.0138 for T1-weighted and from 0.0156 
      to 0.074 for T2-weighted sequences). The automatic raw segmentation of tissues 
      and lesions using the super-resolved images has fewer false positives and higher 
      accuracy than those obtained from interpolated images in protocols represented 
      with more than three sets in the training sample, making our approach a strong 
      candidate for practical application in clinical and collaborative research.

AB  - AIMS: Current risk prediction models, such as the Norwegian NORRISK 2, explain 
      only a modest proportion of cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence. This study 
      aimed to develop improved sex-specific models for predicting the 10-year CVD risk 
      as well as sex- and age-specific thresholds for intervention. METHODS: Data from 
      31,946 participants (40-79 years) without prior CVD were analyzed. Data were 
      randomly split into a training set (for estimation) and a test set (for model 
      evaluation). An extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model was used to identify 
      the most important predictive variables. Next, prediction models were developed 
      on the training set for each sex separately using XGBoost and logistic 
      regression. The models were evaluated on the test set using receiver-operating 
      characteristic (ROC) and precision recall (PR) curves. Finally, age- and 
      sex-specific thresholds for intervention were explored. RESULTS: All traditional 
      risk factors included in NORRISK 2 and the European SCORE2 model were important 
      predictors for males, but not for females. Potential new risk predictors were 
      identified. The XGBoost model improved CVD risk prediction for males: 0.013- and 
      0.012-unit increase in ROC-AUC compared to NORRISK 2 and SCORE2 respectively, and 
      12% and 11% increase in PR-AUC respectively. For females, neither the XGBoost nor 
      logistic regression model performed significantly better than NORRISK 2 and 
      SCORE2. Age- and sex-specific thresholds showed an improvement in sensitivity 
      compared with NORRISK 2-suggested thresholds. CONCLUSIONS: By employing 
      statistical learning and incorporating sex-specific risk factors, we propose 
      improved risk prediction models for CVD in males. Introducing sex-specific 
      thresholds for intervention could enhance CVD prevention for both sexes.

OAB - The study showed how artificial intelligence can improve the tools to predict the 
      chances of a person experiencing heart disease within 10 years: In addition to 
      traditional factors that can increase the risk for heart disease, such as age, 
      high blood pressure, smoking, we identified new characteristics separately for 
      men and for women. Being aware of these factors and making lifestyle changes 
      accordingly could mean remaining in good heart health for longer time.We 
      developed new prediction tools separately for men and women, that is, using 
      different risk factors for each sex and different thresholds that suggest when a 
      person is at risk. These new tools make the prediction of having heart disease 
      more precise. Increased precision is very important for doctors to identify 
      persons at risk also when they look apparently healthy, and at same time avoid 
      overtreating healthy persons.

AB  - BACKGROUND: With the rapid advancement of genomic sequencing techniques, massive 
      production of gene expression data is becoming possible, which prompts the 
      development of precision medicine. Deep learning is a promising approach for 
      phenotype prediction (clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response) based on 
      gene expression profile. Existing deep learning models are usually considered as 
      black-boxes that provide accurate predictions but are not interpretable. However, 
      accuracy and interpretation are both essential for precision medicine. In 
      addition, most models do not integrate the knowledge of the domain. Hence, making 
      deep learning models interpretable for medical applications using prior 
      biological knowledge is the main focus of this paper. RESULTS: In this paper, we 
      propose a new self-explainable deep learning model, called Deep GONet, 
      integrating the Gene Ontology into the hierarchical architecture of the neural 
      network. This model is based on a fully-connected architecture constrained by the 
      Gene Ontology annotations, such that each neuron represents a biological 
      function. The experiments on cancer diagnosis datasets demonstrate that Deep 
      GONet is both easily interpretable and highly performant to discriminate cancer 
      and non-cancer samples. CONCLUSIONS: Our model provides an explanation to its 
      predictions by identifying the most important neurons and associating them with 
      biological functions, making the model understandable for biologists and 
      physicians.

AB  - Background and Objective: Corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL) is a treatment 
      which arrests keratoconus (KC) progression, but its effectiveness differs 
      radically among patients. Herein, we report preoperative diagnostic findings that 
      reflect CXL outcomes and allow physicians to prognosticate treatment efficiency. 
      Methods: In a medical centre, we retrospectively analysed pre- and postoperative 
      data about 107 patients (112 eyes) treated with CXL from January 2018 to December 
      2022. Exclusion criteria were age below 16 years, a corneal thickness below 400 
      microns, severe dry eye, other corneal diseases/infections, re-CXL, pregnancy and 
      missing follow-up examinations. All the subjects (79 males and 28 females) were 
      followed for a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 40 months. The study dataset was 
      comprised of 796 cases of clinical assessment, pachymetry, visiometry, 
      refractometry and topography examinations. With these data, we modelled maximum 
      anterior keratometry (K (max)) and curvature power of the flat and steep 
      meridians of the corneal anterior surface (K (1) and K (2)). Results: Two years 
      after the invasion, corneal curvature coefficients decreased progressively. Then, 
      they remained stable for four months and rose afterwards. In the most accurate K 
      (1), K (2) and K (max) models, the proportion of mean absolute error to the range 
      of values was 1.72, 3.66 and 2.37%, respectively. Pronounced corneal thinning, 
      low best-corrected visual acuity and high K (max) levels predict unfavourable 
      outcomes. Conclusions: The high accuracy of the models advocates for a 
      personalised approach to candidate selection for CXL.

TI  - High-resolution transcription factor binding sites prediction improved 
      performance and interpretability by deep learning method.
LID - bbab273 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/bib/bbab273 [doi]
AB  - Transcription factors (TFs) are essential proteins in regulating the 
      spatiotemporal expression of genes. It is crucial to infer the potential 
      transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) with high resolution to promote 
      biology and realize precision medicine. Recently, deep learning-based models have 
      shown exemplary performance in the prediction of TFBSs at the base-pair level. 
      However, the previous models fail to integrate nucleotide position information 
      and semantic information without noisy responses. Thus, there is still room for 
      improvement. Moreover, both the inner mechanism and prediction results of these 
      models are challenging to interpret. To this end, the Deep Attentive 
      Encoder-Decoder Neural Network (D-AEDNet) is developed to identify the location 
      of TFs-DNA binding sites in DNA sequences. In particular, our model adopts Skip 
      Architecture to leverage the nucleotide position information in the encoder and 
      removes noisy responses in the information fusion process by Attention Gate. 
      Simultaneously, the Transcription Factor Motif Discovery based on Sliding Window 
      (TF-MoDSW), an approach to discover TFs-DNA binding motifs by utilizing the 
      output of neural networks, is proposed to understand the biological meaning of 
      the predicted result. On ChIP-exo datasets, experimental results show that 
      D-AEDNet has better performance than competing methods. Besides, we authenticate 
      that Attention Gate can improve the interpretability of our model by ways of 
      visualization analysis. Furthermore, we confirm that ability of D-AEDNet to learn 
      TFs-DNA binding motifs outperform the state-of-the-art methods and availability 
      of TF-MoDSW to discover biological sequence motifs in TFs-DNA interaction by 
      conducting experiment on ChIP-seq datasets.

AB  - The mapping of genotypes to phenotypes is a cornerstone of genetics, critical for 
      understanding disease mechanisms and advancing precision medicine. The advent of 
      next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has enabled the generation of 
      extensive genomic datasets, yet the complexity and scale of these data demand 
      innovative analytical approaches. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a 
      transformative tool, integrating genotype and phenotype data, uncovering 
      intricate patterns, and driving advancements in diagnosis, therapy, and 
      research.AI applications in phenotype-genotype mapping span various machine 
      learning and deep learning techniques. Supervised learning methods, such as 
      Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting, predict 
      variant pathogenicity and classify genetic risks by leveraging curated datasets. 
      Unsupervised approaches, including k-Means clustering and hierarchical 
      clustering, uncover hidden patterns in data, enabling the identification of 
      disease subtypes and novel associations. Dimensionality reduction techniques like 
      Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor 
      Embedding (t-SNE) simplify high-dimensional genomic data for analysis and 
      visualization. Neural networks, including Convolutional and Recurrent Neural 
      Networks (CNNs and RNNs), excel at extracting insights from complex datasets like 
      gene expression profiles and genomic sequences. These methodologies have found 
      applications in rare disease diagnosis, drug discovery, and risk assessment for 
      complex diseases. AI tools integrate genetic and phenotypic data to prioritize 
      pathogenic variants, significantly improving diagnostic yields for unresolved 
      cases. Multi-omic data integration, incorporating genomics, transcriptomics, and 
      proteomics, offers a holistic perspective on genotype-phenotype relationships. In 
      drug discovery, AI identifies therapeutic targets and predicts drug efficacy, 
      accelerating the development of precision treatments.Despite its potential, 
      challenges persist. Data heterogeneity, limited interpretability of AI models, 
      privacy concerns, and insufficient datasets for rare diseases impede broader 
      implementation. To address these issues, AI frameworks incorporate data 
      standardization, explainability techniques like SHAP and LIME, federated learning 
      for secure collaborative research, and data augmentation methods such as transfer 
      learning and GANs. Future directions include the integration of multi-omic data, 
      advanced explainable AI for clinical adoption, and the expansion of federated 
      learning to facilitate cross-institutional collaborations. By bridging the gap 
      between genotype and phenotype, AI-driven methodologies are transforming clinical 
      genomics and personalized medicine. This chapter explores the methodologies, 
      applications, challenges, and future prospects of AI in phenotype-genotype 
      mapping, highlighting its pivotal role in advancing genetic research and 
      improving healthcare outcomes.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence Approaches for Early Prediction of Parkinson's Disease.
LID - 10.2174/0118715249377789250724111141 [doi]
AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects 
      both motor and non-motor functions, primarily due to the gradual loss of 
      dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Traditional diagnostic methods 
      largely depend on clinical symptom evaluation, which often leads to delays in 
      detection and treatment. However, in recent years, artificial intelligence (AI), 
      particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), have emerged as 
      groundbreaking techniques for the diagnosis and management of PD. This review 
      explores the emergent role of AI-driven techniques in early disease detection, 
      continuous monitoring, and the development of personalized treatment strategies. 
      Advanced AI applications, including medical imaging analysis, speech pattern 
      recognition, gait assessment, and the identification of digital biomarkers, have 
      shown remarkable potential in improving diagnostic accuracy and patient care. 
      Additionally, AI-driven telemedicine solutions enable remote and real-time 
      disease monitoring, addressing challenges related to accessibility and early 
      intervention. Despite these promising advancements, several hurdles remain, such 
      as concerns over data privacy, the interpretability of AI models, and the need 
      for rigorous validation before clinical implementation. With PD cases expected to 
      rise significantly by 2030, further research and interdisciplinary collaboration 
      are crucial to refining AI technologies and ensuring their reliability in medical 
      practice. By bridging the gap between technology and neurology, AI has the 
      potential to revolutionize PD management, paving the way for precision medicine 
      and better patient outcomes.

TI  - The dawn of a new era: can machine learning and large language models reshape QSP 
      modeling?
PG  - 36

AB  - Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) has emerged as a cornerstone of modern 
      drug development, providing a robust framework to integrate data from preclinical 
      and clinical studies, enhance decision-making, and optimize therapeutic 
      strategies. By modeling biological systems and drug interactions, QSP enables 
      predictions of outcomes, optimization of dosing regimens, and personalized 
      medicine applications. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and 
      machine learning (ML) hold the potential to significantly transform QSP by 
      enabling enhanced data extraction, fostering the development of hybrid 
      mechanistic ML models, and supporting the introduction of surrogate models and 
      digital twins. This manuscript explores the transformative role of AI and ML in 
      reshaping QSP modeling workflows. AI/ML tools now enable automated literature 
      mining, the generation of dynamic models from data, and the creation of hybrid 
      frameworks that blend mechanistic insights with data-driven approaches. Large 
      Language Models (LLMs) further revolutionize the field by transitioning AI/ML 
      from merely a tool to becoming an active partner in QSP modeling. By facilitating 
      interdisciplinary collaboration, lowering barriers to entry, and democratizing 
      QSP workflows, LLMs empower researchers without deep coding expertise to engage 
      in complex modeling tasks. Additionally, the integration of Artificial General 
      Intelligence (AGI) holds the potential to autonomously propose, refine, and 
      validate models, further accelerating innovation across multiscale biological 
      processes. Key challenges remain in integrating AI/ML into QSP workflows, 
      particularly in ensuring rigorous validation pipelines, addressing ethical 
      considerations, and establishing robust regulatory frameworks to address the 
      reliability and reproducibility of AI-assisted models. Moreover, the complexity 
      of multiscale biological integration, effective data management, and fostering 
      interdisciplinary collaboration present ongoing hurdles. Despite these 
      challenges, the potential of AI/ML to enhance hybrid model development, improve 
      model interpretability, and democratize QSP modeling offers an exciting 
      opportunity to revolutionize drug development and therapeutic innovation. This 
      work highlights a pathway toward a transformative era for QSP, leveraging 
      advancements in AI and ML to address these challenges and drive innovation in the 
      field.

AB  - This study presents a novel clinical decision support platform for 
      orthodontic-orthognathic treatment that integrates multi-task reinforcement 
      learning with explainable artificial intelligence. The platform addresses the 
      challenges of personalized treatment planning in complex dentofacial deformities 
      by formulating treatment as a sequential decision-making process optimizing 
      multiple clinical objectives simultaneously. We developed a comprehensive 
      framework comprising: (1) a multi-task reinforcement learning core with 
      specialized state-action representations for craniofacial structures; (2) 
      complementary explainable AI components that render complex model decisions 
      interpretable within clinical contexts; and (3) an interactive interface 
      facilitating collaborative human-AI decision-making. Experimental validation with 
      347 retrospectively analyzed cases demonstrated significant improvements in 
      treatment plan quality (19.9%), decision efficiency (73.9% time reduction), and 
      prediction accuracy (92.7%) compared to conventional methods. Clinical evaluation 
      by multidisciplinary specialists confirmed the system's practical utility, with 
      particularly strong performance in complex cases featuring multiple dentofacial 
      abnormalities. The proposed platform represents a significant advancement toward 
      evidence-driven, personalized treatment planning in orthodontic-orthognathic 
      therapy while maintaining clinical interpretability and expert oversight.

TI  - Bimodal Gene Expression in Patients with Cancer Provides Interpretable Biomarkers 
      for Drug Sensitivity.
PG  - 2378-2387
LID - 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-21-2395 [doi]
AB  - Identifying biomarkers predictive of cancer cell response to drug treatment 
      constitutes one of the main challenges in precision oncology. Recent large-scale 
      cancer pharmacogenomic studies have opened new avenues of research to develop 
      predictive biomarkers by profiling thousands of human cancer cell lines at the 
      molecular level and screening them with hundreds of approved drugs and 
      experimental chemical compounds. Many studies have leveraged these data to build 
      predictive models of response using various statistical and machine learning 
      methods. However, a common pitfall to these methods is the lack of 
      interpretability as to how they make predictions, hindering the clinical 
      translation of these models. To alleviate this issue, we used the recent logic 
      modeling approach to develop a new machine learning pipeline that explores the 
      space of bimodally expressed genes in multiple large in vitro pharmacogenomic 
      studies and builds multivariate, nonlinear, yet interpretable logic-based models 
      predictive of drug response. The performance of this approach was showcased in a 
      compendium of the three largest in vitro pharmacogenomic datasets to build robust 
      and interpretable models for 101 drugs that span 17 drug classes with high 
      validation rates in independent datasets. These results along with in vivo and 
      clinical validation support a better translation of gene expression biomarkers 
      between model systems using bimodal gene expression. SIGNIFICANCE: A new machine 
      learning pipeline exploits the bimodality of gene expression to provide a 
      reliable set of candidate predictive biomarkers with a high potential for 
      clinical translatability.

PG  - zcaf029

AB  - Personalized treatment selection is crucial for cancer patients due to the high 
      variability in drug response. While actionable mutations can increasingly inform 
      treatment decisions, most therapies still rely on population-based approaches. 
      Here, we introduce neural interaction explainable AI (NeurixAI), an explainable 
      and highly scalable deep learning framework that models drug-gene interactions 
      and identifies transcriptomic patterns linked with drug response. Trained on data 
      from 546 646 drug perturbation experiments involving 1135 drugs and molecular 
      profiles from 476 tumors, NeurixAI accurately predicted treatment responses for 
      272 targeted and 30 chemotherapeutic drugs in unseen tumor samples (Spearman's 
      rho >0.2), maintaining high performance on an external validation set. 
      Additionally, NeurixAI identified the anticancer potential of 160 repurposed 
      non-cancer drugs. Using explainable artificial intelligence (xAI), our framework 
      uncovered key genes influencing drug response at the individual tumor level and 
      revealed both known and novel mechanisms of drug resistance. These findings 
      demonstrate the potential of integrating transcriptomics with xAI to optimize 
      cancer treatment, enable drug repurposing, and identify new therapeutic targets.

TI  - Integrating Model-Informed Drug Development With AI: A Synergistic Approach to 
      Accelerating Pharmaceutical Innovation.
PG  - e70124
LID - 10.1111/cts.70124 [doi]
LID - e70124
AB  - The pharmaceutical industry constantly strives to improve drug development 
      processes to reduce costs, increase efficiencies, and enhance therapeutic 
      outcomes for patients. Model-Informed Drug Development (MIDD) uses mathematical 
      models to simulate intricate processes involved in drug absorption, distribution, 
      metabolism, and excretion, as well as pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. 
      Artificial intelligence (AI), encompassing techniques such as machine learning, 
      deep learning, and Generative AI, offers powerful tools and algorithms to 
      efficiently identify meaningful patterns, correlations, and drug-target 
      interactions from big data, enabling more accurate predictions and novel 
      hypothesis generation. The union of MIDD with AI enables pharmaceutical 
      researchers to optimize drug candidate selection, dosage regimens, and treatment 
      strategies through virtual trials to help derisk drug candidates. However, 
      several challenges, including the availability of relevant, labeled, high-quality 
      datasets, data privacy concerns, model interpretability, and algorithmic bias, 
      must be carefully managed. Standardization of model architectures, data formats, 
      and validation processes is imperative to ensure reliable and reproducible 
      results. Moreover, regulatory agencies have recognized the need to adapt their 
      guidelines to evaluate recommendations from AI-enhanced MIDD methods. In 
      conclusion, integrating model-driven drug development with AI offers a 
      transformative paradigm for pharmaceutical innovation. By integrating the 
      predictive power of computational models and the data-driven insights of AI, the 
      synergy between these approaches has the potential to accelerate drug discovery, 
      optimize treatment strategies, and usher in a new era of personalized medicine, 
      benefiting patients, researchers, and the pharmaceutical industry as a whole.

AB  - The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with conventional biostatistics 
      represents a pivotal advancement in healthcare research. The synergistic 
      relationship between traditional biostatistical approaches and modern AI 
      techniques highlights their complementary roles in advancing medical research and 
      clinical practice. While conventional biostatistics provides robust frameworks 
      for hypothesis testing, parameter estimation, and statistical inference, AI 
      offers enhanced capabilities in pattern recognition, predictive modeling, and the 
      analysis of complex, high-dimensional datasets. This chapter explores the 
      fundamental concepts and the complementary strengths of these two paradigms, 
      discussing their foundational principles, practical applications, critical 
      challenges, and ethical considerations in clinical practice. Furthermore, we 
      present emerging trends and future directions, focusing on explainable AI, hybrid 
      modeling approaches, real-time data integration, and advances in precision 
      medicine. The comprehensive analysis illuminates the convergence of AI and 
      biostatistics is revolutionizing healthcare research while maintaining scientific 
      rigor and statistical validity, ultimately paving the way for more sophisticated, 
      efficient, and personalized healthcare solutions.

TI  - Using simulation and optimization approach to improve outcome through warfarin

PG  - 412-423
LID - 29218901 [doi]
AB  - We apply a treatment simulation and optimization approach to develop decision 
      support guidance for warfarin precision treatment plans. Simulation include the 
      use of ∼1,500,000 clinical avatars (simulated patients) generated by an 
      integrated data-driven and domain-knowledge based Bayesian Network Modeling 
      approach. Subsequently, we simulate 30-day individual patient response to 
      warfarin treatment of five clinical and genetic treatment plans followed by both 
      individual and subpopulation based optimization. Sub-population optimization 
      (compared to individual optimization) provides a cost effective and realistic 
      means of implementation of a precision-driven treatment plan in practical 
      settings. In this project, we use the property of minimal entropy to minimize 
      overall adverse risks for the largest possible patient sub-populations and we 
      temper the results by considering both transparency and ease of implementation. 
      Finally, we discuss the improved outcome of the precision treatment plan based on 
      the sub-population optimized decision support rules.

AB  - One drug's pharmacological activity may be changed unexpectedly, owing to the 
      concurrent administration of another drug. It is likely to cause unexpected 
      drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Several machine learning approaches have been 
      proposed to predict the occurrence of DDIs. However, existing approaches are 
      almost dependent heavily on various drug-related features, which may incur noisy 
      inductive bias. To alleviate this problem, we investigate the utilization of the 
      end-to-end graph representation learning for the DDI prediction task. We 
      establish a novel DDI prediction method named GCN-BMP (Graph Convolutional 
      Network with Bond-aware Message Propagation) to conduct an accurate prediction 
      for DDIs. Our experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that GCN-BMP can 
      achieve higher performance compared to various baseline approaches. Moreover, in 
      the light of the self-contained attention mechanism in our GCN-BMP, we could find 
      the most vital local atoms that conform to domain knowledge with certain 
      interpretability.

TI  - Advancing predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine in eyelid diseases: a 
      concerns-based and expandable screening system through structural dissection.
PG  - 387-400
LID - 10.1007/s13167-025-00401-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Early recognition of eyelid morphological abnormalities was 
      crucial, as untreated conditions could lead to blinding complications. An eyelid 
      screening system that could provide both anatomical and pathological information 
      was essential for formulating personalized treatment strategies. This study aimed 
      to develop a clinically concerns-based framework capable of identifying common 
      eyelid diseases requiring further intervention by evaluating individual 
      anatomical and pathological changes. This approach would enhance individualized 
      and efficient prevention, while supporting targeted treatment strategies. 
      METHODS: The eyelid disorder screening system, Eyetome, was developed based on a 
      morphological atlas and comprised four modules designed to identify 14 common 
      eyelid disorders and pathological changes. A total of 6180 eye patches were 
      analyzed to extract anatomical and pathological features. The performance of 
      Eyetome was evaluated using average accuracy (aACC) and F1 score, with 
      comparisons made against traditional models and ophthalmologists. To assess the 
      system's expandability, an additional test was conducted in a multimorbidity 
      scenario. RESULTS: Eyetome demonstrated high performance in recognizing single 
      diseases, achieving an aACC of 98.83% and an F1 score of 0.93. The system 
      outperformed classic models, with an aACC of 98.83% compared to 96.72% for 
      Desnet101 and 97.59% for Vit. Additionally, Eyetome's aACC exceeded that of a 
      junior ophthalmologist (JO) (97.11%) and was comparable to a senior 
      ophthalmologist (SO) (98.69%). In the extended multimorbidity dataset, Eyetome 
      maintained robust performance with an accuracy of 97.97%, surpassing JO (95.47%) 
      and closely matching SO (97.81%). CONCLUSIONS: This study developed a clinical 
      concerns-based system for screening and monitoring eyelid disorders, aimed at 
      supporting predictive diagnosis, preventing diseases progression, and 
      facilitating more effective, patient-centered treatment of common eyelid 
      disorders, aligning with the principles of predictive, preventive, and 
      personalized medicine (PPPM/3PM). The system's interpretability, scalability, and 
      user-friendly data acquisition design could further enhance its acceptance among 
      both doctors and patients, facilitating the shift from reactive medicine to 
      proactive precision medicine. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version

TI  - Deciphering genomic codes using advanced natural language processing techniques: 
      a scoping review.
PG  - 761-772
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocaf029 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The vast and complex nature of human genomic sequencing data presents 
      challenges for effective analysis. This review aims to investigate the 
      application of natural language processing (NLP) techniques, particularly large 
      language models (LLMs) and transformer architectures, in deciphering genomic 
      codes, focusing on tokenization, transformer models, and regulatory annotation 
      prediction. The goal of this review is to assess data and model accessibility in 
      the most recent literature, gaining a better understanding of the existing 
      capabilities and constraints of these tools in processing genomic sequencing 
      data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
      Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, our scoping review was conducted 
      across PubMed, Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and ACM Digital Library. 
      Studies were included if they focused on NLP methodologies applied to genomic 
      sequencing data analysis, without restrictions on publication date or article 
      type. RESULTS: A total of 26 studies published between 2021 and April 2024 were 
      selected for review. The review highlights that tokenization and transformer 
      models enhance the processing and understanding of genomic data, with 
      applications in predicting regulatory annotations like transcription-factor 
      binding sites and chromatin accessibility. DISCUSSION: The application of NLP and 
      LLMs to genomic sequencing data interpretation is a promising field that can help 
      streamline the processing of large-scale genomic data while also providing a 
      better understanding of its complex structures. It has the potential to drive 
      advancements in personalized medicine by offering more efficient and scalable 
      solutions for genomic analysis. Further research is also needed to discuss and 
      overcome current limitations, enhancing model transparency and applicability. 
      CONCLUSION: This review highlights the growing role of NLP, particularly LLMs, in 
      genomic sequencing data analysis. While these models improve data processing and 
      regulatory annotation prediction, challenges remain in accessibility and 
      interpretability. Further research is needed to refine their application in 
      genomics.

TI  - Exploring doctors' perspectives on precision medicine and AI in colorectal 
      cancer: opportunities and challenges for the doctor-patient relationship.
PG  - 283
LID - 10.1186/s12911-025-03134-0 [doi]
LID - 283
AB  - BACKGROUND: Precision medicine and artificial intelligence (AI) are increasingly 
      integrated into colorectal cancer (CRC) care, offering personalised treatment 
      strategies and data-driven decision support. While these technologies promise 
      improved outcomes, they also raise challenges concerning clinical 
      decision-making, the doctor-patient relationship, and ethics. This study explores 
      physicians' perspectives on integrating precision medicine and AI in CRC care. 
      METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted using semi-structured interviews with 
      ten CRC physicians from six European countries. Participants were recruited 
      through purposive and snowball sampling. Interviews were analysed using thematic 
      analysis. RESULTS: Three key themes emerged from the analysis. First, physicians 
      described precision medicine as a logical extension of existing tailoring 
      practices, offering new opportunities while introducing complexity. Many 
      expressed concerns about the blurred boundary between experimental and standard 
      treatments, noting potential implications for equity and ethical decision-making. 
      Second, AI was viewed as a future partner in care, with the potential to enhance 
      efficiency and assist in synthesising complex data. However, participants voiced 
      concerns about trust, clinical responsibility, and the lack of regulatory 
      clarity, particularly due to AI's "black box" nature. Finally, doctors reported 
      challenges in communicating both precision medicine and AI-based recommendations 
      to patients. They emphasised the importance of adapting communication strategies 
      to individual patients and highlighted the need for structured approaches to 
      ensure patient understanding and prevent miscommunication, especially when 
      dealing with uncertain outcomes or emerging technologies. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      findings highlight both the opportunities and challenges of integrating precision 
      medicine and AI in CRC care. Addressing concerns related to communication, 
      ethics, and regulation requires clear guidance and improved support for 
      clinicians. Precision medicine and AI enhance CRC care but demand robust 
      communication, regulation, and ethical safeguards to ensure transparency, trust, 
      and physician autonomy.

TI  - Flexynesis: A deep learning toolkit for bulk multi-omics data integration for 
      precision oncology and beyond.
PG  - 8261
LID - 10.1038/s41467-025-63688-5 [doi]
LID - 8261
AB  - Accurate decision making in precision oncology depends on integration of 
      multimodal molecular information, for which various deep learning methods have 
      been developed. However, most deep learning-based bulk multi-omics integration 
      methods lack transparency, modularity, deployability, and are limited to narrow 
      tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce Flexynesis, which streamlines 
      data processing, feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and marker discovery. 
      Users can choose from deep learning architectures or classical supervised machine 
      learning methods with a standardized input interface for single/multi-task 
      training and evaluation for regression, classification, and survival modeling. We 
      showcase the tool's capability across diverse use-cases in precision oncology. To 
      maximize accessibility, Flexynesis is available on PyPi, Guix, Bioconda, and the

AB  - AI is a critical component in healthcare, especially in the application of 
      precision medicine where patients' characteristics, including genetic makeup, 
      determine the treatment options that should be implemented. AI sorts big data, 
      predicting people's reactions to specific treatments, the right combinations of 
      drugs, and possible side effects, therefore increasing the efficiency of the 
      treatment process and decreasing negative outcomes. This article briefly presents 
      the ethical issues and concerns that might arise due to the integration of AI in 
      society, such as the privacy of data, the issues of bias in the algorithms, and 
      the issues of interpretability of the AI systems. Nevertheless, there is no doubt 
      that AI can bring qualitative changes in cancer care based on its potential to 
      enhance patient prognosis and reduce health care costs, as well as become a 
      defining feature of the standard of care.

TI  - AI-driven decision support systems and epistemic reliance: a qualitative study on 
      obstetricians' and midwives' perspectives on integrating AI-driven CTG into 
      clinical decision making.
PG  - 6
LID - 10.1186/s12910-023-00990-1 [doi]
LID - 6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Given that AI-driven decision support systems (AI-DSS) are intended 
      to assist in medical decision making, it is essential that clinicians are willing 
      to incorporate AI-DSS into their practice. This study takes as a case study the 
      use of AI-driven cardiotography (CTG), a type of AI-DSS, in the context of 
      intrapartum care. Focusing on the perspectives of obstetricians and midwives 
      regarding the ethical and trust-related issues of incorporating AI-driven tools 
      in their practice, this paper explores the conditions that AI-driven CTG must 
      fulfill for clinicians to feel justified in incorporating this assistive 
      technology into their decision-making processes regarding interventions in labor. 
      METHODS: This study is based on semi-structured interviews conducted online with 
      eight obstetricians and five midwives based in England. Participants were asked 
      about their current decision-making processes about when to intervene in labor, 
      how AI-driven CTG might enhance or disrupt this process, and what it would take 
      for them to trust this kind of technology. Interviews were transcribed verbatim 
      and analyzed with thematic analysis. NVivo software was used to organize thematic 
      codes that recurred in interviews to identify the issues that mattered most to 
      participants. Topics and themes that were repeated across interviews were 
      identified to form the basis of the analysis and conclusions of this paper. 
      RESULTS: There were four major themes that emerged from our interviews with 
      obstetricians and midwives regarding the conditions that AI-driven CTG must 
      fulfill: (1) the importance of accurate and efficient risk assessments; (2) the 
      capacity for personalization and individualized medicine; (3) the lack of 
      significance regarding the type of institution that develops technology; and (4) 
      the need for transparency in the development process. CONCLUSIONS: Accuracy, 
      efficiency, personalization abilities, transparency, and clear evidence that it 
      can improve outcomes are conditions that clinicians deem necessary for AI-DSS to 
      meet in order to be considered reliable and therefore worthy of being 
      incorporated into the decision-making process. Importantly, healthcare 
      professionals considered themselves as the epistemic authorities in the clinical 
      context and the bearers of responsibility for delivering appropriate care. 
      Therefore, what mattered to them was being able to evaluate the reliability of 
      AI-DSS on their own terms, and have confidence in implementing them in their 
      practice.

AB  - The application of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) models and algorithms in 
      clinical laboratories is a new inevitable stage of development of laboratory 
      medicine, since in the future, diagnostic and prognostic panels specific to 
      certain diseases will be created from a large amount of laboratory data. Thanks 
      to machine learning (ML), it is possible to analyze a large amount of structured 
      numerical data as well as unstructured digitized images in the field of 
      hematology, cytology and histopathology. Numerous researches refer to the testing 
      of ML models for the purpose of screening various diseases, detecting damage to 
      organ systems, diagnosing malignant diseases, longitudinal monitoring of various 
      biomarkers that would enable predicting the outcome of each patient's treatment. 
      The main advantages of advanced AI in the clinical laboratory are: faster 
      diagnosis using diagnostic and prognostic algorithms, individualization of 
      treatment plans, personalized medicine, better patient treatment outcomes, easier 
      and more precise longitudinal monitoring of biomarkers, etc. Disadvantages relate 
      to the lack of standardization, questionable quality of the entered data and 
      their interpretability, potential over-reliance on technology, new financial 
      investments, privacy concerns, ethical and legal aspects. Further integration of 
      advanced AI will gradually take place on the basis of the knowledge of 
      specialists in laboratory and clinical medicine, experts in information 
      technology and biostatistics, as well as on the basis of evidence-based 
      laboratory medicine. Clinical laboratories will be ready for the full and 
      successful integration of advanced AI once a balance has been established between 
      its potential and the resolution of existing obstacles.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Expanding the use of surface electromyography-biofeedback (EMG-BF) 
      devices in different therapeutic settings highlights the gradually evolving role 
      of visualizing muscle activity in the rehabilitation process. This review 
      evaluates their concepts, uses, and trends, combining evidence-based research. 
      AREAS COVERED: This review dissects the anatomy of EMG-BF systems, emphasizing 
      their transformative integration with machine-learning (ML) and deep-learning 
      (DL) paradigms. Advances such as the application of sophisticated DL 
      architectures for high-density EMG data interpretation, optimization techniques 
      for heightened DL model performance, and the fusion of EMG with 
      electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have been spotlighted for enhancing 
      biomechanical analyses in rehabilitation. The literature survey also categorizes 
      EMG-BF devices based on functionality and clinical usage, supported by insights 
      from commercial sectors. EXPERT OPINION: The current landscape of EMG-BF is 
      rapidly evolving, chiefly propelled by innovations in artificial intelligence 
      (AI). The incorporation of ML and DL into EMG-BF systems augments their accuracy, 
      reliability, and scope, marking a leap in patient care. Despite challenges in 
      model interpretability and signal noise, ongoing research promises to address 
      these complexities, refining biofeedback modalities. The integration of AI not 
      only predicts patient-specific recovery timelines but also tailors therapeutic 
      interventions, heralding a new era of personalized medicine in rehabilitation and 
      emotional detection.

      optimization, intelligent treatment and precision medicine, and has obtained a 
      certain achievement. But, there are still some problems remained to be solved 
      such as the poor interpretability of the model, the inconsistency of data quality 
      of acupuncture research, and the clinical application of constructed models. 
      Researches in future should focus on the acquisition of high-quality clinical and 
      experimental data sets, take various machine learning algorithms as the basis, 
      and construct professional models to solve various problems, so as to drive the

TI  - Enhancing psychiatric rehabilitation outcomes through a multimodal multitask 
      learning model based on BERT and TabNet: An approach for personalized treatment 
      and improved decision-making.

AB  - Evaluating the rehabilitation status of individuals with serious mental illnesses 
      (SMI) necessitates a comprehensive analysis of multimodal data, including 
      unstructured text records and structured diagnostic data. However, progress in 
      the effective assessment of rehabilitation status remains limited. Our study 
      develops a deep learning model integrating Bidirectional Encoder Representations 
      from Transformers (BERT) and TabNet through a late fusion strategy to enhance 
      rehabilitation prediction, including referral risk, dangerous behaviors, 
      self-awareness, and medication adherence, in patients with SMI. BERT processes 
      unstructured textual data, such as doctor's notes, whereas TabNet manages 
      structured diagnostic information. The model's interpretability function serves 
      to assist healthcare professionals in understanding the model's predictive 
      decisions, improving patient care. Our model exhibited excellent predictive 
      performance for all four tasks, with an accuracy exceeding 0.78 and an area under 
      the curve of 0.70. In addition, a series of tests proved the model's robustness, 
      fairness, and interpretability. This study combines multimodal and multitask 
      learning strategies into a model and applies it to rehabilitation assessment 
      tasks, offering a promising new tool that can be seamlessly integrated with the 
      clinical workflow to support the provision of optimized patient care.

      directions.
PG  - 3489-3508
LID - 10.1097/MS9.0000000000003279 [doi]
AB  - Predictive modeling for metastasis in oncology has gained significant traction 
      due to its potential to improve prognosis, guide treatment strategies and enhance 
      patient outcomes. Current methods leverage advancements in machine learning, 
      genomics and imaging technologies to predict the likelihood of cancer spread. 
      Techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines 
      and neural networks have been employed to analyze clinical, pathological, and 
      molecular data. Genomic profiling, liquid biopsies, and radiomics are 
      increasingly integrated into these models to identify metastatic patterns and 
      risk factors. Despite these advances, challenges persist, including data 
      heterogeneity, model interpretability, and the need for larger, high-quality 
      datasets for validation. Furthermore, the integration of artificial intelligence 
      with precision medicine offers promising avenues for more personalized metastasis 
      predictions. Future directions focus on enhancing model accuracy through deep 
      learning, improving the interpretability of black-box models, and incorporating 
      multi-omics data to capture the complexity of metastatic mechanisms. With the 
      advent of advanced computational tools and growing datasets, predictive modeling 
      in oncology is poised to revolutionize metastasis management, offering 
      clinicians' valuable insights for early detection and tailored treatment 
      strategies.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are transforming drug 
      discovery by overcoming traditional challenges like high costs, time-consuming, 
      and frequent failures. AI-driven approaches streamline key phases, including 
      target identification, lead optimization, de novo drug design, and drug 
      repurposing. Frameworks such as deep neural networks (DNNs), convolutional neural 
      networks (CNNs), and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) models have shown promise 
      in identifying drug targets, optimizing delivery systems, and accelerating drug 
      repurposing. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders 
      (VAEs) aid de novo drug design by creating novel drug-like compounds with desired 
      properties. Case studies, such as DDR1 kinase inhibitors designed using 
      generative models and CDK20 inhibitors developed via structure-based methods, 
      highlight AI's ability to produce highly specific therapeutics. Models like 
      SNF-CVAE and DeepDR further advance drug repurposing by uncovering new 
      therapeutic applications for existing drugs. Advanced ML algorithms enhance 
      precision in predicting drug efficacy, toxicity, and ADME-Tox properties, 
      reducing development costs and improving drug-target interactions. AI also 
      supports polypharmacology by optimizing multi-target drug interactions and 
      enhances combination therapy through predictions of drug synergies and 
      antagonisms. In nanomedicine, AI models like CURATE.AI and the Hartung algorithm 
      optimize personalized treatments by predicting toxicological risks and real-time 
      dosing adjustments with high accuracy. Despite its potential, challenges like 
      data quality, model interpretability, and ethical concerns must be addressed. 
      High-quality datasets, transparent models, and unbiased algorithms are essential 
      for reliable AI applications. As AI continues to evolve, it is poised to 
      revolutionize drug discovery and personalized medicine, advancing therapeutic 
      development and patient care.

AB  - Protein kinases are vital drug targets, yet designing selective inhibitors is 
      challenging, compounded by resistance and kinome complexity. This review explores 
      Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) modeling for kinase drug 
      discovery, focusing on integrating traditional QSAR with machine learning 
      (ML)-CNNs, RNNs-and structural data. Methods include structural databases, 
      docking, and deep learning QSAR. Key findings show ML-integrated QSAR 
      significantly improves selective inhibitor design for CDKs, JAKs, PIM kinases. 
      The IDG-DREAM challenge exemplifies ML's potential for accurate kinase-inhibitor 
      interaction prediction, outperforming traditional methods and enabling inhibitors 
      with enhanced selectivity, efficacy, and resistance mitigation. QSAR combined 
      with advanced computation and experimental data accelerates kinase drug 
      discovery, offering transformative precision medicine potential. This review 
      highlights deep learning-enhanced QSAR's novelty in automating feature extraction 
      and capturing complex relationships, surpassing traditional QSAR, while 
      emphasizing interpretability and experimental validation for clinical 
      translation.

TI  - Machine learning prediction and explanation of high intraoperative blood pressure 
      variability for noncardiac surgery using preoperative factors.
PG  - 581

AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study is to construct an explainable machine 
      learning predictive model for high intraoperative blood pressure 
      variability(IBPV) based on preoperative characteristics, to enhance 
      intraoperative circulatory management and surgical outcomes. This study utilized 
      a retrospective observational design, employing the eXtreme Gradient Boosting 
      (XGBoost) algorithm to create a predictive model for high IBPV. METHOD: The data 
      for the study were obtained from the central operating room of a major hospital 
      in Beijing, China, covering the period from March 2016 to April 2022. A total of 
      37,756 noncardiac surgeries were included in the analysis. The dataset comprised 
      demographic, preoperative laboratory, and diagnostic information. Selection 
      criteria included all noncardiac surgeries with complete preoperative data. High 
      IBPV was defined as a coefficient of variation exceeding 20% during the surgical 
      procedure. The main outcome measure was the prediction of high IBPV, assessed 
      using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, 
      and specificity. RESULTS: The XGBoost-based model achieved an accuracy of 0.81 
      and a specificity of 0.99, with a moderate discriminative ability (AUC = 0.60). 
      SHAP analysis identified age and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) 
      classification as the top positive predictors for high IBPV, with maximum SHAP 
      values of 0.4 and 0.2, respectively. Preoperative plasma albumin level was the 
      key negative predictor, with a maximum SHAP value of -0.6. Interactions between 
      preoperative blood calcium and age, and weight and age, were also influential. 
      The model quantified individual high IBPV risk probabilities and variable 
      contributions. CONCLUSIONS: The XGBoost model effectively identifies significant 
      predictors of high IBPV, including age, ASA classification, and plasma albumin 
      levels, and is capable of estimating individual risk probabilities. However, 
      external validation of the model in different clinical settings and populations 
      is needed to further confirm its predictive performance and generalizability.

AB  - Managing Parkinson's disease (PD) through medication can be challenging due to 
      varying symptoms and disease duration. This study aims to demonstrate the 
      potential of sequence-by-sequence algorithms in recommending personalized 
      medication combinations for patients with PD based on their previous visits. Our 
      proposed method employs a gated recurrent unit model to predict accurate 
      combinations of critical medication types for PD based on each patient's motor 
      symptoms and prescribed medication from previous visits. We built a multi-label 
      model with gated recurrent units on two data architectures: (1) personalized 
      input using each patient's previous visits as a sample and (2) non-personalized 
      input treating each visit as an independent sample. The 10-fold cross-validation 
      results showed that the personalized architecture model outperforms the 
      non-personalized model in accuracy (0.92), precision (0.94), recall (0.94), 
      F1-score (0.94), Hamming loss (0.03), and macro average area under the receiver 
      operating characteristic (0.94). To interpret the model's predictions, we 
      employed SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values, which provide insights into 
      the importance of variables both globally (across the entire model) and at the 
      individual patient level. The results contribute to the sequential-based decision 
      support system potentially enhancing the remote management of PD pharmacologic 
      issues.

TI  - Diabetic Tibial Neuropathy Prediction: Improving interpretability of Various 
      Machine-Learning Models Based on Multimodal-Ultrasound Features Using SHAP 
      Methodology.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and evaluate eight machine learning models 
      based on multimodal ultrasound to precisely predict of diabetic tibial neuropathy 
      (DTN) in patients. Additionally, the SHapley Additive exPlanations(SHAP)framework 
      was introduced to quantify the importance of each feature variable, providing a 
      precise and noninvasive assessment tool for DTN patients, optimizing clinical 
      management strategies, and enhancing patient prognosis. METHODS: A prospective 
      analysis was conducted using multimodal ultrasound and clinical data from 255 
      suspected DTN patients who visited the Second Affiliated Hospital of Fujian 
      Medical University between January 2024 and November 2024. Key features were 
      selected using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) 
      regression. Predictive models were constructed using Extreme Gradient Boosting 
      (XGB), Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, k-Nearest Neighbors, Random 
      Forest, Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, and Neural Network. The SHAP method was 
      employed to refine model interpretability. Furthermore, in order to verify the 
      generalization degree of the model, this study also collected 135 patients from 
      three other tertiary hospitals for external test. RESULTS: LASSO regression 
      identified Echo intensity(EI), Cross-sectional area (CSA), Mean elasticity 
      value(Emean), Superb microvascular imaging(SMI), and History of smoking were key 
      features for DTN prediction. The XGB model achieved an Area Under the Curve (AUC) 
      of 0.94, 0.83 and 0.79 in the training, internal test and external test sets, 
      respectively. SHAP analysis highlighted the ranking significance of EI, CSA, 
      Emean, SMI, and History of smoking. Personalized prediction explanations provided 
      by theSHAP values demonstrated the contribution of each feature to the final 
      prediction, and enhancing model interpretability. Furthermore, decision plots 
      depicted how different features influenced mispredictions, thereby facilitating 
      further model optimization or feature adjustment. CONCLUSION: This study proposed 
      a DTN prediction model based on machine-learning algorithms applied to multimodal 
      ultrasound data. The results indicated the superior performance of the XGB model 
      and its interpretability was enhanced using SHAP analysis. This cost-effective 
      and user-friendly approach provides potential support for personalized treatment 
      and precision medicine for DTN.

AB  - Radiomics, the extraction of quantitative data from images, holds promise for 
      noninvasively characterizing tumor phenotypes. Tools like LIFEx have improved the 
      accessibility, transparency, and reproducibility of radiomic feature extraction 
      by offering standardized, user-friendly workflows across imaging modalities. 
      Introduction of such a platform that enables consistent and transparent analytics 
      has helped democratize access to the exploration of radiomics and has highlighted 
      other fundamental challenges in radiomics, addressing upstream heterogeneity in 
      image acquisition, reconstruction, and region-of-interest segmentation that 
      impede reproducibility. Differences in these upstream steps can drastically alter 
      radiomic features, even when downstream processing is standardized. We highlight 
      ongoing efforts and fundamental challenges that the community will need to tackle 
      collectively to enable the clinical translation of radiomics. By addressing 
      variability throughout the radiomic pipeline, we can ensure that radiomic 
      features better reflect tumor biology, as well as fulfill their potential as 
      robust, generalizable biomarkers for precision oncology. This article is part of 
      a special series: Driving Cancer Discoveries with Computational Research, Data

TI  - scCapsNet-mask: an updated version of scCapsNet with extended applicability in 
      functional analysis related to scRNA-seq data.
PG  - 539
LID - 10.1186/s12859-022-05098-8 [doi]
LID - 539
AB  - BACKGROUND: With the rapid accumulation of scRNA-seq data, more and more 
      automatic cell type identification methods have been developed, especially those 
      based on deep learning. Although these methods have reached relatively high 
      prediction accuracy, many issues still exist. One is the interpretability. The 
      second is how to deal with the non-standard test samples that are not encountered 
      in the training process. RESULTS: Here we introduce scCapsNet-mask, an updated 
      version of scCapsNet. The scCapsNet-mask provides a reasonable solution to the 
      issues of interpretability and non-standard test samples. Firstly, the 
      scCapsNet-mask utilizes a mask to ease the task of model interpretation in the 
      original scCapsNet. The results show that scCapsNet-mask could constrain the 
      coupling coefficients, and make a one-to-one correspondence between the primary 
      capsules and type capsules. Secondly, the scCapsNet-mask can process non-standard 
      samples more reasonably. In one example, the scCapsNet-mask was trained on the 
      committed cells, and then tested on less differentiated cells as the non-standard 
      samples. It could not only estimate the lineage bias of less differentiated 
      cells, but also distinguish the development stages more accurately than 
      traditional machine learning models. Therefore, the pseudo-temporal order of 
      cells for each lineage could be established. Following these pseudo-temporal 
      order, lineage specific genes exhibit a gradual increase expression pattern and 
      stem cell associated genes exhibit a gradual decrease expression pattern. In 
      another example, the scCapsNet-mask was trained on scRNA-seq data, and then used 
      to assign cell type in spatial transcriptomics that may contain non-standard 
      sample of doublets. The results show that the scCapsNet-mask not only restored 
      the spatial map but also identified several non-standard samples of doublet. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The scCapsNet-mask offers a suitable solution to the challenge of 
      interpretability and non-standard test samples. By adding a mask, it has the 
      advantages of automatic processing and easy interpretation compared with the 
      original scCapsNet. In addition, the scCapsNet-mask could more accurately reflect 
      the composition of non-standard test samples than traditional machine learning 
      methods. Therefore, it can extend its applicability in functional analysis, such 
      as fate bias prediction in less differentiated cells and cell type assignment in 
      spatial transcriptomics.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a widespread disease with only 
      50%-60% 5-year survival. Individuals with potentially malignant precursor lesions 
      are at high risk. METHODS: Survival could be increased by effective, affordable, 
      and simple screening methods, along with a shift from incisional tissue biopsies 
      to non-invasive brush biopsies for cytology diagnosis, which are easy to perform 
      in primary care. Along with the explainable, fast, and objective artificial 
      intelligence characterisation of cells through deep learning, an easy-to-use, 
      rapid, and cost-effective methodology for finding high-risk lesions is 
      achievable. The collection of cytology samples offers the further opportunity of 
      explorative genomic analysis. RESULTS: Our prospective multicentre study of 
      patients with leukoplakia yields a vast number of oral keratinocytes. In addition 
      to cytopathological analysis, whole-slide imaging and the training of deep neural 
      networks, samples are analysed according to a single-cell RNA sequencing 
      protocol, enabling mapping of the entire keratinocyte transcriptome. Mapping the 
      changes in the genetic profile, based on mRNA expression, facilitates the 
      identification of biomarkers that predict cancer transformation. CONCLUSION: This 
      position paper highlights non-invasive methods for identifying patients with oral 
      mucosal lesions at risk of malignant transformation. Reliable non-invasive 
      methods for screening at-risk individuals bring the early diagnosis of OSCC 
      within reach. The use of biomarkers to decide on a targeted therapy is most 
      likely to improve the outcome. With the large-scale collection of samples 
      following patients over time, combined with genomic analysis and modern 
      machine-learning-based approaches for finding patterns in data, this path holds 
      great promise.

AB  - Personalized medicine aims to tailor medical treatments to individual patients, 
      and predicting drug responses from molecular profiles using machine learning is 
      crucial for this goal. However, the high dimensionality of the molecular profiles 
      compared to the limited number of samples presents significant challenges. 
      Knowledge-based feature selection methods are particularly suitable for drug 
      response prediction, as they leverage biological insights to reduce 
      dimensionality and improve model interpretability. This study presents the first 
      comparative evaluation of nine different knowledge-based and data-driven feature 
      reduction methods on cell line and tumor data. Our analysis employs six distinct 
      machine learning models, with a total of more than 6,000 runs to ensure a robust 
      evaluation. Our findings indicate that transcription factor activities outperform 
      other methods in predicting drug responses, effectively distinguishing between 
      sensitive and resistant tumors for seven of the 20 drugs evaluated.

TI  - A Novel Explainable Attention-Based Meta-Learning Framework for Imbalanced Brain 
      Stroke Prediction.
LID - 10.3390/s25061739 [doi]
LID - 1739
AB  - The accurate prediction of brain stroke is critical for effective diagnosis and 
      management, yet the imbalanced nature of medical datasets often hampers the 
      performance of conventional machine learning models. To address this challenge, 
      we propose a novel meta-learning framework that integrates advanced hybrid 
      resampling techniques, ensemble-based classifiers, and explainable artificial 
      intelligence (XAI) to enhance predictive performance and interpretability. The 
      framework employs SMOTE and SMOTEENN for handling class imbalance, dynamic 
      feature selection to reduce noise, and a meta-learning approach combining 
      predictions from Random Forest and LightGBM, and further refined by a deep 
      learning-based meta-classifier. The model uses SHAP (Shapley Additive 
      Explanations) to provide transparent insights into feature contributions, 
      increasing trust in its predictions. Evaluated on three datasets, DF-1, DF-2, and 
      DF-3, the proposed framework consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods, 
      achieving accuracy and F1-Score of 0.992189 and 0.992579 on DF-1, 0.980297 and 
      0.981916 on DF-2, and 0.981901 and 0.983365 on DF-3. These results validate the 
      robustness and effectiveness of the approach, significantly improving the 
      detection of minority-class instances while maintaining overall performance. This 
      work establishes a reliable solution for stroke prediction and provides a 
      foundation for applying meta-learning and explainable AI to other imbalanced 
      medical prediction tasks.

TI  - Composite interaction tree for simultaneous learning of optimal individualized 
      treatment rules and subgroups.
PG  - 2632-2651
LID - 10.1002/sim.8105 [doi]
AB  - Treatment response heterogeneity has long been observed in patients affected by 
      chronic diseases. Administering an individualized treatment rule (ITR) offers an 
      opportunity to tailor treatment strategies according to patient-specific 
      characteristics. Overly complex machine learning methods for estimating ITRs may 
      produce treatment rules that have higher benefit but lack transparency and 
      interpretability. In clinical practices, it is desirable to derive a simple and 
      interpretable ITR while maintaining certain optimality that leads to improved 
      benefit in subgroups of patients, if not on the overall sample. In this work, we 
      propose a tree-based robust learning method to estimate optimal piecewise linear 
      ITRs and identify subgroups of patients with a large benefit. We achieve these 
      goals by simultaneously identifying qualitative and quantitative interactions 
      through a tree model, referred to as the composite interaction tree (CITree). We 
      show that it has improved performance compared to existing methods on both 
      overall sample and subgroups via extensive simulation studies. Lastly, we fit 
      CITree to Research Evaluating the Value of Augmenting Medication with 
      Psychotherapy trial for treating patients with major depressive disorders, where 
      we identified both qualitative and quantitative interactions and subgroups of 
      patients with a large benefit.

TI  - Toward rapid infectious disease diagnosis with advances in surface-enhanced Raman 
      spectroscopy.
PG  - 240902
LID - 10.1063/1.5142767 [doi]
AB  - In a pandemic era, rapid infectious disease diagnosis is essential. 
      Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) promises sensitive and specific 
      diagnosis including rapid point-of-care detection and drug susceptibility 
      testing. SERS utilizes inelastic light scattering arising from the interaction of 
      incident photons with molecular vibrations, enhanced by orders of magnitude with 
      resonant metallic or dielectric nanostructures. While SERS provides a spectral 
      fingerprint of the sample, clinical translation is lagged due to challenges in 
      consistency of spectral enhancement, complexity in spectral interpretation, 
      insufficient specificity and sensitivity, and inefficient workflow from patient 
      sample collection to spectral acquisition. Here, we highlight the recent, 
      complementary advances that address these shortcomings, including (1) design of 
      label-free SERS substrates and data processing algorithms that improve spectral 
      signal and interpretability, essential for broad pathogen screening assays; (2) 
      development of new capture and affinity agents, such as aptamers and polymers, 
      critical for determining the presence or absence of particular pathogens; and (3) 
      microfluidic and bioprinting platforms for efficient clinical sample processing. 
      We also describe the development of low-cost, point-of-care, optical SERS 
      hardware. Our paper focuses on SERS for viral and bacterial detection, in hopes 
      of accelerating infectious disease diagnosis, monitoring, and vaccine 
      development. With advances in SERS substrates, machine learning, and 
      microfluidics and bioprinting, the specificity, sensitivity, and speed of SERS 
      can be readily translated from laboratory bench to patient bedside, accelerating 
      point-of-care diagnosis, personalized medicine, and precision health.

TI  - An explainable AI approach for mapping multivariate regional brain age and 
      clinical severity patterns in Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Age is a significant risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) and identifying brain age patterns is critical for 
      comprehending the normal aging and MCI/AD processes. Prior studies have widely 
      established the univariate relationships between brain regions and age, while 
      multivariate associations remain largely unexplored. Herein, various artificial 
      intelligence (AI) models were used to perform brain age prediction using an MRI 
      dataset (n = 825). The optimal AI model was then integrated with the feature 
      importance methods, namely Shapley additive explanations (SHAP), local 
      interpretable model-agnostic explanations, and layer-wise relevance propagation, 
      to identify the significant multivariate brain regions hierarchically involved in 
      this prediction. Our results showed that the deep learning model (referred to as 
      AgeNet) outperformed conventional machine learning models for brain age 
      prediction, and that AgeNet integrated with SHAP (referred to as AgeNet-SHAP) 
      identified all ground-truth perturbed regions as key predictors of brain age in 
      semi-simulation, demonstrating the validity of our methodology. In the 
      experimental dataset, when compared to cognitively normal (CN) participants, MCI 
      exhibited moderate differences in brain regions, whereas AD showed highly robust 
      and widely distributed regional differences. Individualized AgeNet-SHAP regional 
      features further showed associations with clinical severity scores in the AD 
      continuum. These results collectively facilitate data-driven explainable AI 
      approaches for disease progression, diagnostics, prognostics, and personalized 
      medicine efforts.

TI  - Structural variants identified using non-Mendelian inheritance patterns advance 
      the mechanistic understanding of autism spectrum disorder.
PG  - 100150
LID - 10.1016/j.xhgg.2022.100150 [doi]
LID - 100150
AB  - The heritability of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), based on 680,000 families and 
      five countries, is estimated to be nearly 80%, yet heritability reported from 
      SNP-based studies are consistently lower, and few significant loci have been 
      identified with genome-wide association studies. This gap in genomic information 
      may reside in rare variants, interaction among variants (epistasis), or cryptic 
      structural variation (SV) and may provide mechanisms that underlie ASD. Here we 
      use a method to identify potential SVs based on non-Mendelian inheritance 
      patterns in pedigrees using parent-child genotypes from ASD families and 
      demonstrate that they are enriched in ASD-risk genes. Most are in non-coding 
      genic space and are over-represented in expression quantitative trait loci, 
      suggesting that they affect gene regulation, which we confirm with their overlap 
      of differentially expressed genes in postmortem brain tissue of ASD individuals. 
      We then identify an SV in the GRIK2 gene that alters RNA splicing and a 
      regulatory region of the ACMSD gene in the kynurenine pathway as significantly 
      associated with a non-verbal ASD phenotype, supporting our hypothesis that these 
      currently excluded loci can provide a clearer mechanistic understanding of ASD. 
      Finally, we use an explainable artificial intelligence approach to define 
      subgroups demonstrating their use in the context of precision medicine.

TI  - Interpretable Prediction of Myocardial Infarction Using Explainable Boosting 
      Machines: A Biomarker-Based Machine Learning Approach.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics15172219 [doi]
LID - 2219
AB  - Background/Objectives: This study aims to build an interpretable and accurate 
      predictive model for myocardial infarction (MI) using Explainable Boosting 
      Machines (EBM), a state-of-the-art Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) 
      technique. The objective is to identify and rank clinically relevant biomarkers 
      that contribute to MI diagnosis while maintaining transparency to support 
      clinical decision making. Methods: The dataset comprises 1319 patient records 
      collected in 2018 from a cardiology center in the Erbil region of Iraq. Each 
      record includes eight routinely measured clinical and biochemical features, such 
      as troponin, CK-MB, and glucose levels, and a binary outcome variable indicating 
      the presence or absence of MI. After preprocessing (e.g., one-hot encoding, 
      normalization), the EBM model was trained using 80% of the data and tested on the 
      remaining 20%. Model performance was evaluated using standard metrics including 
      AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and Matthews correlation 
      coefficient. Feature importance was assessed to identify key predictors. Partial 
      dependence analyses provided insights into how each variable affected model 
      predictions. Results: The EBM model demonstrated excellent diagnostic 
      performance, achieving an AUC of 0.980, an accuracy of 96.6%, sensitivity of 
      96.8%, and specificity of 96.2%. Troponin and CK-MB were identified as the top 
      predictors, confirming their established clinical relevance in MI diagnosis. In 
      contrast, demographic and hemodynamic variables such as age and blood pressure 
      contributed minimally. Partial dependence plots revealed non-linear effects of 
      key biomarkers. Local explanation plots demonstrated the model's ability to make 
      confident, interpretable predictions for both positive and negative cases. 
      Conclusions: The findings highlight the potential of EBM as a clinically useful 
      and ethical AI approach for MI diagnosis. By combining high predictive accuracy 
      with transparency, EBM supports biomarker prioritization and clinical risk 
      stratification, thus aligning with precision medicine and responsible AI 
      principles. Future research should validate the model on multi-center datasets 
      and explore additional features for broader clinical use.

AB  - Injuries to the spinal cord nervous system often result in permanent loss of 
      sensory, motor, and autonomic functions. Accurately identifying the cellular 
      state of spinal cord nerves is extremely important and could facilitate the 
      development of new therapeutic and rehabilitative strategies. Existing 
      experimental techniques for identifying the development of spinal cord nerves are 
      both labor-intensive and costly. In this study, we developed a machine learning 
      predictor, ScnML, for predicting subpopulations of spinal cord nerve cells as 
      well as identifying marker genes. The prediction performance of ScnML was 
      evaluated on the training dataset with an accuracy of 94.33%. Based on XGBoost, 
      ScnML on the test dataset achieved 94.08% 94.24%, 94.26%, and 94.24% accuracies 
      with precision, recall, and F1-measure scores, respectively. Importantly, ScnML 
      identified new significant genes through model interpretation and biological 
      landscape analysis. ScnML can be a powerful tool for predicting the status of 
      spinal cord neuronal cells, revealing potential specific biomarkers quickly and 
      efficiently, and providing crucial insights for precision medicine and 
      rehabilitation recovery.

TI  - Comparing machine learning models for predicting preoperative DVT incidence in 
      elderly hypertensive patients with hip fractures: a retrospective analysis.
PG  - 13206

LID - 13206
AB  - Hip fractures in the elderly present a significant public health challenge 
      globally, especially among patients with hypertension, who are at an increased 
      risk of developing preoperative deep vein thrombosis (DVT). DVT not only 
      heightens surgical risks but also severely impacts the rehabilitation and quality 
      of life of patients. Early risk assessment and management in this population are 
      therefore critically important. This study aimed to develop and validate a 
      machine learning-based predictive model to enhance the accuracy of predicting 
      preoperative DVT in elderly patients with hypertension undergoing hip fracture 
      surgery, thereby optimizing preoperative assessment and management. A 
      retrospective study design was employed, selecting patients with hypertension and 
      hip fractures treated at the First Hospital of Qinhuangdao from January 2018 to 
      December 2022. Key predictive factors were identified using LASSO regression, and 
      logistic regression was utilized to construct both a nomogram and an online 
      interactive nomogram. Various machine learning algorithms were also employed to 
      build predictive models. The contribution of variables in the models was 
      explained using SHAP values, and model performance was evaluated through ROC 
      curves, AUC values, and other statistical methods. The study included 637 
      patients, with LASSO regression selecting key variables that were further used to 
      develop a logistic regression-based nomogram and its online version, providing 
      intuitive tools for assessing DVT incidence. Among the multiple machine learning 
      predictive models, the LightGBM model exhibited the best performance, achieving 
      an AUC of 0.910. The model's effectiveness and reliability were confirmed through 
      decision curves, calibration plots, and precision-recall curves. SHAP value 
      analysis highlighted the significance of factors such as age, time from injury to 
      hospital admission, atrial fibrillation, C-reactive protein, hypoalbuminemia, and 
      D-dimer levels in the predictions, enhancing the model's transparency and 
      interpretability. This study successfully developed a logistic regression-based 
      nomogram and multiple machine learning algorithms to predict the risk of 
      preoperative DVT in elderly hypertensive patients with hip fractures. The 
      nomogram provides clinicians with a practical tool for rapid risk assessment, 
      thus optimizing patient management and prognosis. The LightGBM model, recommended 
      for its high predictive accuracy, along with SHAP value analysis, enhanced the 
      transparency and clinical applicability of the models. These findings not only 
      deepen our understanding of DVT incidence factors but also demonstrate the 
      potential of machine learning technologies in enhancing medical decision-making 
      and advancing precision medicine.

AB  - This systematic review examines the transformative impact of artificial 
      intelligence (AI), including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), on 
      cardiovascular signal analysis, focusing on electrocardiograms (ECG), 
      phonocardiograms (PCG), and photoplethysmograms (PPG). It evaluates 
      state-of-the-art methodologies that enhance diagnostic accuracy and predictive 
      analytics by leveraging AI-driven systems. A wide range of public and private 
      datasets are assessed, with attention to their strengths and limitations in 
      supporting cardiovascular diagnostics. Key preprocessing techniques, such as 
      noise reduction, signal normalization, and artifact mitigation, are explored for 
      their role in improving signal quality. The review also highlights feature 
      extraction methods, from time-domain and frequency-domain analyses to advanced 
      morphological and spectral approaches, which contribute to robust classifier 
      performance. Traditional ML models, such as K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support 
      Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests (RF), are compared with advanced DL 
      architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term 
      Memory networks (LSTMs), and transfer learning models for detecting 
      cardiovascular diseases. Despite these advancements, challenges such as dataset 
      heterogeneity, preprocessing variability, and computational complexity persist, 
      hindering clinical adoption. The review underscores the importance of 
      large-scale, diverse datasets, multi-modal signal integration, and explainable AI 
      to foster clinical trust and facilitate ethical deployment. By addressing these 
      challenges, this review highlights the potential of AI to revolutionize 
      cardiovascular healthcare through early diagnosis, wearable technology, and 
      real-time decision support, paving the way for precision medicine and improved 
      patient outcomes.

TI  - Untargeted Lipidomic Biomarkers for Liver Cancer Diagnosis: A Tree-Based Machine 
      Learning Model Enhanced by Explainable Artificial Intelligence.
LID - 10.3390/medicina61030405 [doi]
LID - 405
AB  - Background and Objectives: Liver cancer ranks among the leading causes of 
      cancer-related mortality, necessitating the development of novel diagnostic 
      methods. Deregulated lipid metabolism, a hallmark of hepatocarcinogenesis, offers 
      compelling prospects for biomarker identification. This study aims to employ 
      explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to identify lipidomic biomarkers for 
      liver cancer and to develop a robust predictive model for early diagnosis. 
      Materials and Methods: This study included 219 patients diagnosed with liver 
      cancer and 219 healthy controls. Serum samples underwent untargeted lipidomic 
      analysis with LC-QTOF-MS. Lipidomic data underwent univariate and multivariate 
      analyses, including fold change (FC), t-tests, PLS-DA, and Elastic Network 
      feature selection, to identify significant biomarker candidate lipids. Machine 
      learning models (AdaBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) were developed and 
      evaluated utilizing these biomarkers to differentiate liver cancer. The AUC 
      metric was employed to identify the optimal predictive model, whereas SHAP was 
      utilized to achieve interpretability of the model's predictive decisions. 
      Results: Notable alterations in lipid profiles were observed: decreased 
      sphingomyelins (SM d39:2, SM d41:2) and increased fatty acids (FA 14:1, FA 22:2) 
      and phosphatidylcholines (PC 34:1, PC 32:1). AdaBoost exhibited a superior 
      classification performance, achieving an AUC of 0.875. SHAP identified PC 40:4 as 
      the most efficacious lipid for model predictions. The SM d41:2 and SM d36:3 
      lipids were specifically associated with an increased risk of low-onset cancer 
      and elevated levels of the PC 40:4 lipid. Conclusions: This study demonstrates 
      that untargeted lipidomics, in conjunction with explainable artificial 
      intelligence (XAI) and machine learning, may effectively identify biomarkers for 
      the early detection of liver cancer. The results suggest that alterations in 
      lipid metabolism are crucial to the progression of liver cancer and provide 
      valuable insights for incorporating lipidomics into precision oncology.

      Reduced drug uptake, enhanced drug efflux, impaired pro-drug activation or 
      increased inactivation, molecular target alterations, enhanced DNA damage repair, 
      imbalance in apoptotic regulation, tumor microenvironment modifications, and 
      phenotypic changes. Additionally, the role of AI in addressing these challenges 
      is explored, with a focus on omics-driven insights, pathway analysis, biomarker 
      discovery, and modeling drug-response relationships. RESULTS: The review 
      highlights the transformative potential of AI in advancing precision therapy for 
      GC. Key applications include therapeutic stratification, optimization of drug 
      combinations, adaptive therapy design, and integration with clinical workflows. 
      Challenges such as data quality, model interpretability, and the need for 
      interdisciplinary collaboration are identified, along with strategies to address 
      these barriers. Future directions emphasize the development of explainable AI 
      models, integration of multi-omics and real-time patient data, and AI-driven drug 
      discovery targeting resistance pathways. CONCLUSIONS: By bridging research and 
      clinical practice, AI offers a promising path to more effective, personalized, 
      and adaptive therapeutic strategies for GC. Overcoming existing challenges and 
      leveraging AI's potential can significantly improve treatment outcomes and 
      address the pressing issue of drug resistance in GC.

TI  - Machine Learning to Predict Mortality and Critical Events in a Cohort of Patients 
      With COVID-19 in New York City: Model Development and Validation.
PG  - e24018
LID - 10.2196/24018 [doi]
LID - e24018
AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has infected millions of people worldwide and is responsible 
      for several hundred thousand fatalities. The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated 
      thoughtful resource allocation and early identification of high-risk patients. 
      However, effective methods to meet these needs are lacking. OBJECTIVE: The aims 
      of this study were to analyze the electronic health records (EHRs) of patients 
      who tested positive for COVID-19 and were admitted to hospitals in the Mount 
      Sinai Health System in New York City; to develop machine learning models for 
      making predictions about the hospital course of the patients over clinically 
      meaningful time horizons based on patient characteristics at admission; and to 
      assess the performance of these models at multiple hospitals and time points. 
      METHODS: We used Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and baseline comparator 
      models to predict in-hospital mortality and critical events at time windows of 3, 
      5, 7, and 10 days from admission. Our study population included harmonized EHR 
      data from five hospitals in New York City for 4098 COVID-19-positive patients 
      admitted from March 15 to May 22, 2020. The models were first trained on patients 
      from a single hospital (n=1514) before or on May 1, externally validated on 
      patients from four other hospitals (n=2201) before or on May 1, and prospectively 
      validated on all patients after May 1 (n=383). Finally, we established model 
      interpretability to identify and rank variables that drive model predictions. 
      RESULTS: Upon cross-validation, the XGBoost classifier outperformed baseline 
      models, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) 
      for mortality of 0.89 at 3 days, 0.85 at 5 and 7 days, and 0.84 at 10 days. 
      XGBoost also performed well for critical event prediction, with an AUC-ROC of 
      0.80 at 3 days, 0.79 at 5 days, 0.80 at 7 days, and 0.81 at 10 days. In external 
      validation, XGBoost achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.88 at 3 days, 0.86 at 5 days, 0.86 
      at 7 days, and 0.84 at 10 days for mortality prediction. Similarly, the unimputed 
      XGBoost model achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.78 at 3 days, 0.79 at 5 days, 0.80 at 7 
      days, and 0.81 at 10 days. Trends in performance on prospective validation sets 
      were similar. At 7 days, acute kidney injury on admission, elevated LDH, 
      tachypnea, and hyperglycemia were the strongest drivers of critical event 
      prediction, while higher age, anion gap, and C-reactive protein were the 
      strongest drivers of mortality prediction. CONCLUSIONS: We externally and 
      prospectively trained and validated machine learning models for mortality and 
      critical events for patients with COVID-19 at different time horizons. These 
      models identified at-risk patients and uncovered underlying relationships that 
      predicted outcomes.

AB  - The intersection of precision medicine and artificial intelligence (AI) holds 
      profound implications for cancer treatment, with the potential to significantly 
      advance our understanding of drug responses based on the intricate architecture 
      of tumor cells. A recent study by Park and colleagues titled "A Deep Learning 
      Model of Tumor Cell Architecture Elucidates Response and Resistance to CDK4/6 
      Inhibitors" epitomizes this intersection by leveraging an interpretable deep 
      learning model grounded in a comprehensive map of multiprotein assemblies in 
      cancer, known as Nested Systems in Tumors. This study not only elucidates 
      mechanisms underlying the response to CDK4/6 inhibitors in breast cancer therapy 
      but also highlights the critical role of model interpretability leading to new 
      mechanistic insights.

TI  - protPheMut: An Interpretable Machine Learning Tool for Classification of Cancer 
      and Neurodevelopmental Disorders in Human Missense Mutations.
PG  - 8375-8384
LID - 10.1021/acs.jcim.5c01219 [doi]
AB  - Recent advances in human genomics have revealed that missense mutations in a 
      single protein can lead to distinctly different phenotypes. In particular, some 
      mutations in oncoproteins like MEK1, MEK2, PI3Kα, PTEN, SHAP2, and RAS are linked 
      various cancers and neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). While numerous tools 
      exist for predicting the pathogenicity of missense mutations, linking these 
      mutations to certain phenotypes remains a major challenge, particularly in the 
      context of personalized medicine. To fill this gap, we developed protPheMut 
      (Protein Phenotypic Mutations Analyzer, http://netprotlab.com/protPheMut), 
      leveraging interpretable machine learning approaches and enhancing model 
      transparency through SHAP explanations, to integrate diverse biophysical and 
      network dynamics-based signatures for predicting whether mutations in the same 
      protein promote cancer or NDDs. Overall, proPheMut achieved an AUCROC of 0.9118 
      in cross-validation and 0.8925 on an independent test set for discriminating 
      cancer- versus NDDs-related mutations. We further illustrate its utility in 
      phenotype (cancer/NDDs) prediction by mutation analyses of two protein cases, 
      PI3Kα and PTEN. Compared to seven other predictive tools, protPheMut demonstrated 
      exceptional accuracy in forecasting phenotypic effects, achieving an AUROC of 
      0.8501 for PI3Kα mutations related to cancer and Cowden syndrome. For 
      multi-phenotype prediction of PTEN mutations related to cancer, PHTS, and HCPS, 
      protPheMut achieved an AUROC of 0.9349 through micro averaging. Using SHAP model 
      explanations, protPheMut highlights the strength of network and dynamic features 
      in deeper uncovering of the effects of pathogenic mutations, thus classifying 
      different disease phenotypes.

TI  - A gradient mapping guided explainable deep neural network for extracapsular 
      extension identification in 3D head and neck cancer computed tomography images.
PG  - 2007-2019
LID - 10.1002/mp.16680 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diagnosis and treatment management for head and neck squamous cell 
      carcinoma (HNSCC) is guided by routine diagnostic head and neck computed 
      tomography (CT) scans to identify tumor and lymph node features. The 
      extracapsular extension (ECE) is a strong predictor of patients' survival 
      outcomes with HNSCC. It is essential to detect the occurrence of ECE as it 
      changes staging and treatment planning for patients. Current clinical ECE 
      detection relies on visual identification and pathologic confirmation conducted 
      by clinicians. However, manual annotation of the lymph node region is a required 
      data preprocessing step in most of the current machine learning-based ECE 
      diagnosis studies. PURPOSE: In this paper, we propose a Gradient Mapping Guided 
      Explainable Network (GMGENet) framework to perform ECE identification 
      automatically without requiring annotated lymph node region information. METHODS: 
      The gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) technique is applied to 
      guide the deep learning algorithm to focus on the regions that are highly related 
      to ECE. The proposed framework includes an extractor and a classifier. In a joint 
      training process, informative volumes of interest (VOIs) are extracted by the 
      extractor without labeled lymph node region information, and the classifier 
      learns the pattern to classify the extracted VOIs into ECE positive and negative. 
      RESULTS: In evaluation, the proposed methods are well-trained and tested using 
      cross-validation. GMGENet achieved test accuracy and area under the curve (AUC) 
      of 92.2% and 89.3%, respectively. GMGENetV2 achieved 90.3% accuracy and 91.7% AUC 
      in the test. The results were compared with different existing models and further 
      confirmed and explained by generating ECE probability heatmaps via a Grad-CAM 
      technique. The presence or absence of ECE has been analyzed and correlated with 
      ground truth histopathological findings. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed deep network 
      can learn meaningful patterns to identify ECE without providing lymph node 
      contours. The introduced ECE heatmaps will contribute to the clinical 
      implementations of the proposed model and reveal unknown features to 
      radiologists. The outcome of this study is expected to promote the implementation 
      of explainable artificial intelligence-assiste ECE detection.

PG  - 1595291

LID - 1595291
AB  - BACKGROUND: Biomarker discovery and drug response prediction are central to 
      personalized medicine, driving demand for predictive models that also offer 
      biological insights. Biologically informed neural networks (BINNs), also referred 
      to as visible neural networks (VNNs), have recently emerged as a solution to this 
      goal. BINNs or VNNs are neural networks whose inter-layer connections are 
      constrained based on prior knowledge from gene ontologies and pathway databases. 
      These sparse models enhance interpretability by embedding prior knowledge into 
      their architecture, ideally reducing the space of learnable functions to those 
      that are biologically meaningful. METHODS: This systematic review-the first of 
      its kind-identified 86 recent papers implementing BINNs/VNNs. We analyzed these 
      papers to highlight key trends in architectural design, data sources and 
      evaluation methodologies. RESULTS: Our analysis reveals a growing adoption of 
      BINNs/VNNs. However, this growth is apparently juxtaposed with a lack of 
      standardized, terminology, computational tools and benchmarks. CONCLUSION: 
      BINNs/VNNs represent a promising approach for integrating biological knowledge 
      into predictive models for personalized medicine. Addressing the current 
      deficiencies in standardization and tooling is important for widespread adoption 
      and further progress in the field.

TI  - New horizons in prediction modelling using machine learning in older people's 
      healthcare research.
LID - 10.1093/ageing/afae201 [doi]
LID - afae201
AB  - Machine learning (ML) and prediction modelling have become increasingly 
      influential in healthcare, providing critical insights and supporting clinical 
      decisions, particularly in the age of big data. This paper serves as an 
      introductory guide for health researchers and readers interested in prediction 
      modelling and explores how these technologies support clinical decisions, 
      particularly with big data, and covers all aspects of the development, assessment 
      and reporting of a model using ML. The paper starts with the importance of 
      prediction modelling for precision medicine. It outlines different types of 
      prediction and machine learning approaches, including supervised, unsupervised 
      and semi-supervised learning, and provides an overview of popular algorithms for 
      various outcomes and settings. It also introduces key theoretical ML concepts. 
      The importance of data quality, preprocessing and unbiased model performance 
      evaluation is highlighted. Concepts of apparent, internal and external validation 
      will be introduced along with metrics for discrimination and calibration for 
      different types of outcomes. Additionally, the paper addresses model 
      interpretation, fairness and implementation in clinical practice. Finally, the 
      paper provides recommendations for reporting and identifies common pitfalls in 
      prediction modelling and machine learning. The aim of the paper is to help 
      readers understand and critically evaluate research papers that present ML models 
      and to serve as a first guide for developing, assessing and implementing their 
      own.

TI  - Ethical use of artificial intelligence to prevent sudden cardiac death: an 
      interview study of patient perspectives.
PG  - 42
LID - 10.1186/s12910-024-01042-y [doi]
LID - 42
AB  - BACKGROUND: The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine has 
      prompted the development of numerous ethical guidelines, while the involvement of 
      patients in the creation of these documents lags behind. As part of the European 
      PROFID project we explore patient perspectives on the ethical implications of AI 
      in care for patients at increased risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD). AIM: 
      Explore perspectives of patients on the ethical use of AI, particularly in 
      clinical decision-making regarding the implantation of an implantable 
      cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). METHODS: Semi-structured, future scenario-based 
      interviews were conducted among patients who had either an ICD and/or a heart 
      condition with increased risk of SCD in Germany (n = 9) and the Netherlands 
      (n = 15). We used the principles of the European Commission's Ethics Guidelines 
      for Trustworthy AI to structure the interviews. RESULTS: Six themes arose from 
      the interviews: the ability of AI to rectify human doctors' limitations; the 
      objectivity of data; whether AI can serve as second opinion; AI explainability 
      and patient trust; the importance of the 'human touch'; and the personalization 
      of care. Overall, our results reveal a strong desire among patients for more 
      personalized and patient-centered care in the context of ICD implantation. 
      Participants in our study express significant concerns about the further loss of 
      the 'human touch' in healthcare when AI is introduced in clinical settings. They 
      believe that this aspect of care is currently inadequately recognized in clinical 
      practice. Participants attribute to doctors the responsibility of evaluating AI 
      recommendations for clinical relevance and aligning them with patients' 
      individual contexts and values, in consultation with the patient. CONCLUSION: The 
      'human touch' patients exclusively ascribe to human medical practitioners extends 
      beyond sympathy and kindness, and has clinical relevance in medical 
      decision-making. Because this cannot be replaced by AI, we suggest that normative 
      research into the 'right to a human doctor' is needed. Furthermore, policies on 
      patient-centered AI integration in clinical practice should encompass the ethics 
      of everyday practice rather than only principle-based ethics. We suggest that an 
      empirical ethics approach grounded in ethnographic research is exceptionally 
      well-suited to pave the way forward.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI)/deep learning (DL) models that predict molecular 
      phenotypes like gene expression directly from DNA sequences have recently 
      emerged. While these models have proven effective at capturing the variation 
      across genes, their ability to explain inter-individual differences has been 
      limited. We hypothesize that the performance gap can be narrowed through the use 
      of pre-trained embeddings from the Nucleotide Transformer, a large foundation 
      model trained on 3,000+ genomes. We train a transformer model using the 
      pre-trained embeddings and compare its predictive performance to Enformer, the 
      current state-of-the-art model, using genotype and expression data from 290 
      individuals. Our model significantly outperforms Enformer in terms of correlation 
      across individuals, and narrows the performance gap with an elastic net 
      regression approach that uses just the genetic variants as predictors. Although 
      simple regression models have their advantages in personalized prediction tasks, 
      DL approaches based on foundation models pre-trained on diverse genomes have 
      unique strengths in flexibility and interpretability. With further methodological 
      and computational improvements with more training data, these models may 
      eventually predict molecular phenotypes from DNA sequences with an accuracy 
      surpassing that of regression-based approaches. Our work demonstrates the 
      potential for large pre-trained AI/DL models to advance functional genomics.

TI  - Prediction of the development of contrast‑induced nephropathy following 
      percutaneous coronary artery intervention by machine learning.
PG  - 912-921
LID - 10.1080/00015385.2023.2198937 [doi]
AB  - Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is associated with increased mortality and 
      morbidity in patients with coronary artery disease undergoing elective 
      percutaneous coronary intervention(PCI). We developed a machine learning-based 
      risk stratification model to predict contrast-induced nephropathy after PCI. A 
      study retrospectively enrolling 240 patients eligible for PCI from December 2017 
      to May 2020 was performed. CIN was defined as a rise in serum creatinine levels 
      ≥0.5 mg/dL or ≥25% from baseline within 72 h after surgery. Eight machine 
      learning methods were performed based on clinical variables. Shapley Additive 
      exPlanation values were also used to interpret the best-performing prediction 
      models. Development of CIN was found in 37 patients(16.5%) after PCI. There were 
      11 significant predictors of CIN, including uric acid, peripheral vascular 
      disease, cystatin C, creatine kinase-MB, haemoglobin, N-terminal pro-brain 
      natriuretic peptide, age, diabetes, systemic immune-inflammatory index, total 
      protein, and low-density lipoprotein. Regarding the efficacy of the machine 
      learning model that accurately predicted CIN, SVM exhibited the most outstanding 
      AUC value of 0.784. The SHAP and radar plots were used to illustrate the positive 
      and negative effects of the 11 features attributed to the SVM. Machine learning 
      models have the potential to identify the risk of CIN for elective PCI patients.

TI  - Using Real-World Data for Machine-Learning Algorithms to Predict the Treatment 
      Response in Advanced Melanoma: A Pilot Study for Personalizing Cancer Care.
PG  - e2400181
LID - 10.1200/CCI-24-00181 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The use of real-world data (RWD) in oncology is becoming increasingly 
      important for clinical decision making and tailoring treatment. Despite the 
      significant success of targeted therapy and immunotherapy in advanced melanoma, 
      substantial variability in clinical responses to these treatments emphasizes the 
      need for personalized approaches to therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this pilot 
      study, 239 patients with melanoma were included to predict the response to both 
      targeted therapies and immunotherapies. We used machine learning (ML) to 
      incorporate RWD and applied explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to explain 
      the individual predictions. RESULTS: We developed, validated, and compared four 
      ML models to evaluate 2-year survival using RWD. Our research showed encouraging 
      outcomes, achieving an AUC of more than 80% and an estimated accuracy of over 74% 
      across the four ML models. The random forest model exhibited the highest 
      performance in predicting 2-year survival with an AUC of 0.85. Local 
      interpretable model-agnostic explanations was used to explain individual 
      predictions and provide trust and insights into the clinical implications of the 
      ML model. CONCLUSION: With this proof-of-concept, we integrated RWD into 
      predictive modeling using ML techniques to predict clinical outcomes and explore 
      their potential implications for clinical decision making. The potential of XAI 
      was demonstrated to enhance trust and improve the usability of the model in 
      clinical settings. Further research, including foundation modeling and generative 
      AI, will likely increase the predictive power of prognostic and predictive ML 
      models in advanced melanoma.

TI  - Trust in Artificial Intelligence-Based Clinical Decision Support Systems Among 
      Health Care Workers: Systematic Review.
PG  - e69678
LID - 10.2196/69678 [doi]
LID - e69678
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence-based clinical decision support systems 
      (AI-CDSSs) have enhanced personalized medicine and improved the efficiency of 
      health care workers. Despite these opportunities, trust in these tools remains a 
      critical factor for their successful integration into practice. Existing research 
      lacks synthesized insights and actionable recommendations to guide the 
      development of AI-CDSSs that foster trust among health care workers. OBJECTIVE: 
      This systematic review aims to identify and synthesize key factors that influence 
      health care workers' trust in AI-CDSSs and to provide actionable recommendations 
      for enhancing their trust in these systems. METHODS: We conducted a systematic 
      review of published studies from January 2020 to November 2024, retrieved from 
      PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Inclusion criteria focused on studies that 
      examined health care workers' perceptions, experiences, and trust in AI-CDSSs. 
      Studies in non-English languages and those unrelated to health care settings were 
      excluded. Two independent reviewers followed the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook 
      and PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 
      2020 guidelines. Analysis was conducted using a developed data charter. The 
      Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool was applied to assess the quality of the 
      included studies and to evaluate the risk of bias, ensuring a rigorous and 
      systematic review process. RESULTS: A total of 27 studies met the inclusion 
      criteria, involving diverse health care workers, predominantly in hospitalized 
      settings. Qualitative methods were the most common (n=16, 59%), with sample sizes 
      ranging from small focus groups to cohorts of over 1000 participants. Eight key 
      themes emerged as pivotal in improving health care workers' trust in AI-CDSSs: 
      (1) System Transparency, emphasizing the need for clear and interpretable AI; (2) 
      Training and Familiarity, highlighting the importance of knowledge sharing and 
      user education; (3) System Usability, focusing on effective integration into 
      clinical workflows; (4) Clinical Reliability, addressing the consistency and 
      accuracy of system performance; (5) Credibility and Validation, referring to how 
      well the system performs across diverse clinical contexts; (6) Ethical 
      Consideration, examining medicolegal liability, fairness, and adherence to 
      ethical standards;(7) Human Centric Design, pioritizing patient centered 
      approaches; (8) Customization and Control, highlighting the need to tailor tools 
      to specific clinical needs while preserving health care providers' 
      decision-making autonomy. Barriers to trust included algorithmic opacity, 
      insufficient training, and ethical challenges, while enabling factors for health 
      care workers' trust in AI-CDSS tools were transparency, usability, and clinical 
      reliability. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the need for explainable AI 
      models, comprehensive training, stakeholder involvement, and human-centered 
      design to foster health care workers' trust in AI-CDSSs. Although the 
      heterogeneity of study designs and lack of specific data limit further analysis, 
      this review bridges existing gaps by identifying key themes that support trust in 
      AI-CDSSs. It also recommends that future research include diverse demographics, 
      cross-cultural perspectives, and contextual differences in trust across various 
      health care professions.

AB  - DNA methylation (DNAm) has emerged as a powerful and dynamic biomarker for 
      predicting health outcomes, biological aging, and disease risk. Unlike static 
      genetic variants, DNAm is dynamic and influenced by environmental, lifestyle, and 
      pathological factors, making it highly suitable for applications in personalized 
      medicine. This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of recent advances in 
      DNAm-based predictors, including epigenetic clocks, exposure biomarkers, disease 
      risk models, and trait-specific estimators. We describe the diverse 
      methodological frameworks underpinning these predictors, such as penalized 
      regression, surrogate modeling and deep learning. We discuss their performance 
      across various preprocessing strategies and study populations. Additionally, we 
      highlight clinical and research applications, ethical considerations, and 
      emerging challenges, such as issues of reproducibility, tissue specificity, 
      population generalizability, and interpretability. Looking forward, we explore 
      future directions emphasizing artificial intelligence, multiomics integration, 
      and longitudinal modeling. By critically assessing current limitations and 
      technological innovations, this review outlines a roadmap for advancing the 
      development, validation, and responsible implementation of DNAm-based health 
      predictors.

TI  - Utilizing Feature Selection Techniques for AI-Driven Tumor Subtype 
      Classification: Enhancing Precision in Cancer Diagnostics.
LID - 10.3390/biom15010081 [doi]
LID - 81
AB  - Cancer's heterogeneity presents significant challenges in accurate diagnosis and 
      effective treatment, including the complexity of identifying tumor subtypes and 
      their diverse biological behaviors. This review examines how feature selection 
      techniques address these challenges by improving the interpretability and 
      performance of machine learning (ML) models in high-dimensional datasets. Feature 
      selection methods-such as filter, wrapper, and embedded techniques-play a 
      critical role in enhancing the precision of cancer diagnostics by identifying 
      relevant biomarkers. The integration of multi-omics data and ML algorithms 
      facilitates a more comprehensive understanding of tumor heterogeneity, advancing 
      both diagnostics and personalized therapies. However, challenges such as ensuring 
      data quality, mitigating overfitting, and addressing scalability remain critical 
      limitations of these methods. Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered feature 
      selection offers promising solutions to these issues by automating and refining 
      the feature extraction process. This review highlights the transformative 
      potential of these approaches while emphasizing future directions, including the 
      incorporation of deep learning (DL) models and integrative multi-omics strategies 
      for more robust and reproducible findings.

TI  - Federated unsupervised random forest for privacy-preserving patient 
      stratification.
PG  - ii198-ii207
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btae382 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: In the realm of precision medicine, effective patient stratification 
      and disease subtyping demand innovative methodologies tailored for multi-omics 
      data. Clustering techniques applied to multi-omics data have become instrumental 
      in identifying distinct subgroups of patients, enabling a finer-grained 
      understanding of disease variability. Meanwhile, clinical datasets are often 
      small and must be aggregated from multiple hospitals. Online data sharing, 
      however, is seen as a significant challenge due to privacy concerns, potentially 
      impeding big data's role in medical advancements using machine learning. This 
      work establishes a powerful framework for advancing precision medicine through 
      unsupervised random forest-based clustering in combination with federated 
      computing. RESULTS: We introduce a novel multi-omics clustering approach 
      utilizing unsupervised random forests. The unsupervised nature of the random 
      forest enables the determination of cluster-specific feature importance, 
      unraveling key molecular contributors to distinct patient groups. Our methodology 
      is designed for federated execution, a crucial aspect in the medical domain where 
      privacy concerns are paramount. We have validated our approach on machine 
      learning benchmark datasets as well as on cancer data from The Cancer Genome 
      Atlas. Our method is competitive with the state-of-the-art in terms of disease 
      subtyping, but at the same time substantially improves the cluster 
      interpretability. Experiments indicate that local clustering performance can be 
      improved through federated computing. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The 
      proposed methods are available as an R-package 
      (https://github.com/pievos101/uRF).

TI  - Global trends in machine learning applications for single-cell transcriptomics 
      research.
PG  - 164

AB  - BACKGROUND: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized cellular 
      heterogeneity analysis by decoding gene expression profiles at individual cell 
      level, while machine learning (ML) has emerged as core computational tool for 
      clustering analysis, dimensionality reduction modeling and developmental 
      trajectory inference in single-cell transcriptomics(SCT). Although 3,307 papers 
      have been published in past two decades, there remains lack of bibliometric 
      review comprehensively addressing methodological evolution, technical challenges 
      and clinical translation pathways. This study aims to fill research gap through 
      bibliometric and visual analysis, revealing technological evolution trends and 
      future development directions. METHODS: Using 3,307 publications from Web of 
      Science Core Collection(WOSCC), we conducted bibliometric and visualization 
      analysis through CiteSpace and VOSviewer to systematically review research 
      trends, national/institutional contributions, keyword co-occurrence networks and 
      co-citation relationships. Data screening strictly limited to English articles 
      and reviews, excluding irrelevant document types, focusing on core application 
      scenarios of ML in SCT. RESULTS: China and United States dominated research 
      output (combined 65%), with China leading in publication volume (54.8%) while US 
      demonstrating academic influence through H-index 84 and 37,135 total citations. 
      Research hotspots concentrated on random forest (RF) and deep learning models, 
      showing transition from algorithm development to clinical applications (e.g., 
      tumor immune microenvironment analysis). Chinese Academy of Sciences and Harvard 
      University emerged as core collaboration hubs, with international cooperation 
      network primarily featuring US-China collaboration. Keyword clustering revealed 
      four themes: gene expression, immunotherapy, bioinformatics, and 
      inflammation-related research. Technical bottlenecks included data heterogeneity, 
      insufficient model interpretability and weak cross-dataset generalization 
      capability. CONCLUSION: ML-scRNA-seq integration has advanced cellular 
      heterogeneity analysis and precision medicine development. Future directions 
      should optimize deep learning architectures, enhance model generalization 
      capabilities, and promote technical translation through multi-omics and clinical 
      data integration. Interdisciplinary collaboration represents key to overcoming 
      current limitations (e.g., data standardization, algorithm interpretability), 
      ultimately realizing deep integration between single-cell technologies and 
      precision medicine.

      accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, AI accelerates diagnostics and predictive 
      modeling, enabling more effective decision-making in treatment planning and 
      improving long-term clinical outcomes. Required standardized, updated protocols 
      significantly improve transparency and reproducibility and effectively bridge the 
      gap between preclinical research and clinical application, ensuring consistent 
      validation and translation of AI-driven innovations. By integrating computational 
      intelligence with regenerative medicine, AI is paving the way for personalized 
      and efficient solutions in CMF bone reconstruction, offering transformative 
      advancements in patient care and shaping the future of precision medicine in 
      regenerative therapies.

AB  - Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) can capture the spatial patterns of 
      brain atrophy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and incipient dementia. Recently, many 
      sMRI-based deep learning methods have been developed for AD diagnosis. Some of 
      these methods utilize neural networks to extract high-level representations on 
      the basis of handcrafted features, while others attempt to learn useful features 
      from brain regions proposed by a separate module. However, these methods require 
      considerable manual engineering. Their stepwise training procedures would 
      introduce cascading errors. Here, we propose the parallel attention-augmented 
      bilinear network, a novel deep learning framework for AD diagnosis. Based on a 3D 
      convolutional neural network, the framework directly learns both global and local 
      features from sMRI scans without any prior knowledge. The framework is 
      lightweight and suitable for end-to-end training. We evaluate the framework on 
      two public datasets (ADNI-1 and ADNI-2) containing 1,340 subjects. On both the AD 
      classification and mild cognitive impairment conversion prediction tasks, our 
      framework achieves competitive results. Furthermore, we generate heat maps that 
      highlight discriminative areas for visual interpretation. Experiments demonstrate 
      the effectiveness of the proposed framework when medical priors are unavailable 
      or the computing resources are limited. The proposed framework is general for 3D 
      medical image analysis with both efficiency and interpretability.

AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a primary global health concern, and identifying the 
      molecular pathways, genetic subtypes, and mutations associated with CRC is 
      crucial for precision medicine. However, traditional measurement techniques such 
      as gene sequencing are costly and time-consuming, while most deep learning 
      methods proposed for this task lack interpretability. This study offers a new 
      approach to enhance the state-of-the-art deep learning methods for molecular 
      pathways and key mutation prediction by incorporating cell network information. 
      We build cell graphs with nuclei as nodes and nuclei connections as edges of the 
      network and leverage Social Network Analysis (SNA) measures to extract abstract, 
      perceivable, and interpretable features that explicitly describe the cell network 
      characteristics in an image. Our approach does not rely on precise nuclei 
      segmentation or feature extraction, is computationally efficient, and is easily 
      scalable. In this study, we utilize the TCGA-CRC-DX dataset, comprising 499 
      patients and 502 diagnostic slides from primary colorectal tumours, sourced from 
      36 distinct medical centres in the United States. By incorporating the SNA 
      features alongside deep features in two multiple instance learning frameworks, we 
      demonstrate improved performance for chromosomal instability (CIN), hypermutated 
      tumour (HM), TP53 gene, BRAF gene, and Microsatellite instability (MSI) status 
      prediction tasks (2.4%-4% and 7-8.8% improvement in AUROC and AUPRC on average). 
      Additionally, our method achieves outstanding performance on MSI prediction in an 
      external PAIP dataset (99% AUROC and 98% AUPRC), demonstrating its 
      generalizability. Our findings highlight the discrimination power of SNA features 
      and how they can be beneficial to deep learning models' performance and provide 
      insights into the correlation of cell network profiles with molecular pathways 
      and key mutations.

TI  - A Knowledge-Enhanced Platform (MetaSepsisKnowHub) for Retrieval Augmented 
      Generation-Based Sepsis Heterogeneity and Personalized Management: Development 
      Study.
PG  - e67201
LID - 10.2196/67201 [doi]
LID - e67201
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a severe syndrome of organ dysfunction caused by infection; 
      it has high heterogeneity and high in-hospital mortality, representing a grim 
      clinical challenge for precision medicine in critical care. OBJECTIVE: We aimed 
      to extract reported sepsis biomarkers to provide users with comprehensive 
      biomedical information and integrate retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and 
      prompt engineering to enhance the accuracy, stability, and interpretability of 
      clinical decisions recommended by large language models (LLMs). METHODS: To 
      address the challenge, we established and updated the first knowledge-enhanced 
      platform, MetaSepsisKnowHub, comprising 427 sepsis biomarkers and 423 studies, 
      aiming to systematically collect and annotate sepsis biomarkers to guide 
      personalized clinical decision-making in the diagnosis and treatment of human 
      sepsis. We curated a tailored LLM framework incorporating RAG and prompt 
      engineering and incorporated 2 performance evaluation scales: the System 
      Usability Scale and the Net Promoter Score. RESULTS: The overall quantitative 
      ratings of expert-reviewed clinical recommendations based on RAG surpassed 
      baseline responses generated by 4 LLMs and showed a statistically significant 
      improvement in textual questions (GPT-4: mean 75.79, SD 7.11 vs mean 81.59, SD 
      9.87; P=.02; GPT-4o: mean 70.36, SD 7.63 vs mean 77.98, SD 13.26; P=.02; 
      Qwen2.5-instruct: mean 77.08 SD 3.75 vs mean 85.46, SD 7.27; P<.001; and 
      DeepSeek-R1: mean 77.67, SD 3.66 vs mean 86.42, SD 8.56; P<.001), but no 
      significant statistical differences could be measured in clinical scenarios. The 
      RAG assessment score comparing RAG-based responses and expert-provided benchmark 
      answers illustrated prominent factual correctness, accuracy, and knowledge recall 
      compared to the baseline responses. After use, the average the System Usability 
      Scale score was 82.20 (SD 14.17) and the Net Promoter Score was 72, demonstrating 
      high user satisfaction and loyalty. CONCLUSIONS: We highlight the pioneering 
      MetaSepsisKnowHub platform, and we show that combining MetaSepsisKnowHub with RAG 
      can minimize limitations on precision and maximize the breadth of LLMs to shorten 
      the bench-to-bedside distance, serving as a knowledge-enhanced paradigm for 
      future application of artificial intelligence in critical care medicine.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a heterogeneous condition; 
      multiple underlying neurobiological and behavioral substrates are associated with 
      treatment response variability. Understanding the sources of this variability and 
      predicting outcomes has been elusive. Machine learning (ML) shows promise in 
      predicting treatment response in MDD, but its application is limited by 
      challenges to the clinical interpretability of ML models, and clinicians often 
      lack confidence in model results. In order to improve the interpretability of ML 
      models in clinical practice, our goal was to demonstrate the derivation of 
      treatment-relevant patient profiles comprised of clinical and demographic 
      information using a novel ML approach. METHODS: We analyzed data from six 
      clinical trials of pharmacological treatment for depression (total n = 5438) 
      using the Differential Prototypes Neural Network (DPNN), a ML model that derives 
      patient prototypes which can be used to derive treatment-relevant patient 
      clusters while learning to generate probabilities for differential treatment 
      response. A model classifying remission and outputting individual remission 
      probabilities for five first-line monotherapies and three combination treatments 
      was trained using clinical and demographic data. Prototypes were evaluated for 
      interpretability by assessing differences in feature distributions (e.g. age, 
      sex, symptom severity) and treatment-specific outcomes. RESULTS: A 3-prototype 
      model achieved an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.66 and an expected 
      absolute improvement in remission rate for those receiving the best predicted 
      treatment of 6.5% (relative improvement of 15.6%) compared to the population 
      remission rate. We identified three treatment-relevant patient clusters. Cluster 
      A patients tended to be younger, to have increased levels of fatigue, and more 
      severe symptoms. Cluster B patients tended to be older, female, have less severe 
      symptoms, and the highest remission rates. Cluster C patients had more severe 
      symptoms, lower remission rates, more psychomotor agitation, more intense 
      suicidal ideation, and more somatic genital symptoms. CONCLUSION: It is possible 
      to produce novel treatment-relevant patient profiles using ML models; doing so 
      may improve interpretability of ML models and the quality of precision medicine 
      treatments for MDD.

AB  - Breast cancer (BrCa), being one of the most prevalent forms of cancer in women, 
      poses many challenges in the field of treatment and diagnosis due to its complex 
      biological mechanisms. Early and accurate diagnosis plays a fundamental role in 
      improving survival rates, but the limitations of existing imaging methods and 
      clinical data interpretation often prevent optimal results. Large Language Models 
      (LLMs), which are developed based on advanced architectures such as transformers, 
      have brought about a significant revolution in data processing and medical 
      decision-making. By analyzing a large volume of medical and clinical data, these 
      models enable early diagnosis by identifying patterns in images and medical 
      records and provide personalized treatment strategies by integrating genetic 
      markers and clinical guidelines. Despite the transformative potential of these 
      models, their use in BrCa management faces challenges such as data sensitivity, 
      algorithm transparency, ethical considerations, and model compatibility with the 
      details of medical applications that need to be addressed to achieve reliable 
      results. This review systematically reviews the impact of LLMs on BrCa treatment 
      and diagnosis. This study's objectives include analyzing the role of LLM 
      technology in diagnosing and treating this disease. The findings indicate that 
      the application of LLMs has resulted in significant improvements in various 
      aspects of BrCa management, such as a 35% increase in the Efficiency of Diagnosis 
      and BrCa Treatment (EDBC), a 30% enhancement in the System's Clinical Trust and 
      Reliability (SCTR), and a 20% improvement in the quality of patient education and 
      information (IPEI). Ultimately, this study demonstrates the importance of LLMs in 
      advancing precision medicine for BrCa and paves the way for effective 
      patient-centered care solutions.

AB  - Glioblastoma is among the most aggressive brain tumors in adults, characterized 
      by patient-specific invasion patterns driven by the underlying brain 
      microstructure. In this work, we present a proof-of-concept for a mathematical 
      model of GBL growth, enabling real-time prediction and patient-specific parameter 
      identification from longitudinal neuroimaging data. The framework exploits a 
      diffuse-interface mathematical model to describe the tumor evolution and a 
      reduced-order modeling strategy, relying on proper orthogonal decomposition, 
      trained on synthetic data derived from patient-specific brain anatomies 
      reconstructed from magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging. A 
      neural network surrogate learns the inverse mapping from tumor evolution to model 
      parameters, achieving significant computational speed-up while preserving high 
      accuracy. To ensure robustness and interpretability, we perform both global and 
      local sensitivity analyses, identifying the key biophysical parameters governing 
      tumor dynamics and assessing the stability of the inverse problem solution. These 
      results establish a methodological foundation for future clinical deployment of 
      patient-specific digital twins in neuro-oncology.

TI  - Predicting intraoperative blood loss risk in severe lumbar disc herniation 
      patients undergoing PLIF: a multicenter cohort study using ensemble learning.
PG  - 5904-5913
LID - 10.1097/JS9.0000000000002730 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with severe lumbar disc herniation (LDH), particularly those 
      complicated by spinal stenosis or vertebral instability, frequently require 
      posterior lumbar interbody fusion to alleviate nerve compression and reconstruct 
      spinal biomechanical stability. Aiming to optimize individualized surgical 
      planning, it is necessary to establish accurate predictive models derived from 
      multidimensional clinical data. METHODS: In this retrospective, multi-center 
      study, the data utilized in this study were sourced from the Degenerative Spine 
      Diseases in China (DSDC2024, NCT05867732). The model was trained on 3055 cases 
      and externally validated across four geographically distinct cohorts ( n = 3186). 
      Leveraging a two-stage ensemble framework, we first applied Lasso regression to 
      select target predictive variables from 38 clinical accessibility features 
      (demographics, comorbidities, surgical parameters, and laboratory indices), then 
      integrated XGBoost, random forest, and logistic regression through stacked 
      generalization. Bayesian optimization with 10-fold cross-validation refined 
      hyperparameters, while decision curve analysis quantified clinical utility 
      against traditional risk assessment methods. Shapley Additive exPlanations 
      analysis quantified feature contributions and interaction effects. RESULTS: 
      Amongst the 70 algorithmic combinations evaluated, the integration of Lasso with 
      Stack emerged as the most predictive, achieving an impressive average area under 
      the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.884. The top five significant 
      predictors were the fusion levels, clinical course duration, preoperative 
      hospitalization, preoperative hemoglobin, and preoperative albumin. CONCLUSION: 
      The IBLED-LDH model provides a valuable tool for preoperative intraoperative 
      blood loss risk stratification, balancing predictive accuracy with 
      interpretability through advanced ensemble learning.

TI  - FIT calculator: a multi-risk prediction framework for medical outcomes using 
      cardiorespiratory fitness data.

AB  - Accurately predicting patients' risk for specific medical outcomes is paramount 
      for effective healthcare management and personalized medicine. While a 
      substantial body of literature addresses the prediction of diverse medical 
      conditions, existing models predominantly focus on singular outcomes, limiting 
      their scope to one disease at a time. However, clinical reality often entails 
      patients concurrently facing multiple health risks across various medical 
      domains. In response to this gap, our study proposes a novel multi-risk framework 
      adept at simultaneous risk prediction for multiple clinical outcomes, including 
      diabetes, mortality, and hypertension. Leveraging a concise set of features 
      extracted from patients' cardiorespiratory fitness data, our framework minimizes 
      computational complexity while maximizing predictive accuracy. Moreover, we 
      integrate a state-of-the-art instance-based interpretability technique into our 
      framework, providing users with comprehensive explanations for each prediction. 
      These explanations afford medical practitioners invaluable insights into the 
      primary health factors influencing individual predictions, fostering greater 
      trust and utility in the underlying prediction models. Our approach thus stands 
      to significantly enhance healthcare decision-making processes, facilitating more 
      targeted interventions and improving patient outcomes in clinical practice. Our 
      prediction framework utilizes an automated machine learning framework, Auto-Weka, 
      to optimize machine learning models and hyper-parameter configurations for the 
      simultaneous prediction of three medical outcomes: diabetes, mortality, and 
      hypertension. Additionally, we employ a local interpretability technique to 
      elucidate predictions generated by our framework. These explanations manifest 
      visually, highlighting key attributes contributing to each instance's prediction 
      for enhanced interpretability. Using automated machine learning techniques, the 
      models simultaneously predict hypertension, mortality, and diabetes risks, 
      utilizing only nine patient features. They achieved an average AUC of 
      0.90 ± 0.001 on the hypertension dataset, 0.90 ± 0.002 on the mortality dataset, 
      and 0.89 ± 0.001 on the diabetes dataset through tenfold cross-validation. 
      Additionally, the models demonstrated strong performance with an average AUC of 
      0.89 ± 0.001 on the hypertension dataset, 0.90 ± 0.001 on the mortality dataset, 
      and 0.89 ± 0.001 on the diabetes dataset using bootstrap evaluation with 1000 
      resamples.

TI  - A Multi-Stage Approach for Cardiovascular Risk Assessment from Retinal Images 
      Using an Amalgamation of Deep Learning and Computer Vision Techniques.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics14090928 [doi]
LID - 928
AB  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Early 
      detection and effective risk assessment are crucial for implementing preventive 
      measures and improving patient outcomes for CVDs. This work presents a novel 
      approach to CVD risk assessment using fundus images, leveraging the inherent 
      connection between retinal microvascular changes and systemic vascular health. 
      This study aims to develop a predictive model for the early detection of CVDs by 
      evaluating retinal vascular parameters. This methodology integrates both 
      handcrafted features derived through mathematical computation and retinal 
      vascular patterns extracted by artificial intelligence (AI) models. By combining 
      these approaches, we seek to enhance the accuracy and reliability of CVD risk 
      prediction in individuals. The methodology integrates state-of-the-art computer 
      vision algorithms and AI techniques in a multi-stage architecture to extract 
      relevant features from retinal fundus images. These features encompass a range of 
      vascular parameters, including vessel caliber, tortuosity, and branching 
      patterns. Additionally, a deep learning (DL)-based binary classification model is 
      incorporated to enhance predictive accuracy. A dataset comprising fundus images 
      and comprehensive metadata from the clinical trials conducted is utilized for 
      training and validation. The proposed approach demonstrates promising results in 
      the early prediction of CVD risk factors. The interpretability of the approach is 
      enhanced through visualization techniques that highlight the regions of interest 
      within the fundus images that are contributing to the risk predictions. 
      Furthermore, the validation conducted in the clinical trials and the performance 
      analysis of the proposed approach shows the potential to provide early and 
      accurate predictions. The proposed system not only aids in risk stratification 
      but also serves as a valuable tool for identifying vascular abnormalities that 
      may precede overt cardiovascular events. The approach has achieved an accuracy of 
      85% and the findings of this study underscore the feasibility and efficacy of 
      leveraging fundus images for cardiovascular risk assessment. As a non-invasive 
      and cost-effective modality, fundus image analysis presents a scalable solution 
      for population-wide screening programs. This research contributes to the evolving 
      landscape of precision medicine by providing an innovative tool for proactive 
      cardiovascular health management. Future work will focus on refining the 
      solution's robustness, exploring additional risk factors, and validating its 
      performance in additional and diverse clinical settings.

TI  - Qualitative Evaluation of an Artificial Intelligence-Based Clinical Decision 
      Support System to Guide Rhythm Management of Atrial Fibrillation: Survey Study.
PG  - e36443
LID - 10.2196/36443 [doi]
LID - e36443
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the numerous studies evaluating various rhythm control 
      strategies for atrial fibrillation (AF), determination of the optimal strategy in 
      a single patient is often based on trial and error, with no one-size-fits-all 
      approach based on international guidelines/recommendations. The decision, 
      therefore, remains personal and lends itself well to help from a clinical 
      decision support system, specifically one guided by artificial intelligence (AI). 
      QRhythm utilizes a 2-stage machine learning (ML) model to identify the optimal 
      rhythm management strategy in a given patient based on a set of clinical factors, 
      in which the model first uses supervised learning to predict the actions of an 
      expert clinician and identifies the best strategy through reinforcement learning 
      to obtain the best clinical outcome-a composite of symptomatic recurrence, 
      hospitalization, and stroke. OBJECTIVE: We qualitatively evaluated a novel, 
      AI-based, clinical decision support system (CDSS) for AF rhythm management, 
      called QRhythm, which uses both supervised and reinforcement learning to 
      recommend either a rate control or one of 3 types of rhythm control 
      strategies-external cardioversion, antiarrhythmic medication, or ablation-based 
      on individual patient characteristics. METHODS: Thirty-three clinicians, 
      including cardiology attendings and fellows and internal medicine attendings and 
      residents, performed an assessment of QRhythm, followed by a survey to assess 
      relative comfort with automated CDSS in rhythm management and to examine areas 
      for future development. RESULTS: The 33 providers were surveyed with training 
      levels ranging from resident to fellow to attending. Of the characteristics of 
      the app surveyed, safety was most important to providers, with an average 
      importance rating of 4.7 out of 5 (SD 0.72). This priority was followed by 
      clinical integrity (a desire for the advice provided to make clinical sense; 
      importance rating 4.5, SD 0.9), backward interpretability (transparency in the 
      population used to create the algorithm; importance rating 4.3, SD 0.65), 
      transparency of the algorithm (reasoning underlying the decisions made; 
      importance rating 4.3, SD 0.88), and provider autonomy (the ability to challenge 
      the decisions made by the model; importance rating 3.85, SD 0.83). Providers who 
      used the app ranked the integrity of recommendations as their highest concern 
      with ongoing clinical use of the model, followed by efficacy of the application 
      and patient data security. Trust in the app varied; 1 (17%) provider responded 
      that they somewhat disagreed with the statement, "I trust the recommendations 
      provided by the QRhythm app," 2 (33%) providers responded with neutrality to the 
      statement, and 3 (50%) somewhat agreed with the statement. CONCLUSIONS: Safety of 
      ML applications was the highest priority of the providers surveyed, and trust of 
      such models remains varied. Widespread clinical acceptance of ML in health care 
      is dependent on how much providers trust the algorithms. Building this trust 
      involves ensuring transparency and interpretability of the model.

TI  - AI-based CT assessment of sarcopenia in borderline resectable pancreatic Cancer: 
      A narrative review of clinical and technical perspectives.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia, defined as the progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass 
      and function, has been associated with poor prognosis in patients with pancreatic 
      cancer, particularly those with borderline resectable pancreatic cancer (BRPC). 
      Although body composition can be extracted from routine CT imaging, sarcopenia 
      assessment remains underused in clinical practice. Recent advances in artificial 
      intelligence (AI) offer the potential to automate and standardize this process, 
      but their clinical translation remains limited. This narrative review aims to 
      critically evaluate (1) the clinical impact of CT-defined sarcopenia in BRPC, and 
      (2) the performance and maturity of AI-based methods for automated muscle and fat 
      segmentation on CT images. METHODS: A dual-axis literature search was conducted 
      to identify clinical studies assessing the prognostic role of sarcopenia in BRPC, 
      and technical studies developing AI-based segmentation models for body 
      composition analysis. Structured data extraction was applied to 13 clinical and 
      71 technical studies. A PRISMA-inspired flow diagram was included to ensure 
      methodological transparency. RESULTS: Sarcopenia was consistently associated with 
      worse survival and treatment tolerance in BRPC, yet clinical definitions and 
      cut-offs varied widely. AI models-mostly 2D U-Nets trained on L3-level CT 
      slices-achieved high segmentation accuracy (mean DSC >0.93), but external 
      validation and standardization were often lacking. CONCLUSION: CT-based AI 
      assessment of sarcopenia holds promise for improving patient stratification in 
      BRPC. However, its clinical adoption will require standardization, integration 
      into decision-support frameworks, and prospective validation across diverse 
      populations.

AB  - The increasing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare not only 
      holds the potential for efficiency gains, personalized medicine, and 
      evidence-based decisions but also raises ethical and social challenges, such as 
      bias, lack of transparency, and acceptance. Participatory approaches that 
      actively involve patients, physicians, caregivers, and other stakeholders in the 
      development process make it possible to align technological innovations with 
      actual needs and to design them in a socially just way.The analysis distinguishes 
      between participation as active co-design and partaking as access to social 
      resources. Theoretical models such as the "ladder of participation" (Arnstein) 
      illustrate the different levels of participation. In addition, methodological 
      approaches such as action research, community-based participatory research, 
      ethics by design, and value-sensitive design are discussed, which promote early 
      ethical reflection and continuous user feedback.Practical examples such as KIPA 
      (AI-supported patient information), KIDELIR (delirium prevention in care), and 
      PRIVETDIS (neurotechnologies and mental privacy) show how participatory research 
      can contribute to the optimization of care concepts. In addition to opportunities 
      such as increased acceptance and user-centered technology design, challenges are 
      identified, including limited resources, lack of representativeness, and 
      invisible additional burdens for those involved. Finally, it is emphasized that 
      in addition to technical and regulatory measures, continuous ethical reflection 
      and transparent communication are essential to implement trustworthy and 
      effective AI systems in healthcare.

TI  - TranSynergy: Mechanism-driven interpretable deep neural network for the 
      synergistic prediction and pathway deconvolution of drug combinations.

AB  - Drug combinations have demonstrated great potential in cancer treatments. They 
      alleviate drug resistance and improve therapeutic efficacy. The fast-growing 
      number of anti-cancer drugs has caused the experimental investigation of all drug 
      combinations to become costly and time-consuming. Computational techniques can 
      improve the efficiency of drug combination screening. Despite recent advances in 
      applying machine learning to synergistic drug combination prediction, several 
      challenges remain. First, the performance of existing methods is suboptimal. 
      There is still much space for improvement. Second, biological knowledge has not 
      been fully incorporated into the model. Finally, many models are lack 
      interpretability, limiting their clinical applications. To address these 
      challenges, we have developed a knowledge-enabled and self-attention transformer 
      boosted deep learning model, TranSynergy, which improves the performance and 
      interpretability of synergistic drug combination prediction. TranSynergy is 
      designed so that the cellular effect of drug actions can be explicitly modeled 
      through cell-line gene dependency, gene-gene interaction, and genome-wide 
      drug-target interaction. A novel Shapley Additive Gene Set Enrichment Analysis 
      (SA-GSEA) method has been developed to deconvolute genes that contribute to the 
      synergistic drug combination and improve model interpretability. Extensive 
      benchmark studies demonstrate that TranSynergy outperforms the state-of-the-art 
      method, suggesting the potential of mechanism-driven machine learning. Novel 
      pathways that are associated with the synergistic combinations are revealed and 
      supported by experimental evidences. They may provide new insights into 
      identifying biomarkers for precision medicine and discovering new anti-cancer 
      therapies. Several new synergistic drug combinations have been predicted with 
      high confidence for ovarian cancer which has few treatment options. The code is 
      available at https://github.com/qiaoliuhub/drug_combination.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Data-Driven Decision Making (DDDM) plays a pivotal role in 
      healthcare, specifically patient management. This review aims to provide a 
      comprehensive understanding of the technologies used in DDDM and provide a 
      framework of how DDDM is involved in patient management. METHODOLOGY: This study 
      follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis 
      Protocols (PRISMA-P) framework, studies from Web of Science, Pubmed, and Embase 
      are screened for consideration. The inclusion criteria are outlined to identify 
      studies on patient management utilizing DDDM. RESULT: The studies included in the 
      review explore DDDM in patient management from data-driven approaches to decision 
      making methods. In the former, artificial intelligence, together with other 
      methods, is the dominant method utilized. As a comparison, the decision support 
      system, Markov decision process, and shared decision making are exploited in the 
      latter. Disease diagnosis and treatment was the most common area of patient 
      management application along with precision medicine, patient care, nursing, and 
      other related fields of patient management. A framework of how DDDM is involved 
      in patient management was identified. CONCLUSION: While challenges such as data 
      quality and interpretability exist, advantages of DDDM lie in unprecedented 
      personalization, streamlined decision-making, and the potential for a future 
      where technology complements healthcare expertise for more effective and 
      patient-centered care. DDDM is not only a useful option for patient management 
      but also to many other aspects of healthcare and the systems around healthcare.

TI  - A personalized approach to understanding food cravings and intake: a study 
      protocol.
PG  - 103
LID - 10.1186/s40337-025-01303-0 [doi]
LID - 103
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies on food craving and consumption often overlook the 
      interconnectedness of risk factors, assuming uniform mechanisms that drive 
      individuals to (over)consume food. This project seeks to address this gap by 
      leveraging a precision health framework to explore whether multimodal clustering 
      can predict weight and eating outcomes after six months, providing a more nuanced 
      understanding of individual variability. METHODS: The project will include a 
      longitudinal study, encompassing several sub-studies where self-report, 
      electrophysiological, and time series dynamic data will be collected at three 
      time points. At baseline, participants will complete comprehensive assessments, 
      including an electroencephalography (EEG) experiment and a one-week experience 
      sampling study (ESM). Machine learning techniques will be employed to uncover 
      distinct participant clusters, characterized by unique patterns of food 
      consumption and weight changes over six months. Markers that best differentiate 
      these profiles will be identified with explainable AI techniques, which aim to 
      make machine learning model outputs understandable by highlighting the key 
      features or patterns driving predictions, enabling personalized insights into key 
      factors contributing to eating behaviors and weight management. DISCUSSION: By 
      exploring the variability of mechanisms influencing food consumption, eating 
      regulation, and weight gain, we aim to uncover subgroups of individuals who are 
      most affected by specific influences, such as stress, emotion regulation 
      difficulties, or sleep deprivation. This project will advance theoretical 
      understanding by integrating multimodal data and emphasizing idiographic methods 
      to capture individual variability. Findings will provide a foundation for future 
      research on precision approaches to eating behaviors and may offer insights into 
      personalized strategies for prevention and management of both normative and 
      disordered eating patterns.

TI  - Generating Complex Explanations for Artificial Intelligence Models: An 
      Application to Clinical Data on Severe Mental Illness.
LID - 10.3390/life14070807 [doi]
LID - 807
AB  - We present an explainable artificial intelligence methodology for predicting 
      mortality in patients. We combine clinical data from an electronic patient 
      healthcare record system with factors relevant for severe mental illness and then 
      apply machine learning. The machine learning model is used to predict mortality 
      in patients with severe mental illness. Our methodology uses class-contrastive 
      reasoning. We show how machine learning scientists can use class-contrastive 
      reasoning to generate complex explanations that explain machine model predictions 
      and data. An example of a complex class-contrastive explanation is the following: 
      "The patient is predicted to have a low probability of death because the patient 
      has self-harmed before, and was at some point on medications such as 
      first-generation and second-generation antipsychotics. There are 11 other 
      patients with these characteristics. If the patient did not have these 
      characteristics, the prediction would be different". This can be used to generate 
      new hypotheses, which can be tested in follow-up studies. Diuretics seemed to be 
      associated with a lower probability of mortality (as predicted by the machine 
      learning model) in a group of patients with cardiovascular disease. The 
      combination of delirium and dementia in Alzheimer's disease may also predispose 
      some patients towards a higher probability of predicted mortality. Our technique 
      can be employed to create intricate explanations from healthcare data and 
      possibly other areas where explainability is important. We hope this will be a 
      step towards explainable AI in personalized medicine.

TI  - Explaining decisions of graph convolutional neural networks: patient-specific 
      molecular subnetworks responsible for metastasis prediction in breast cancer.
PG  - 42
LID - 10.1186/s13073-021-00845-7 [doi]
LID - 42
AB  - BACKGROUND: Contemporary deep learning approaches show cutting-edge performance 
      in a variety of complex prediction tasks. Nonetheless, the application of deep 
      learning in healthcare remains limited since deep learning methods are often 
      considered as non-interpretable black-box models. However, the machine learning 
      community made recent elaborations on interpretability methods explaining data 
      point-specific decisions of deep learning techniques. We believe that such 
      explanations can assist the need in personalized precision medicine decisions via 
      explaining patient-specific predictions. METHODS: Layer-wise Relevance 
      Propagation (LRP) is a technique to explain decisions of deep learning methods. 
      It is widely used to interpret Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) applied on 
      image data. Recently, CNNs started to extend towards non-Euclidean domains like 
      graphs. Molecular networks are commonly represented as graphs detailing 
      interactions between molecules. Gene expression data can be assigned to the 
      vertices of these graphs. In other words, gene expression data can be structured 
      by utilizing molecular network information as prior knowledge. Graph-CNNs can be 
      applied to structured gene expression data, for example, to predict metastatic 
      events in breast cancer. Therefore, there is a need for explanations showing 
      which part of a molecular network is relevant for predicting an event, e.g., 
      distant metastasis in cancer, for each individual patient. RESULTS: We extended 
      the procedure of LRP to make it available for Graph-CNN and tested its 
      applicability on a large breast cancer dataset. We present Graph Layer-wise 
      Relevance Propagation (GLRP) as a new method to explain the decisions made by 
      Graph-CNNs. We demonstrate a sanity check of the developed GLRP on a hand-written 
      digits dataset and then apply the method on gene expression data. We show that 
      GLRP provides patient-specific molecular subnetworks that largely agree with 
      clinical knowledge and identify common as well as novel, and potentially 
      druggable, drivers of tumor progression. CONCLUSIONS: The developed method could 
      be potentially highly useful on interpreting classification results in the 
      context of different omics data and prior knowledge molecular networks on the 
      individual patient level, as for example in precision medicine approaches or a 
      molecular tumor board.

TI  - Inferring ancestry with the hierarchical soft clustering approach tangleGen.
PG  - 2244-2255
LID - 10.1101/gr.279399.124 [doi]
AB  - Understanding the genetic ancestry of populations is central to numerous 
      scientific and societal fields. It contributes to a better understanding of human 
      evolutionary history, advances personalized medicine, aids in forensic 
      identification, and allows individuals to connect to their genealogical roots. 
      Existing methods, such as ADMIXTURE, have significantly improved our ability to 
      infer ancestries. However, these methods typically work with a fixed number of 
      independent ancestral populations. As a result, they provide insight into genetic 
      admixture, but do not include a hierarchical interpretation. In particular, the 
      intricate ancestral population structures remain difficult to unravel. 
      Alternative methods with a consistent inheritance structure, such as hierarchical 
      clustering, may offer benefits in terms of interpreting the inferred ancestries. 
      Here, we present tangleGen, a soft clustering tool that transfers the 
      hierarchical machine learning framework Tangles, which leverages graph 
      theoretical concepts, to the field of population genetics. The hierarchical 
      perspective of tangleGen on the composition and structure of populations improves 
      the interpretability of the inferred ancestral relationships. Moreover, tangleGen 
      adds a new layer of explainability, as it allows identifying the 
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms that are responsible for the clustering 
      structure. We demonstrate the capabilities and benefits of tangleGen for the 
      inference of ancestral relationships, using both simulated data and data from the 
      1000 Genomes Project.

TI  - Pathformer: a biological pathway informed transformer for disease diagnosis and 
      prognosis using multi-omics data.
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btae316 [doi]
LID - btae316
AB  - MOTIVATION: Multi-omics data provide a comprehensive view of gene regulation at 
      multiple levels, which is helpful in achieving accurate diagnosis of complex 
      diseases like cancer. However, conventional integration methods rarely utilize 
      prior biological knowledge and lack interpretability. RESULTS: To integrate 
      various multi-omics data of tissue and liquid biopsies for disease diagnosis and 
      prognosis, we developed a biological pathway informed Transformer, Pathformer. It 
      embeds multi-omics input with a compacted multi-modal vector and a pathway-based 
      sparse neural network. Pathformer also leverages criss-cross attention mechanism 
      to capture the crosstalk between different pathways and modalities. We first 
      benchmarked Pathformer with 18 comparable methods on multiple cancer datasets, 
      where Pathformer outperformed all the other methods, with an average improvement 
      of 6.3%-14.7% in F1 score for cancer survival prediction, 5.1%-12% for cancer 
      stage prediction, and 8.1%-13.6% for cancer drug response prediction. 
      Subsequently, for cancer prognosis prediction based on tissue multi-omics data, 
      we used a case study to demonstrate the biological interpretability of Pathformer 
      by identifying key pathways and their biological crosstalk. Then, for cancer 
      early diagnosis based on liquid biopsy data, we used plasma and platelet datasets 
      to demonstrate Pathformer's potential of clinical applications in cancer 
      screening. Moreover, we revealed deregulation of interesting pathways (e.g. 
      scavenger receptor pathway) and their crosstalk in cancer patients' blood, 
      providing potential candidate targets for cancer microenvironment study. 
      AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Pathformer is implemented and freely available 
      at https://github.com/lulab/Pathformer.

TI  - A Multimodal Knowledge-Based Deep Learning Approach for MGMT Promoter Methylation 
      Identification.
LID - 10.3390/jimaging8120321 [doi]
LID - 321
AB  - Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is considered one of the most aggressive malignant 
      tumors, characterized by a tremendously low survival rate. Despite alkylating 
      chemotherapy being typically adopted to fight this tumor, it is known that 
      O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) enzyme repair abilities can 
      antagonize the cytotoxic effects of alkylating agents, strongly limiting tumor 
      cell destruction. However, it has been observed that MGMT promoter regions may be 
      subject to methylation, a biological process preventing MGMT enzymes from 
      removing the alkyl agents. As a consequence, the presence of the methylation 
      process in GBM patients can be considered a predictive biomarker of response to 
      therapy and a prognosis factor. Unfortunately, identifying signs of methylation 
      is a non-trivial matter, often requiring expensive, time-consuming, and invasive 
      procedures. In this work, we propose to face MGMT promoter methylation 
      identification analyzing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data using a Deep 
      Learning (DL) based approach. In particular, we propose a Convolutional Neural 
      Network (CNN) operating on suspicious regions on the FLAIR series, pre-selected 
      through an unsupervised Knowledge-Based filter leveraging both FLAIR and 
      T1-weighted series. The experiments, run on two different publicly available 
      datasets, show that the proposed approach can obtain results comparable to (and 
      in some cases better than) the considered competitor approach while consisting of 
      less than 0.29% of its parameters. Finally, we perform an eXplainable AI (XAI) 
      analysis to take a little step further toward the clinical usability of a 
      DL-based approach for MGMT promoter detection in brain MRI.

TI  - MultiCapsNet: A General Framework for Data Integration and Interpretable 
      Classification.
PG  - 767602

AB  - The latest progresses of experimental biology have generated a large number of 
      data with different formats and lengths. Deep learning is an ideal tool to deal 
      with complex datasets, but its inherent "black box" nature needs more 
      interpretability. At the same time, traditional interpretable machine learning 
      methods, such as linear regression or random forest, could only deal with 
      numerical features instead of modular features often encountered in the 
      biological field. Here, we present MultiCapsNet 
      (https://github.com/wanglf19/MultiCapsNet), a new deep learning model built on 
      CapsNet and scCapsNet, which possesses the merits such as easy data integration 
      and high model interpretability. To demonstrate the ability of this model as an 
      interpretable classifier to deal with modular inputs, we test MultiCapsNet on 
      three datasets with different data type and application scenarios. Firstly, on 
      the labeled variant call dataset, MultiCapsNet shows a similar classification 
      performance with neural network model, and provides importance scores for data 
      sources directly without an extra importance determination step required by the 
      neural network model. The importance scores generated by these two models are 
      highly correlated. Secondly, on single cell RNA sequence (scRNA-seq) dataset, 
      MultiCapsNet integrates information about protein-protein interaction (PPI), and 
      protein-DNA interaction (PDI). The classification accuracy of MultiCapsNet is 
      comparable to the neural network and random forest model. Meanwhile, MultiCapsNet 
      reveals how each transcription factor (TF) or PPI cluster node contributes to 
      classification of cell type. Thirdly, we made a comparison between MultiCapsNet 
      and SCENIC. The results show several cell type relevant TFs identified by both 
      methods, further proving the validity and interpretability of the MultiCapsNet.

AB  - This article explores the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical 
      oncology, emphasizing its impact on treatment decision-making for adult and 
      pediatric cancer care. AI applications, including advanced imaging, drug 
      discovery, and clinical decision support systems, enhance precision, 
      personalization, and efficiency. Pediatric oncology benefits from improved 
      diagnostics, risk stratification, and targeted therapies, despite unique 
      challenges. AI-driven personalized medicine optimizes treatment strategies, 
      improving patient outcomes and reducing costs. Ethical considerations, such as 
      data privacy, algorithmic bias, and explainability, remain critical for 
      responsible AI integration. Future advancements, including explainable AI and 
      quantum computing, promise to redefine cancer care through data-driven insights.

TI  - Toward Explainable Anticancer Compound Sensitivity Prediction via Multimodal 
      Attention-Based Convolutional Encoders.
PG  - 4797-4806

AB  - In line with recent advances in neural drug design and sensitivity prediction, we 
      propose a novel architecture for interpretable prediction of anticancer compound 
      sensitivity using a multimodal attention-based convolutional encoder. Our model 
      is based on the three key pillars of drug sensitivity: compounds' structure in 
      the form of a SMILES sequence, gene expression profiles of tumors, and prior 
      knowledge on intracellular interactions from protein-protein interaction 
      networks. We demonstrate that our multiscale convolutional attention-based 
      encoder significantly outperforms a baseline model trained on Morgan fingerprints 
      and a selection of encoders based on SMILES, as well as the previously reported 
      state-of-the-art for multimodal drug sensitivity prediction (R(2) = 0.86 and RMSE 
      = 0.89). Moreover, the explainability of our approach is demonstrated by a 
      thorough analysis of the attention weights. We show that the attended genes 
      significantly enrich apoptotic processes and that the drug attention is strongly 
      correlated with a standard chemical structure similarity index. Finally, we 
      report a case study of two receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitors acting on a 
      leukemia cell line, showcasing the ability of the model to focus on informative 
      genes and submolecular regions of the two compounds. The demonstrated 
      generalizability and the interpretability of our model testify to its potential 
      for in silico prediction of anticancer compound efficacy on unseen cancer cells, 
      positioning it as a valid solution for the development of personalized therapies 
      as well as for the evaluation of candidate compounds in de novo drug design.

AB  - Many studies have reported increased mortality risk in patients with Parkinson's 
      disease (PD), but few have investigated the risk factors for PD mortality, 
      including medical and socioeconomic factors. We applied an explainable artificial 
      intelligence (XAI) model to predict long-term all-cause mortality in patients 
      with PD using administrative healthcare data collected at PD diagnosis. Among 
      seven machine learning algorithms, XGBoost achieved the best performance (10-year 
      area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC): 0.836; 5-year 
      AUROC: 0.894). The most important contributing feature to PD mortality was age, 
      followed by male sex and pneumonia. Using XAI models, the nonlinear association 
      between contributing factors and PD mortality was assessed, and an optimal target 
      value to reduce mortality was found. In addition, prediction of individualized 
      10-year mortality risk for each PD participant was possible. Our XAI modeling 
      pipeline demonstrated the feasibility to predict long-term mortality in patients 
      with PD using preexisting healthcare data.

TI  - Dynamic frailty risk prediction in elderly hip replacement: a deep learning 
      approach to personalized rehabilitation.
PG  - 292
LID - 10.1186/s12911-025-03143-z [doi]
LID - 292
AB  - BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis and related degenerative conditions in the elderly 
      often necessitate hip replacement surgery. Frailty is common in this population 
      and significantly increases the risk of postoperative complications and delayed 
      recovery. Accurate prediction of postoperative frailty risk and its temporal 
      progression is essential for guiding personalized rehabilitation strategies. 
      METHODS: This study prospectively included 647 patients aged 60 years or older 
      who underwent hip replacement surgery at the Affiliated Hospital of Shanxi 
      Medical University between June 2021 and December 2023. Clinical, biochemical, 
      demographic, and surgical data were collected at preoperative and postoperative 
      stages. To mitigate sample size limitations, data augmentation was applied, 
      expanding the dataset to approximately 2,500 cases for model training. Seven 
      survival analysis models-Cox-Time, DeepHit, DeepSurv, MP-RSF, MP-AdaBoost, 
      MP-LogitR-were employed to dynamically predict frailty risk over time. Model 
      performance was evaluated using the C-index and Brier score. Model 
      interpretability was assessed using SHAP analysis. RESULTS: DeepSurv demonstrated 
      the highest predictive performance (C-index = 0.95, Brier score = 0.03), while 
      MP-RSF performed less optimally (C-index = 0.77). The predicted frailty risk 
      peaked around postoperative day 30 and declined by day 90. SHAP analysis 
      identified low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), age, body mass index 
      (BMI), and surgical indication as key contributors to frailty prediction across 
      models. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggest that the DeepSurv model 
      may more accurately predict the postoperative frailty trajectory than other 
      models. Identifying high-risk periods and key clinical predictors enables 
      clinicians to implement timely, individualized interventions that may reduce 
      frailty risk and improve functional recovery.

TI  - Enhancing convolutional neural network predictions of electrocardiograms with 
      left ventricular dysfunction using a novel sub-waveform representation.
PG  - 220-231
LID - 10.1016/j.cvdhj.2022.07.074 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Electrocardiogram (ECG) deep learning (DL) has promise to improve the 
      outcomes of patients with cardiovascular abnormalities. In ECG DL, researchers 
      often use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and traditionally use the full 
      duration of raw ECG waveforms that create redundancies in feature learning and 
      result in inaccurate predictions with large uncertainties. OBJECTIVE: For 
      enhancing these predictions, we introduced a sub-waveform representation that 
      leverages the rhythmic pattern of ECG waveforms (data-centric approach) rather 
      than changing the CNN architecture (model-centric approach). RESULTS: We applied 
      the proposed representation to a population with 92,446 patients to identify left 
      ventricular dysfunction. We found that the sub-waveform representation increases 
      the performance metrics compared to the full-waveform representation. We observed 
      a 2% increase for area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and 10% 
      increase for area under the precision-recall curve. We also carefully examined 
      three reliability components of explainability, interpretability, and fairness. 
      We provided an explanation for enhancements obtained by heartbeat alignment 
      mechanism. By developing a new scoring system, we interpreted the clinical 
      relevance of ECG features and showed that sub-waveform representation further 
      pushes the scores towards clinical predictions. Finally, we showed that the new 
      representation significantly reduces prediction uncertainties within subgroups 
      that contributes to individual fairness. CONCLUSION: We expect that this added 
      control over the granularity of ECG data will improve the DL modeling for new 
      artificial intelligence technologies in the cardiovascular space.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Root causes of disease intuitively correspond to root vertices of a 
      causal model that increase the likelihood of a diagnosis. This description of a 
      root cause nevertheless lacks the rigorous mathematical formulation needed for 
      the development of computer algorithms designed to automatically detect root 
      causes from data. We seek a definition of patient-specific root causes of disease 
      that models the intuitive procedure routinely utilized by physicians to uncover 
      root causes in the clinic. METHODS: We use structural equation models, 
      interventional counterfactuals and the recently developed mathematical 
      formalization of backtracking counterfactuals to propose a counterfactual 
      formulation of patient-specific root causes of disease matching clinical 
      intuition. RESULTS: We introduce a definition of patient-specific root causes of 
      disease that climbs to the third rung of Pearl's Ladder of Causation and matches 
      clinical intuition given factual patient data and a working causal model. We then 
      show how to assign a root causal contribution score to each variable using 
      Shapley values from explainable artificial intelligence. CONCLUSION: The proposed

AB  - Improving the drug development process can expedite the introduction of more 
      novel drugs that cater to the demands of precision medicine. Accurately 
      predicting molecular properties remains a fundamental challenge in drug discovery 
      and development. Currently, a plethora of computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) 
      methods have been widely employed in the field of molecular prediction. However, 
      most of these methods primarily analyze molecules using low-dimensional 
      representations such as SMILES notations, molecular fingerprints, and molecular 
      graph-based descriptors. Only a few approaches have focused on incorporating and 
      utilizing high-dimensional spatial structural representations of molecules. In 
      light of the advancements in artificial intelligence, we introduce a 3D 
      graph-spatial co-representation model called AEGNN-M, which combines two graph 
      neural networks, GAT and EGNN. AEGNN-M enables learning of information from both 
      molecular graphs representations and 3D spatial structural representations to 
      predict molecular properties accurately. We conducted experiments on seven public 
      datasets, three regression datasets and 14 breast cancer cell line phenotype 
      screening datasets, comparing the performance of AEGNN-M with state-of-the-art 
      deep learning methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the 
      satisfactory performance of the AEGNN-M model. Furthermore, we analyzed the 
      performance impact of different modules within AEGNN-M and the influence of 
      spatial structural representations on the model's performance. The 
      interpretability analysis also revealed the significance of specific atoms in 
      determining particular molecular properties.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a deep learning (DL) model for predicting axillary lymph 
      node (ALN) metastasis using dynamic ultrasound (US) videos in breast cancer 
      patients. METHODS: A total of 271 US videos from 271 early breast cancer patients 
      collected from Xiang'an Hospital of Xiamen University andShantou Central 
      Hospitabetween September 2019 and June 2021 were used as the training, 
      validation, and internal testing set (testing set A). Additionally, an 
      independent dataset of 49 US videos from 49 patients with breast cancer, 
      collected from Shanghai 10th Hospital of Tongji University from July 2021 to May 
      2022, was used as an external testing set (testing set B). All ALN metastases 
      were confirmed using pathological examination. Three different convolutional 
      neural networks (CNNs) with R2 + 1D, TIN, and ResNet-3D architectures were used 
      to build the models. The performance of the US video DL models was compared with 
      that of US static image DL models and axillary US examination performed by 
      ultra-sonographers. The performances of the DL models and ultra-sonographers were 
      evaluated based on accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the 
      receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Additionally, gradient class 
      activation mapping (Grad-CAM) technology was also used to enhance the 
      interpretability of the models. RESULTS: Among the three US video DL models, TIN 
      showed the best performance, achieving an AUC of 0.914 (95% CI: 0.843-0.985) in 
      predicting ALN metastasis in testing set A. The model achieved an accuracy of 
      85.25% (52/61), with a sensitivity of 76.19% (16/21) and a specificity of 90.00% 
      (36/40). The AUC of the US video DL model was superior to that of the US static 
      image DL model (0.856, 95% CI: 0.753-0.959, P<0.05). The Grad-CAM technology 
      confirmed the heatmap of the model, which highlighted important subregions of the 
      keyframe for ultra-sonographers' review. CONCLUSION: A feasible and improved DL 
      model to predict ALN metastasis from breast cancer US video images was developed. 
      The DL model in this study with reliable interpretability would provide an early 
      diagnostic strategy for the appropriate management of axillary in the early 
      breast cancer patients.

TI  - AgeNet-SHAP: An explainable AI approach for optimally mapping multivariate 
      regional brain age and clinical severity patterns in Alzheimer's disease.

LID - 10.1101/2025.02.28.25323097 [doi]
AB  - Age is a significant risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) and identifying brain age patterns is critical for 
      comprehending the normal aging and MCI/AD processes. Prior studies have widely 
      established the univariate relationships between brain regions and age, while 
      multivariate associations remain largely unexplored. Herein, various artificial 
      intelligence (AI) models were employed to perform brain age prediction using an 
      MRI dataset (n=668). Then the optimal AI model was integrated with the Shapley 
      additive explanations (SHAP) feature importance technique to identify the 
      significant multivariate brain regions involved in this prediction. Our results 
      indicated that the deep learning model (referred to as AgeNet) tremendously 
      outperformed the conventional machine learning models for brain age prediction, 
      and AgeNet integrated with SHAP (referred to as AgeNet-SHAP) identified all 
      ground-truth perturbed regions as key predictors of brain age in semi-simulation, 
      proved the validity of our methodology. In the experimental dataset, compared to 
      cognitively normal (CN) participants, MCI exhibited moderate differences in brain 
      regions, whereas AD had highly robust and widely distributed regional 
      differences. The individualized AgeNet-SHAP regional features further showed 
      associations with clinical severity scores in the AD continuum. These results 
      collectively facilitate data-driven predictive modelling approaches for disease 
      progression, diagnostics, prognostics, and personalized medicine efforts.

TI  - Methodological Review of Classification Trees for Risk Stratification: An 
      Application Example in the Obesity Paradox.
LID - 10.3390/nu17111903 [doi]
LID - 1903
AB  - BACKGROUND: Classification trees (CTs) are widely used machine learning 
      algorithms with growing applications in clinical research, especially for risk 
      stratification. Their ability to generate interpretable decision rules makes them 
      attractive to healthcare professionals. This review provides an accessible yet 
      rigorous overview of CT methodology for clinicians, highlighting their utility 
      through a case study addressing the "obesity paradox" in critically ill patients. 
      METHODS: We describe key methodological aspects of CTs, including model 
      development, pruning, validation, and classification types (simple, ensemble, and 
      hybrid). Using data from the ENPIC (Evaluation of Practical Nutrition Practices 
      in the Critical Care Patient) study, which assessed artificial nutrition in ICU 
      (intensive care unit) patients, we applied various CT approaches-CART 
      (classification and regression trees), CHAID (chi-square automatic interaction 
      detection), and XGBoost (extreme gradient boosting)-and compared them with 
      logistic regression. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanation) values were used to 
      interpret ensemble models. RESULTS: CTs allowed for identification of optimal 
      cut-off points in continuous variables and revealed complex, non-linear 
      interactions among predictors. Although the obesity paradox was not confirmed in 
      the full cohort, CTs uncovered a specific subgroup in which obesity was 
      associated with reduced mortality. The ensemble model (XGBoost) achieved the best 
      predictive performance (highest area under the ROC curve), though at the expense 
      of interpretability. CONCLUSIONS: CTs are valuable tools in clinical 
      epidemiology, complementing traditional models by uncovering hidden patterns and 
      enhancing risk stratification. While ensemble models offer superior predictive 
      accuracy, their complexity necessitates interpretability techniques such as SHAP. 
      CT-based approaches can guide personalized medicine but require cautious 
      interpretation and external validation.

AB  - Despite the outstanding performance of deep learning (DL) models, their 
      interpretability remains a challenging topic. In this study, we address the 
      transparency of DL models in medical image analysis by introducing a novel 
      interpretability method using projected gradient descent (PGD) to generate 
      adversarial examples. We use adversarial generation to analyze images. By 
      introducing perturbations that cause misclassification, we identify key features 
      influencing the model decisions. This method is tested on Brain Tumor, Eye 
      Disease, and COVID-19 datasets using six common convolutional neural networks 
      (CNN) models. We selected the top-performing models for interpretability 
      analysis. DenseNet121 achieved an AUC of 1.00 on Brain Tumor; InceptionV3, 0.99 
      on Eye Disease; and ResNet101, 1.00 on COVID-19. To test their robustness, we 
      performed an adversarial attack. The p-values from t-tests comparing original and 
      adversarial loss distributions were all < 0.05. This indicates that the 
      adversarial perturbations significantly increased the loss, confirming successful 
      adversarial generation. Our approach offers a distinct solution to bridge the gap 
      between the capabilities of artificial intelligence and its practical use in 
      clinical settings, providing a more intuitive understanding for radiologists. Our 
      code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/EAMAPG.

TI  - Development of a personalized diagnostic model for kidney stone disease tailored 
      to acute care by integrating large clinical, demographics and laboratory data: 
      the diagnostic acute care algorithm - kidney stones (DACA-KS).
PG  - 72

AB  - BACKGROUND: Kidney stone (KS) disease has high, increasing prevalence in the 
      United States and poses a massive economic burden. Diagnostics algorithms of KS 
      only use a few variables with a limited sensitivity and specificity. In this 
      study, we tested a big data approach to infer and validate a 'multi-domain' 
      personalized diagnostic acute care algorithm for KS (DACA-KS), merging 
      demographic, vital signs, clinical, and laboratory information. METHODS: We 
      utilized a large, single-center database of patients admitted to acute care units 
      in a large tertiary care hospital. Patients diagnosed with KS were compared to 
      groups of patients with acute abdominal/flank/groin pain, genitourinary diseases, 
      and other conditions. We analyzed multiple information domains (several thousands 
      of variables) using a collection of statistical and machine learning models with 
      feature selectors. We compared sensitivity, specificity and area under the 
      receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of our approach with the STONE score, 
      using cross-validation. RESULTS: Thirty eight thousand five hundred and 
      ninety-seven distinct adult patients were admitted to critical care between 2001 
      and 2012, of which 217 were diagnosed with KS, and 7446 with acute pain (non-KS). 
      The multi-domain approach using logistic regression yielded an AUROC of 0.86 and 
      a sensitivity/specificity of 0.81/0.82 in cross-validation. Increase in 
      performance was obtained by fitting a super-learner, at the price of lower 
      interpretability. We discussed in detail comorbidity and lab marker variables 
      independently associated with KS (e.g. blood chloride, candidiasis, sleep 
      disorders). CONCLUSIONS: Although external validation is warranted, DACA-KS could 
      be integrated into electronic health systems; the algorithm has the potential 
      used as an effective tool to help nurses and healthcare personnel during triage 
      or clinicians making a diagnosis, streamlining patients' management in acute 
      care.

TI  - AI-Guided Decision Support in Acute Cardiac Care: From Chest Pain to STEMI.
LID - 10.1097/CRD.0000000000001016 [doi]
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming the landscape of acute 
      cardiac care, offering novel opportunities to enhance diagnostic accuracy, risk 
      stratification, and clinical decision-making. This literature review explores the 
      current and emerging applications of AI in managing acute cardiovascular 
      conditions, including myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, and heart failure. 
      Methods such as machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing 
      have demonstrated potential in analyzing electrocardiograms, imaging, electronic 
      health records, and wearable data to support timely and individualized care. 
      Despite encouraging results from retrospective studies and pilot implementations, 
      several barriers hinder broader clinical integration. Key limitations include 
      data quality issues, lack of model transparency, clinician skepticism, regulatory 
      uncertainties, and concerns about equity and bias. The review emphasizes the need 
      for prospective validation, interpretability, workflow integration, and 
      interdisciplinary collaboration to ensure safe and effective deployment. Future 
      directions include the development of multimodal and foundation models, 
      AI-enabled point-of-care tools, and frameworks for bias mitigation and regulatory 
      oversight. As AI technologies evolve, their sustainable and ethical 
      implementation will be essential to achieving meaningful improvements in patient 
      outcomes and health system efficiency.

TI  - Multivariate longitudinal data for survival analysis of cardiovascular event 
      prediction in young adults: insights from a comparative explainable study.
PG  - 23
LID - 10.1186/s12874-023-01845-4 [doi]
LID - 23
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multivariate longitudinal data are under-utilized for survival 
      analysis compared to cross-sectional data (CS - data collected once across 
      cohort). Particularly in cardiovascular risk prediction, despite available 
      methods of longitudinal data analysis, the value of longitudinal information has 
      not been established in terms of improved predictive accuracy and clinical 
      applicability. METHODS: We investigated the value of longitudinal data over and 
      above the use of cross-sectional data via 6 distinct modeling strategies from 
      statistics, machine learning, and deep learning that incorporate repeated 
      measures for survival analysis of the time-to-cardiovascular event in the 
      Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) cohort. We then 
      examined and compared the use of model-specific interpretability methods (Random 
      Survival Forest Variable Importance) and model-agnostic methods (SHapley Additive 
      exPlanation (SHAP) and Temporal Importance Model Explanation (TIME)) in 
      cardiovascular risk prediction using the top-performing models. RESULTS: In a 
      cohort of 3539 participants, longitudinal information from 35 variables that were 
      repeatedly collected in 6 exam visits over 15 years improved subsequent long-term 
      (17 years after) risk prediction by up to 8.3% in C-index compared to using 
      baseline data (0.78 vs. 0.72), and up to approximately 4% compared to using the 
      last observed CS data (0.75). Time-varying AUC was also higher in models using 
      longitudinal data (0.86-0.87 at 5 years, 0.79-0.81 at 10 years) than using 
      baseline or last observed CS data (0.80-0.86 at 5 years, 0.73-0.77 at 10 years). 
      Comparative model interpretability analysis revealed the impact of longitudinal 
      variables on model prediction on both the individual and global scales among 
      different modeling strategies, as well as identifying the best time windows and 
      best timing within that window for event prediction. The best strategy to 
      incorporate longitudinal data for accuracy was time series massive feature 
      extraction, and the easiest interpretable strategy was trajectory clustering. 
      CONCLUSION: Our analysis demonstrates the added value of longitudinal data in 
      predictive accuracy and epidemiological utility in cardiovascular risk survival 
      analysis in young adults via a unified, scalable framework that compares model 
      performance and explainability. The framework can be extended to a larger number 
      of variables and other longitudinal modeling methods. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

AB  - This study presents a primary dataset collected from one hospital and three 
      laboratories in Iraq between 2019 and 2024. The dataset includes both the case 
      and control groups, the case group comprising patients diagnosed with six common 
      rheumatic and autoimmune diseases: rheumatoid arthritis, reactive arthritis, 
      ankylosing spondylitis, Sjögren syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, and 
      psoriatic arthritis. The dataset contains records of 12,085 patients with 
      rheumatic and autoimmune diseases. Patient privacy is ensured through data 
      anonymization. The dataset includes 14 features in seven classes, aiding the 
      development of machine learning models for the early and accurate diagnosis of 
      rheumatic and autoimmune diseases. This dataset is valuable for clinical decision 
      support, remote healthcare, drug development, and medical diagnosis. It 
      facilitates early diagnosis, supports explainable artificial intelligence models, 
      advances precision medicine, enhances research, and reduces diagnostic costs and 
      time.

TI  - Comparing Single-Hospital and National Models to Predict 30-Day Inpatient 
      Mortality.
PG  - 803-810
LID - 10.1007/s11606-024-09315-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning have 
      facilitated the creation of mortality prediction models which are increasingly 
      used to assess quality of care and inform clinical practice. One open question is 
      whether a hospital should utilize a mortality model trained from a diverse 
      nationwide dataset or use a model developed primarily from their local hospital 
      data. OBJECTIVE: To compare performance of a single-hospital, 30-day all-cause 
      mortality model against an established national benchmark on the task of 
      mortality prediction. DESIGN/PARTICIPANTS: We developed a single-hospital 
      mortality prediction model using 9975 consecutive inpatient admissions at the 
      Department of Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Healthcare System from July 26, 2018, to 
      September 30, 2021, and compared performance against an established national 
      model with similar features. MAIN MEASURES: Both the single-hospital model and 
      the national model placed each patient in one of five prediction bins: < 2.5%, 
      2.5-5%, 5-10%, 10-30%, and ≥ 30% risks of 30-day mortality. Evaluation metrics 
      included receiver operator characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC), 
      sensitivity, specificity, and balanced accuracy. Final comparisons were made 
      between the single-hospital model trained on the full training set and the 
      national model for both metrics and prediction overlap. KEY RESULTS: With 
      sufficiently large training sets of 2720 or greater inpatient admissions, there 
      was no statistically significant difference between the performances of the 
      national model (ROC AUC 0.89, 95%CI [0.858, 0.919]) and single-hospital model 
      (ROC AUC 0.878, 95%CI [0.84, 0.912]). For the 89 mortality events in the test 
      set, the single-hospital model agreed with the national model risk assessment or 
      an adjacent risk assessment in 92.1% of the encounters. CONCLUSIONS: A 
      single-hospital inpatient mortality prediction model can achieve performance 
      comparable to a national model when evaluated on a single-hospital population, 
      given sufficient sample size.

TI  - Automating General Movements Assessment with quantitative deep learning to 
      facilitate early screening of cerebral palsy.
PG  - 8294
LID - 10.1038/s41467-023-44141-x [doi]
LID - 8294
AB  - The Prechtl General Movements Assessment (GMA) is increasingly recognized for its 
      role in evaluating the integrity of the developing nervous system and predicting 
      motor dysfunctions, particularly in conditions such as cerebral palsy (CP). 
      However, the necessity for highly trained professionals has hindered the adoption 
      of GMA as an early screening tool in some countries. In this study, we propose a 
      deep learning-based motor assessment model (MAM) that combines infant videos and 
      basic characteristics, with the aim of automating GMA at the fidgety movements 
      (FMs) stage. MAM demonstrates strong performance, achieving an Area Under the 
      Curve (AUC) of 0.967 during external validation. Importantly, it adheres closely 
      to the principles of GMA and exhibits robust interpretability, as it can 
      accurately identify FMs within videos, showing substantial agreement with expert 
      assessments. Leveraging the predicted FMs frequency, a quantitative GMA method is 
      introduced, which achieves an AUC of 0.956 and enhances the diagnostic accuracy 
      of GMA beginners by 11.0%. The development of MAM holds the potential to 
      significantly streamline early CP screening and revolutionize the field of 
      video-based quantitative medical diagnostics.

AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate multivariate regional patterns for schizophrenia (SZ) 
      classification, sex differences, and brain age by utilizing structural MRI, 
      demographics, and explainable artificial intelligence (AI). METHODS: Various AI 
      models were employed, and the outperforming model was identified for SZ 
      classification, sex differences, and brain age predictions. For the SZ and sex 
      classification tasks, support vector classifier (SVC), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), 
      and deep learning neural network (DL) models were compared. In the case of 
      regression-based brain age prediction, Lasso regression (LR), Ridge regression 
      (RR), support vector regression (SVR), and DL models were compared. For each 
      regression or classification task, the optimal model was further integrated with 
      the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) and the significant multivariate brain 
      regional patterns were identified. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that the DL 
      model outperformed other models in SZ classification, sex differences, and brain 
      age predictions. We then integrated outperforming DL model with SHAP, and this 
      integrated DL-SHAP was used to identify the individualized multivariate regional 
      patterns associated with each prediction. Using DL-SHAP approach, we found that 
      individuals with SZ had anatomical changes particularly in left pallidum, left 
      posterior insula, left hippocampus, and left putamen regions, and such changes 
      associated with SZ were different between female and male patients. Finally, we 
      further applied DL-SHAP method to brain age prediction and suggested important 
      brain regions related to aging in health controls (HC) and SZ processes. 
      CONCLUSION: This study systematically utilized predictive modeling and novel 
      explainable AI approaches and identified the complex multivariate brain regions 
      involved with SZ classification, sex differences, and brain aging and built a 
      deeper understanding of neurobiological mechanisms involved in the disease, 
      offering new insights to future SZ diagnosis and treatments and laying the 
      foundation of the development of precision medicine.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The recent development of high-throughput sequencing techniques 
      provide massive data that can be used in genome-wide prediction (GWP). Although 
      GWP is effective on its own, the incorporation of traditional polygenic pedigree 
      information into GWP has been shown to further improve prediction accuracy. 
      However, most of the methods developed in this field require that individuals 
      with genomic information can be connected to the polygenic pedigree within a 
      standard linear mixed model framework that involves calculation of 
      computationally demanding matrix inverses of the combined pedigrees. The 
      extension of this integrated approach to more flexible machine learning methods 
      has been slow. METHODS: This study aims to enhance genomic prediction by 
      implementing gated residual variable selection neural networks (GRVSNN) for 
      multi-task genomic prediction. By integrating low-rank information from 
      pedigree-based relationship matrices with genomic markers, we seek to improve 
      predictive accuracy and interpretability compared to conventional regression and 
      deep learning (DL) models. The prediction properties of the GRVSNN model are 
      evaluated on several real-world datasets, including loblolly pine, mouse and pig. 
      RESULTS: The experimental results demonstrate that the GRVSNN model outperforms 
      traditional tabular genomic prediction models, including Bayesian regression 
      methods and LassoNet. Using genomic and pedigree information, GRVSNN achieves a 
      lower mean squared error (MSE), and higher Pearson (r) and distance (dCor) 
      correlation between predicted and true phenotypic values in the test data. 
      Moreover, GRVSNN selects fewer genetic markers and pedigree loadings which 
      improves interpretability. CONCLUSION: The suggested GRVSNN framework provides a 
      novel and computationally effective approach to improve genomic prediction 
      accuracy by integrating information from traditional pedigrees with genomic data. 
      The model's ability to conduct multi-task predictions underscores its potential 
      to enhance selection processes in agricultural species and predict multiple 
      diseases in precision medicine.

TI  - DRPreter: Interpretable Anticancer Drug Response Prediction Using 
      Knowledge-Guided Graph Neural Networks and Transformer.
LID - 10.3390/ijms232213919 [doi]
LID - 13919
AB  - Some of the recent studies on drug sensitivity prediction have applied graph 
      neural networks to leverage prior knowledge on the drug structure or gene 
      network, and other studies have focused on the interpretability of the model to 
      delineate the mechanism governing the drug response. However, it is crucial to 
      make a prediction model that is both knowledge-guided and interpretable, so that 
      the prediction accuracy is improved and practical use of the model can be 
      enhanced. We propose an interpretable model called DRPreter (drug response 
      predictor and interpreter) that predicts the anticancer drug response. DRPreter 
      learns cell line and drug information with graph neural networks; the cell-line 
      graph is further divided into multiple subgraphs with domain knowledge on 
      biological pathways. A type-aware transformer in DRPreter helps detect 
      relationships between pathways and a drug, highlighting important pathways that 
      are involved in the drug response. Extensive experiments on the GDSC (Genomics of 
      Drug Sensitivity and Cancer) dataset demonstrate that the proposed method 
      outperforms state-of-the-art graph-based models for drug response prediction. In 
      addition, DRPreter detected putative key genes and pathways for specific 
      drug-cell-line pairs with supporting evidence in the literature, implying that 
      our model can help interpret the mechanism of action of the drug.

TI  - Beyond digital twins: the role of foundation models in enhancing the 
      interpretability of multiomics modalities in precision medicine.
PG  - 1192-1208
LID - 10.1002/2211-5463.70003 [doi]
AB  - Medical digital twins (MDTs) are virtual representations of patients that 
      simulate the biological, physiological, and clinical processes of individuals to 
      enable personalized medicine. With the increasing complexity of omics data, 
      particularly multiomics, there is a growing need for advanced computational 
      frameworks to interpret these data effectively. Foundation models (FMs), 
      large-scale machine learning models pretrained on diverse data types, have 
      recently emerged as powerful tools for improving data interpretability and 
      decision-making in precision medicine. This review discusses the integration of 
      FMs into MDT systems, particularly their role in enhancing the interpretability 
      of multiomics data. We examine current challenges, recent advancements, and 
      future opportunities in leveraging FMs for multiomics analysis in MDTs, with a 
      focus on their application in precision medicine.

AB  - The proliferation of wearable technology enables the generation of vast amounts 
      of sensor data, offering significant opportunities for advancements in health 
      monitoring, activity recognition, and personalized medicine. However, the 
      complexity and volume of these data present substantial challenges in data 
      modeling and analysis, which have been addressed with approaches spanning time 
      series modeling to deep learning techniques. The latest frontier in this domain 
      is the adoption of large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Llama, for 
      data analysis, modeling, understanding, and human behavior monitoring through the 
      lens of wearable sensor data. This survey explores the current trends and 
      challenges in applying LLMs for sensor-based human activity recognition and 
      behavior modeling. We discuss the nature of wearable sensor data, the 
      capabilities and limitations of LLMs in modeling them, and their integration with 
      traditional machine learning techniques. We also identify key challenges, 
      including data quality, computational requirements, interpretability, and privacy 
      concerns. By examining case studies and successful applications, we highlight the 
      potential of LLMs in enhancing the analysis and interpretation of wearable sensor 
      data. Finally, we propose future directions for research, emphasizing the need 
      for improved preprocessing techniques, more efficient and scalable models, and 
      interdisciplinary collaboration. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive 
      overview of the intersection between wearable sensor data and LLMs, offering 
      insights into the current state and future prospects of this emerging field.

AB  - The increasing incidence of cutaneous melanoma highlights the critical need for 
      precision medicine to optimize treatment strategies and improve patient outcomes. 
      This study evaluated and compared the performance and interpretability of various 
      survival models for melanoma patients. We analyzed survival outcomes, including 
      overall survival (OS), specific survival (SS), and disease-free survival (DFS), 
      using the Xarxa Melanoma database, which comprises data from over 9,000 patients 
      across 19 hospitals collected over a decade. The performance of Cox Proportional 
      Hazards, Random Survival Forest, XGBoost, DeepSurv, and DeepHit models was 
      assessed using the Concordance Index (C-Index), time-dependent Area Under the 
      Curve (tdAUC), ROC-AUC, and Inverse Brier score. Our analysis showed that the 
      Random Survival Forest outperformed the other methods, achieving C-Index scores 
      of 0.846 for OS, 0.869 for SS, and 0.846 for DFS. Furthermore, by applying an 
      interpretability method specifically designed for survival analysis, we 
      identified histological subtypes associated with poor prognoses. Additionally, 
      this study reaffirms the established importance of the Breslow index as a key 
      prognostic factor in melanoma survival prediction.

AB  - Breast cancer detection remains one of the most challenging problems in medical 
      imaging. We propose a novel hybrid model that integrates Convolutional Neural 
      Networks (CNNs), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks, and 
      EfficientNet-B0, a pre-trained model. By leveraging EfficientNet-B0, which has 
      been trained on the large and diverse ImageNet dataset, our approach benefits 
      from transfer learning, enabling more efficient feature extraction from 
      mammographic images compared to traditional methods that require CNNs to be 
      trained from scratch. The model further enhances performance by incorporating 
      Bi-LSTM, which allows for processing temporal dependencies in the data, which is 
      crucial for accurately detecting complex patterns in breast cancer images. We 
      fine-tuned the model using the Adam optimizer to optimize performance, 
      significantly improving accuracy and processing speed. Extensive evaluation of 
      well-established datasets such as CBIS-DDSM and MIAS resulted in an outstanding 
      99.2% accuracy in distinguishing between benign and malignant tumors. We also 
      compared our hybrid model to other well-known architectures, including VGG-16, 
      ResNet-50, and DenseNet169, using three optimizers: Adam, RMSProp, and SGD. The 
      Adam optimizer consistently achieved the highest accuracy and lowest loss across 
      the training and validation phases. Additionally, feature visualization 
      techniques were applied to enhance the model's interpretability, providing deeper 
      insight into the decision-making process. The Proposed hybrid model sets a new 
      standard in breast cancer detection, offering exceptional accuracy and improved 
      transparency, making it a valuable tool for clinicians in the fight against 
      breast cancer.

TI  - SNVstory: inferring genetic ancestry from genome sequencing data.
PG  - 76
LID - 10.1186/s12859-024-05703-y [doi]
LID - 76
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genetic ancestry, inferred from genomic data, is a quantifiable 
      biological parameter. While much of the human genome is identical across 
      populations, it is estimated that as much as 0.4% of the genome can differ due to 
      ancestry. This variation is primarily characterized by single nucleotide variants 
      (SNVs), which are often unique to specific genetic populations. Knowledge of a 
      patient's genetic ancestry can inform clinical decisions, from genetic testing 
      and health screenings to medication dosages, based on ancestral disease 
      predispositions. Nevertheless, the current reliance on self-reported ancestry can 
      introduce subjectivity and exacerbate health disparities. While genomic 
      sequencing data enables objective determination of a patient's genetic ancestry, 
      existing approaches are limited to ancestry inference at the continental level. 
      RESULTS: To address this challenge, and create an objective, measurable metric of 
      genetic ancestry we present SNVstory, a method built upon three independent 
      machine learning models for accurately inferring the sub-continental ancestry of 
      individuals. We also introduce a novel method for simulating individual samples 
      from aggregate allele frequencies from known populations. SNVstory includes a 
      feature-importance scheme, unique among open-source ancestral tools, which allows 
      the user to track the ancestral signal broadcast by a given gene or locus. We 
      successfully evaluated SNVstory using a clinical exome sequencing dataset, 
      comparing self-reported ethnicity and race to our inferred genetic ancestry, and 
      demonstrate the capability of the algorithm to estimate ancestry from 36 
      different populations with high accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: SNVstory represents a 
      significant advance in methods to assign genetic ancestry, opening the door to 
      ancestry-informed care. SNVstory, an open-source model, is packaged as a Docker 
      container for enhanced reliability and interoperability. It can be accessed from

AB  - Computational methods have made substantial progress in improving the accuracy 
      and throughput of pathology workflows for diagnostic, prognostic, and genomic 
      prediction. Still, lack of interpretability remains a significant barrier to 
      clinical integration. We present an approach for predicting clinically-relevant 
      molecular phenotypes from whole-slide histopathology images using 
      human-interpretable image features (HIFs). Our method leverages >1.6 million 
      annotations from board-certified pathologists across >5700 samples to train deep 
      learning models for cell and tissue classification that can exhaustively map 
      whole-slide images at two and four micron-resolution. Cell- and tissue-type model 
      outputs are combined into 607 HIFs that quantify specific and 
      biologically-relevant characteristics across five cancer types. We demonstrate 
      that these HIFs correlate with well-known markers of the tumor microenvironment 
      and can predict diverse molecular signatures (AUROC 0.601-0.864), including 
      expression of four immune checkpoint proteins and homologous recombination 
      deficiency, with performance comparable to 'black-box' methods. Our HIF-based 
      approach provides a comprehensive, quantitative, and interpretable window into 
      the composition and spatial architecture of the tumor microenvironment.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Predicting preoperative cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is crucial 
      for assessing the risk of complications and adverse outcomes in patients 
      undergoing surgery. CRF is formally evaluated through submaximal exercise testing 
      with cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) or the 6-minute walk test (6MWT). 
      However, formal CRF testing is impractical as a preoperative screening tool. 
      Wrist-worn devices with actigraphy and heart rate monitoring have become 
      increasingly capable of predicting physiological measurements. Our aim was to 
      develop a clinically interpretable machine learning (ML) model using 
      wearable-derived physiological data to predict CRF for older adults, and to 
      access whether this model can accurately estimate the 6MWT distances for 
      preoperative risk evaluation. METHODS: We examined heart rate and activity data 
      collected from Fitbit devices worn by older adults (N = 65) who were scheduled to 
      undergo major noncardiac surgery. Data collection took place over a 1-week period 
      prior to surgery while participants engaged in their typical daily activities. 
      Our primary aim was to leverage this wearable technology to forecast CRF among 
      this group. We employed a machine-learning ensemble regression model to predict 
      CRF, using 6MWT outcomes as an index. Further, we applied the shapley feature 
      attribution approach to gain insights into how specific features derived from 
      wearable data contribute to CRF prediction within the model, aiding in 
      personalized fitness prediction. RESULTS: Adults with higher CRF exhibited 
      elevated levels of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), maximal 
      activity energy expenditure (aEE(max)), heart rate recovery (HRR), and non-linear 
      heart rate variability (HRV). These measures increased concurrently with 
      improvements in 6MWT outcomes. Our regression models, employing random forest and 
      linear regression techniques, demonstrated strong predictive capabilities, with 
      coefficient of determination values of 0.91 and 0.81, respectively, for 
      estimating CRF. The shapley feature attribution approach elucidated those greater 
      levels of MVPA, aEE(max), HRR, and nonlinear dynamics of HRV serve as reliable 
      indicators of enhanced CRF test performance. CONCLUSION: The integration of 
      wearable data-driven activity and heart rate metrics forms the basis for 
      utilizing wearables to provide preoperative cardiorespiratory fitness 
      assessments, supporting surgical risk stratification, personalized 
      prehabilitation, and improved patient outcomes.

TI  - Digital Cardiovascular Twins, AI Agents, and Sensor Data: A Narrative Review from 
      System Architecture to Proactive Heart Health.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease remains the world's leading cause of mortality, yet 
      everyday care still relies on episodic, symptom-driven interventions that detect 
      ischemia, arrhythmias, and remodeling only after tissue damage has begun, 
      limiting the effectiveness of therapy. A narrative review synthesized 183 studies 
      published between 2016 and 2025 that were located through PubMed, MDPI, Scopus, 
      IEEE Xplore, and Web of Science. This review examines CVD diagnostics using 
      innovative technologies such as digital cardiovascular twins, which involve the 
      collection of data from wearable IoT devices (electrocardiography (ECG), 
      photoplethysmography (PPG), and mechanocardiography), clinical records, 
      laboratory biomarkers, and genetic markers, as well as their integration with 
      artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning and deep learning, graph 
      and transformer networks for interpreting multi-dimensional data streams and 
      creating prognostic models, as well as generative AI, medical large language 
      models (LLMs), and autonomous agents for decision support, personalized alerts, 
      and treatment scenario modeling, and with cloud and edge computing for data 
      processing. This multi-layered architecture enables the detection of silent 
      pathologies long before clinical manifestations, transforming continuous 
      observations into actionable recommendations and shifting cardiology from 
      reactive treatment to predictive and preventive care. Evidence converges on four 
      layers: sensors streaming multimodal clinical and environmental data; hybrid 
      analytics that integrate hemodynamic models with deep-, graph- and transformer 
      learning while Bayesian and Kalman filters manage uncertainty; decision support 
      delivered by domain-tuned medical LLMs and autonomous agents; and prospective 
      simulations that trial pacing or pharmacotherapy before bedside use, closing the 
      prediction-intervention loop. This stack flags silent pathology weeks in advance 
      and steers proactive personalized prevention. It also lays the groundwork for 
      software-as-a-medical-device ecosystems and new regulatory guidance for 
      trustworthy AI-enabled cardiovascular care.

TI  - Interpreting patient-Specific risk prediction using contextual decomposition of 
      BiLSTMs: application to children with asthma.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Predictive modeling with longitudinal electronic health record (EHR) 
      data offers great promise for accelerating personalized medicine and better 
      informs clinical decision-making. Recently, deep learning models have achieved 
      state-of-the-art performance for many healthcare prediction tasks. However, deep 
      models lack interpretability, which is integral to successful decision-making and 
      can lead to better patient care. In this paper, we build upon the contextual 
      decomposition (CD) method, an algorithm for producing importance scores from long 
      short-term memory networks (LSTMs). We extend the method to bidirectional LSTMs 
      (BiLSTMs) and use it in the context of predicting future clinical outcomes using 
      patients' EHR historical visits. METHODS: We use a real EHR dataset comprising 
      11071 patients, to evaluate and compare CD interpretations from LSTM and BiLSTM 
      models. First, we train LSTM and BiLSTM models for the task of predicting which 
      pre-school children with respiratory system-related complications will have 
      asthma at school-age. After that, we conduct quantitative and qualitative 
      analysis to evaluate the CD interpretations produced by the contextual 
      decomposition of the trained models. In addition, we develop an interactive 
      visualization to demonstrate the utility of CD scores in explaining predicted 
      outcomes. RESULTS: Our experimental evaluation demonstrate that whenever a clear 
      visit-level pattern exists, the models learn that pattern and the contextual 
      decomposition can appropriately attribute the prediction to the correct pattern. 
      In addition, the results confirm that the CD scores agree to a large extent with 
      the importance scores generated using logistic regression coefficients. Our main 
      insight was that rather than interpreting the attribution of individual visits to 
      the predicted outcome, we could instead attribute a model's prediction to a group 
      of visits. CONCLUSION: We presented a quantitative and qualitative evidence that 
      CD interpretations can explain patient-specific predictions using CD attributions 
      of individual visits or a group of visits.

TI  - Analysis of the Relationship Between NF-κB1 and Cytokine Gene Expression in 
      Hematological Malignancy: Leveraging Explained Artificial Intelligence and 
      Machine Learning for Small Dataset Insights.
PG  - 2208-2226
LID - 10.7150/ijms.109493 [doi]
AB  - This study measures expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB)1 and related 
      cytokine genes in bone marrow mononuclear cells in patients with hematological 
      malignancies, analyzing the relationship between them with an integrated 
      framework of statistical analyses, machine learning (ML), and explainable 
      artificial intelligence (XAI). While traditional dimensionality reduction 
      techniques-such as principal component analysis, linear discriminant analysis, 
      and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding-showed limited differentiation 
      embedding, ML classifiers (k-Nearest Neighbors, Naïve Bayes Classifier, Random 
      Forest, and XGBoost) successfully identified critical patterns. Notably, 
      normalized caspase-1 counts consistently emerged as the most influential feature 
      associated with NF-κB1 activity across disease groups, as highlighted by SHapley 
      Additive exPlanations analyses. Systematic evaluation of ML performance on small 
      datasets revealed that a minimum sample size of 15-24 is necessary for reliable 
      classification outcomes, particularly in cohorts of acute myeloid leukemia and 
      myelodysplastic syndrome. These findings underscore the pivotal role of caspase-1 
      to the NF-κB1 gene expression in hematologic malignancy diseases. Furthermore, 
      this study demonstrates the feasibility of leveraging ML and XAI to derive 
      meaningful insights from limited data, offering a robust strategy for biomarker 
      discovery and precision medicine in rare hematological malignancies.

TI  - Unveiling the decision making process in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis: A 
      case-based counterfactual methodology for explainable deep learning.
PG  - 110318

AB  - BACKGROUND: The field of Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis is undergoing 
      significant transformation due to the application of deep learning (DL) models. 
      While DL surpasses traditional machine learning in disease prediction from 
      structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), the lack of explainability limits 
      clinical adoption. Counterfactual inference offers a way to integrate causal 
      explanations into these models, enhancing their robustness and transparency. NEW 
      METHOD: This study develops a novel methodology combining U-Net and generative 
      adversarial network (GAN) models to create comprehensive counterfactual 
      diagnostic maps for AD. The proposed methodology uses case-based counterfactual 
      reasoning for robust decision classification for counterfactual maps to 
      understand how changes in specific features affect the model's predictions. 
      COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: The proposed methodology is compared with 
      state-of-the-art visual explanation techniques across the ADNI dataset. The 
      proposed methodology is also benchmarked against other gradient-based and 
      generative models for its ability to generate comprehensive counterfactual maps. 
      RESULTS: The results demonstrate that the proposed methodology significantly 
      outperforms existing methods in accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity while 
      providing detailed counterfactual maps that visualize how slight changes in brain 
      morphology could lead to different diagnostic outcomes. The proposed methodology 
      achieves an accuracy of 95 % and an AUC of 0.97, illustrating its superiority in 
      capturing subtle yet crucial anatomical features. CONCLUSIONS: By generating 
      intuitive visual explanations, the proposed methodology improves the 
      interpretability and robustness of AD diagnostic models, making them more 
      reliable and accountable. The use of counterfactual inference enhances 
      clinicians' understanding of disease progression and the impact of different 
      interventions, fostering precision medicine in AD care.

TI  - Predicting overall survival in glioblastoma patients using machine learning: an 
      analysis of treatment efficacy and patient prognosis.

LID - 1539845
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Glioblastoma (GBM), the most aggressive primary brain tumor, poses 
      a significant challenge in predicting patient survival due to its heterogeneity 
      and resistance to treatment. Accurate survival prediction is essential for 
      optimizing treatment strategies and improving clinical outcomes. METHODS: This 
      study utilized metadata from 135 GBM patients, including demographic, clinical, 
      and molecular variables such as age, Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), MGMT 
      promoter methylation, and EGFR amplification. Six machine learning 
      models-XGBoost, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, Artificial Neural 
      Networks, Extra Trees Regressor, and K- Nearest Neighbors-were employed to 
      classify patients into predefined survival categories. Data preprocessing 
      included label encoding for categorical variables and MinMax scaling for 
      numerical features. Model performance was assessed using ROC-AUC and accuracy 
      metrics, with hyperparameters optimized through grid search. RESULTS: XGBoost 
      demonstrated the highest predictive accuracy, achieving a mean ROC-AUC of 0.90 
      and an accuracy of 0.78. Ensemble models outperformed simpler classifiers, 
      emphasizing the predictive value of metadata. The models identified key 
      prognostic markers, including MGMT promoter methylation and KPS, as significant 
      contributors to survival prediction. CONCLUSIONS: The application of machine 
      learning to GBM metadata offers a robust approach to predicting patient survival. 
      The study highlights the potential of ML models to enhance clinical 
      decision-making and contribute to personalized treatment strategies, with a focus

TI  - Precision Basecalling of Single DNA Nucleotide from Overlapped Transmission 
      Readouts with Machine Learning Aided Solid-State Nanogap.

AB  - DNA sequencing with the quantum tunneling technique heralds a paradigm shift in 
      genetic analysis, promising rapid and accurate identification for diverging 
      applications ranging from personalized medicine to security issues. However, the 
      widespread distribution of molecular conductance, conduction orbital alignment 
      for resonant transport, and decoding crisscrossing conductance signals of 
      isomorphic nucleotides have been persistent experimental hurdles for swift and 
      precise identification. Herein, we have reported a machine learning (ML)-driven 
      quantum tunneling study with solid-state model nanogap to determine nucleotides 
      at single-base resolution. The optimized ML basecaller has demonstrated a high 
      predictive basecalling accuracy of all four nucleotides from seven distinct data 
      pools, each containing complex transmission readouts of their different dynamic 
      conformations. ML classification of quaternary, ternary, and binary nucleotide 
      combinations is also performed with high precision, sensitivity, and F1 score. ML 
      explainability unravels the evidence of how extracted normalized features within 
      overlapped nucleotide signals contribute to classification improvement. Moreover, 
      electronic fingerprints, conductance sensitivity, and current readout analysis of 
      nucleotides have promised practical applicability with significant sensitivity 
      and distinguishability. Through this ML approach, our study pushes the boundaries 
      of quantum sequencing by highlighting the effectiveness of single nucleotide 
      basecalling with promising implications for advancing genomics and molecular 
      diagnostics.

TI  - Temporal generative models for learning heterogeneous group dynamics of 
      ecological momentary assessment data.
LID - 10.1093/biomtc/ujae115 [doi]
LID - ujae115
AB  - One of the goals of precision psychiatry is to characterize mental disorders in 
      an individualized manner, taking into account the underlying dynamic processes. 
      Recent advances in mobile technologies have enabled the collection of ecological 
      momentary assessments that capture multiple responses in real-time at high 
      frequency. However, ecological momentary assessment data are often 
      multi-dimensional, correlated, and hierarchical. Mixed-effect models are commonly 
      used but may require restrictive assumptions about the fixed and random effects 
      and the correlation structure. The recurrent temporal restricted Boltzmann 
      machine (RTRBM) is a generative neural network that can be used to model temporal 
      data, but most existing RTRBM approaches do not account for the potential 
      heterogeneity of group dynamics within a population based on available 
      covariates. In this paper, we propose a new temporal generative model, the HDRBM, 
      to learn the heterogeneous group dynamics and demonstrate the effectiveness of 
      this approach on simulated and real-world ecological momentary assessment 
      datasets. We show that by incorporating covariates, HDRBM can improve accuracy 
      and interpretability, explore the underlying drivers of the group dynamics of 
      participants, and serve as a generative model for ecological momentary assessment 
      studies.

TI  - ADVANCING THE UNDERSTANDING OF CLINICAL SEPSIS USING GENE EXPRESSION-DRIVEN 
      MACHINE LEARNING TO IMPROVE PATIENT OUTCOMES.
PG  - 4-18
LID - 10.1097/SHK.0000000000002227 [doi]
AB  - Sepsis remains a major challenge that necessitates improved approaches to enhance 
      patient outcomes. This study explored the potential of machine learning (ML) 
      techniques to bridge the gap between clinical data and gene expression 
      information to better predict and understand sepsis. We discuss the application 
      of ML algorithms, including neural networks, deep learning, and ensemble methods, 
      to address key evidence gaps and overcome the challenges in sepsis research. The 
      lack of a clear definition of sepsis is highlighted as a major hurdle, but ML 
      models offer a workaround by focusing on endpoint prediction. We emphasize the 
      significance of gene transcript information and its use in ML models to provide 
      insights into sepsis pathophysiology and biomarker identification. Temporal 
      analysis and integration of gene expression data further enhance the accuracy and 
      predictive capabilities of ML models for sepsis. Although challenges such as 
      interpretability and bias exist, ML research offers exciting prospects for 
      addressing critical clinical problems, improving sepsis management, and advancing 
      precision medicine approaches. Collaborative efforts between clinicians and data 
      scientists are essential for the successful implementation and translation of ML 
      models into clinical practice. Machine learning has the potential to 
      revolutionize our understanding of sepsis and significantly improve patient 
      outcomes. Further research and collaboration between clinicians and data 
      scientists are needed to fully understand the potential of ML in sepsis 
      management.

TI  - From pixels to prognosis: unveiling radiomics models with SHAP and LIME for 
      enhanced interpretability.
LID - 10.1088/2057-1976/ad34db [doi]
AB  - Radiomics-based prediction models have shown promise in predicting Radiation 
      Pneumonitis (RP), a common adverse outcome of chest irradiation. Τhis study looks 
      into more than just RP: it also investigates a bigger shift in the way 
      radiomics-based models work. By integrating multi-modal radiomic data, which 
      includes a wide range of variables collected from medical images including 
      cutting-edge PET/CT imaging, we have developed predictive models that capture the 
      intricate nature of illness progression. Radiomic features were extracted using 
      PyRadiomics, encompassing intensity, texture, and shape measures. The 
      high-dimensional dataset formed the basis for our predictive models, primarily 
      Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)-XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. Performance 
      evaluation metrics, including Multi-Modal AUC-ROC, Sensitivity, Specificity, and 
      F1-Score, underscore the superiority of the Deep Neural Network (DNN) model. The 
      DNN achieved a remarkable Multi-Modal AUC-ROC of 0.90, indicating superior 
      discriminatory power. Sensitivity and specificity values of 0.85 and 0.91, 
      respectively, highlight its effectiveness in detecting positive occurrences while 
      accurately identifying negatives. External validation datasets, comprising 
      retrospective patient data and a heterogeneous patient population, validate the 
      robustness and generalizability of our models. The focus of our study is the 
      application of sophisticated model interpretability methods, namely SHAP (SHapley 
      Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic 
      Explanations), to improve the clarity and understanding of predictions. These 
      methods allow clinicians to visualize the effects of features and provide 
      localized explanations for every prediction, enhancing the comprehensibility of 
      the model. This strengthens trust and collaboration between computational 
      technologies and medical competence. The integration of data-driven analytics and 
      medical domain expertise represents a significant shift in the profession, 
      advancing us from analyzing pixel-level information to gaining valuable 
      prognostic insights.

TI  - Development and Validation of an Early Recurrence Prediction Model for High-Grade 
      Glioma Integrating Temporalis Muscle and Tumor Features: Exploring the Prognostic 
      Value of Temporalis Muscle.
LID - 10.1007/s10278-025-01491-w [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to develop and validate a predictive model for early recurrence 
      of high-grade glioma (HGG) within 180 days, assess the prognostic value of 
      preoperative and postoperative temporalis muscle metrics (area and thickness), 
      and explore their significance in postoperative follow-up. Seventy-one 
      molecularly confirmed HGG patients were included, with data sourced from local 
      data and TCIA (The Cancer Imaging Archive) RHUH-GBM (Río Hortega University 
      Hospital Glioblastoma) dataset. Tumor segmentation was performed using deep 
      learning, and radiomic features were extracted following comparison with manual 
      segmentation. Feature selection was conducted using mutual information and 
      recursive feature elimination. A comprehensive model integrating 3D tumor 
      radiomics and temporalis muscle metrics was developed and compared with a 
      tumor-only model to identify the optimal predictive framework. SHAP analysis was 
      used to evaluate model interpretability and feature importance. The 
      TM_Tumor_HistGradientBoosting model, incorporating 16 features including 
      temporalis muscle metrics, outperformed the tumor-only model in accuracy (0.89), 
      recall (0.87), and F1 score (0.88). SHAP analysis highlighted that preoperative 
      temporalis muscle cross-sectional area was strongly associated with early 
      recurrence risk, while postoperative temporalis muscle thickness significantly 
      contributed to recurrence prediction. Combining temporalis muscle metrics with 
      preoperative tumor MRI substantially improved the accuracy of early recurrence 
      prediction in HGG. Temporalis muscle metrics serve as objective and sustainable 
      prognostic indicators with significant clinical value in postoperative follow-up.

TI  - AI-Driven Prediction of Glasgow Coma Scale Outcomes in Anterior Communicating 
      Artery Aneurysms.
LID - 10.3390/jcm14082672 [doi]
LID - 2672
AB  - Background: The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is a cornerstone in neurological 
      assessment, providing critical insights into consciousness levels in patients 
      with traumatic brain injuries and other neurological conditions. Despite its 
      clinical importance, traditional methods for predicting GCS scores often fail to 
      capture the complex, multi-dimensional nature of patient data. This study aims to 
      address this gap by leveraging machine learning (ML) techniques to develop 
      accurate, interpretable models for GCS prediction, enhancing decision making in 
      critical care. Methods: A comprehensive dataset of 759 patients, encompassing 25 
      features spanning pre-, intra-, and post-operative stages, was used to develop 
      predictive models. The dataset included key variables such as cognitive 
      impairments, Hunt and Hess scores, and aneurysm dimensions. Six ML algorithms, 
      including random forest (RF), XGBoost, and artificial neural networks (ANN), were 
      trained and rigorously evaluated. Data preprocessing involved numerical encoding, 
      standardization, and stratified splitting into training and validation subsets. 
      Model performance was assessed using accuracy and receiver operating 
      characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC) metrics. Results: The RF model 
      achieved the highest accuracy (86.4%) and mean ROC AUC (0.9592 ± 0.0386, standard 
      deviation), highlighting its robustness and reliability in handling heterogeneous 
      clinical datasets. XGBoost and SVM models also demonstrated strong performance 
      (ROC AUC = 0.9502 and 0.9462, respectively). Key predictors identified included 
      the Hunt and Hess score, aneurysm dimensions, and post-operative factors such as 
      prolonged intubation. Ensemble methods outperformed simpler models, such as 
      K-nearest neighbors (KNN), which struggled with high-dimensional data. 
      Conclusions: This study demonstrates the transformative potential of ML in GCS 
      prediction, offering accurate and interpretable tools that go beyond traditional 
      methods. By integrating advanced algorithms with clinically relevant features, 
      this work provides a dynamic, data-driven framework for critical care decision 
      making. The findings lay the groundwork for future advancements, including 
      multi-modal data integration and broader validation, positioning ML as a vital 
      tool in personalized neurological care.

TI  - PLSKB: An Interactive Knowledge Base to Support Diagnosis, Treatment, and 
      Screening of Lynch Syndrome on the Basis of Precision Oncology.
PG  - e2400246
LID - 10.1200/CCI-24-00246 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Understanding the genetic heterogeneity of Lynch syndrome (LS) cancers 
      has led to significant scientific advancements. However, these findings are 
      widely dispersed across various resources, making it difficult for clinicians and 
      researchers to stay informed. Furthermore, the uneven quality of studies and the 
      lack of effective translation of knowledge into clinical practice create 
      challenges in delivering optimal patient care. To address these issues, we 
      developed and launched the Precision Lynch Syndrome Knowledge Base (PLSKB), a 
      specialized, interactive web-based platform that consolidates comprehensive 
      information on LS. METHODS: To create the PLSKB, we conducted an extensive 
      literature review and gathered data from reliable sources. Through an extensive 
      literature review and survey of other reliable sources, we have extracted 
      prominent and relevant content with a high level of accuracy, transparency, and 
      detailed provenance. To enhance usability, we implemented an evidence-leveling 
      framework, categorizing studies on the basis of the type of research, 
      reliability, and applicability to clinical care. The platform is designed to be 
      dynamic, with updates performed monthly to incorporate the latest research. 
      RESULTS: The PLSKB integrates a broad spectrum of data related to LS, including 
      biomarkers, cancer types, screening and prevention strategies, diagnostic 
      methods, and therapeutics options. This centralized resource is intended to 
      support clinicians and researchers in making evidence-based decisions throughout 
      surveillance and care processes. Its interactive design and frequent updates 
      ensure that users have access to the most current and relevant findings. 
      CONCLUSION: The PLSKB bridges the gap between research and clinical practice by 
      offering a reliable, up-to-date repository of evidence-based information. This 
      tool empowers clinicians and researchers to deliver precision care and advance 
      research for LS and related conditions, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Heart Failure (HF) complicated by thyroid dysfunction presents a 
      complex clinical challenge, demanding more advanced risk stratification tools. In 
      this study, we propose an AI-driven machine learning (ML) approach to predict 
      mortality and hospitalization risk in HF patients with coexisting thyroid 
      disorders. METHODS: Using a retrospective cohort of 762 HF patients (including 
      euthyroid, hypothyroid, hyperthyroid, and low T3 syndrome cases), we developed 
      and optimized several ML models-including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, 
      Support Vector Machines, and others-to identify high-risk individuals. RESULTS: 
      The best-performing model, a Random Forest classifier, achieved robust predictive 
      accuracy for both 1-year mortality and HF-related hospitalization (area under the 
      ROC curve ∼0.80 for each). We further employed model interpretability techniques 
      (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations, LIME) to elucidate key 
      predictors of risk at the individual level. This interpretability revealed that 
      factors such as atrial fibrillation, absence of cardiac resynchronization 
      therapy, amiodarone use, and abnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels 
      strongly influenced model predictions, providing clinicians with transparent 
      insights into each prediction. Additionally, a multi-objective risk 
      stratification analysis across thyroid status subgroups highlighted that patients 
      with hypothyroidism and low T3 syndrome are particularly vulnerable under 
      high-risk conditions, indicating a need for closer monitoring and tailored 
      interventions in these groups. DISCUSSION: In summary, our study demonstrates an 
      innovative AI methodology for medical risk prediction: interpretable ML models 
      can accurately stratify mortality and hospitalization risk in HF patients with 
      thyroid dysfunction, offering a novel tool for personalized medicine. These 
      findings suggest that integrating explainable AI into clinical workflows can 
      improve prognostic precision and inform targeted management, though prospective 
      validation is warranted to confirm realworld applicability.

AB  - Modeling of signaling pathways is crucial for understanding and predicting 
      cellular responses to drug treatments. However, canonical signaling pathways 
      curated from literature are seldom context-specific and thus can hardly predict 
      cell type-specific response to external perturbations; purely data-driven methods 
      also have drawbacks such as limited biological interpretability. Therefore, 
      hybrid methods that can integrate prior knowledge and real data for network 
      inference are highly desirable. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-guided 
      fuzzy logic network model to infer signaling pathways by exploiting both prior 
      knowledge and time-series data. In particular, the dynamic time warping algorithm 
      is employed to measure the goodness of fit between experimental and predicted 
      data, so that our method can model temporally-ordered experimental observations. 
      We evaluated the proposed method on a synthetic dataset and two real 
      phosphoproteomic datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our model 
      can uncover drug-induced alterations in signaling pathways in cancer cells. 
      Compared with existing hybrid models, our method can model feedback loops so that 
      the dynamical mechanisms of signaling networks can be uncovered from time-series 
      data. By calibrating generic models of signaling pathways against real data, our 
      method supports precise predictions of context-specific anticancer drug effects, 
      which is an important step towards precision medicine.

AB  - Patient classification based on clinical and genomic data will further the goal 
      of precision medicine. Interpretability is of particular relevance for models 
      based on genomic data, where sample sizes are relatively small (in the hundreds), 
      increasing overfitting risk netDx is a machine learning method to integrate 
      multi-modal patient data and build a patient classifier. Patient data are 
      converted into networks of patient similarity, which is intuitive to clinicians 
      who also use patient similarity for medical diagnosis. Features passing selection 
      are integrated, and new patients are assigned to the class with the greatest 
      profile similarity. netDx has excellent performance, outperforming most 
      machine-learning methods in binary cancer survival prediction. It handles missing 
      data - a common problem in real-world data - without requiring imputation. netDx 
      also has excellent interpretability, with native support to group genes into 
      pathways for mechanistic insight into predictive features. The netDx Bioconductor 
      package provides multiple workflows for users to build custom patient 
      classifiers. It provides turnkey functions for one-step predictor generation from 
      multi-modal data, including feature selection over multiple train/test data 
      splits. Workflows offer versatility with custom feature design, choice of 
      similarity metric; speed is improved by parallel execution. Built-in functions 
      and examples allow users to compute model performance metrics such as AUROC, 
      AUPR, and accuracy. netDx uses RCy3 to visualize top-scoring pathways and the 
      final integrated patient network in Cytoscape. Advanced users can build more 
      complex predictor designs with functional building blocks used in the default 
      design. Finally, the netDx Bioconductor package provides a novel workflow for 
      pathway-based patient classification from sparse genetic data.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The low probability of identifying druggable mutations through 
      comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) and its financial and time costs hinder its 
      widespread adoption. To enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of cancer 
      precision medicine, it is critical to identify patient characteristics that are 
      most likely to benefit from CGP. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This nationwide 
      retrospective study employed machine learning models to predict the 
      identification of genome-matched therapies by CGP, utilizing a national database 
      covering 99.7% of the patients who underwent CGP in Japan from June 2019 to 
      November 2023. Prediction models were constructed for the overall cancer 
      population, specific cancer types, and adolescent and young adult (AYA) group. 
      The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) algorithm was applied to elucidate 
      clinical features contributing to model predictions. RESULTS: This study included 
      60 655 patients [mean age (standard deviation), 60.8 years (14.5 years); 50.1% 
      males]. CGP identified at least one genome-matched therapy in 11 227 cases 
      (18.5%). The best prediction model was eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) with 
      an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.819. Cancer type 
      was the most important predictor (negative for pancreas and positive for breast 
      and lung), followed by the age, presence of liver metastasis, and number of 
      metastatic sites. Analysis of cancer type-specific models identified several 
      organ-specific features, including the sex, interval between the cancer diagnosis 
      and CGP, sampling site, and CGP panel. Among 3455 AYA patients, genome-matched 
      therapies were identified in 459 patients (13.3%). The AYA-specific model 
      achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.768, with 
      bone tumor identified as a negative predictor in addition to those identified in 
      the overall cancer population model. CONCLUSION: Several factors predicting the 
      identification of genome-matched therapies through CGP were identified for the 
      overall cancer population and cancer type-specific subpopulations. Expedited CGP 
      is recommended for patients who match the identified profile to facilitate early 
      targeted therapy.

TI  - Machine Learning Methodologies for Prediction of Rhythm-Control Strategy in 
      Patients Diagnosed With Atrial Fibrillation: Observational, Retrospective, 
      Case-Control Study.
PG  - e29225
LID - 10.2196/29225 [doi]
LID - e29225
AB  - BACKGROUND: The identification of an appropriate rhythm management strategy for 
      patients diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (AF) remains a major challenge for 
      providers. Although clinical trials have identified subgroups of patients in whom 
      a rate- or rhythm-control strategy might be indicated to improve outcomes, the 
      wide range of presentations and risk factors among patients presenting with AF 
      makes such approaches challenging. The strength of electronic health records is 
      the ability to build in logic to guide management decisions, such that the system 
      can automatically identify patients in whom a rhythm-control strategy is more 
      likely and can promote efficient referrals to specialists. However, like any 
      clinical decision support tool, there is a balance between interpretability and 
      accurate prediction. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to create an electronic health 
      record-based prediction tool to guide patient referral to specialists for 
      rhythm-control management by comparing different machine learning algorithms. 
      METHODS: We compared machine learning models of increasing complexity and used up 
      to 50,845 variables to predict the rhythm-control strategy in 42,022 patients 
      within the University of Colorado Health system at the time of AF diagnosis. 
      Models were evaluated on the basis of their classification accuracy, defined by 
      the F1 score and other metrics, and interpretability, captured by inspection of 
      the relative importance of each predictor. RESULTS: We found that age was by far 
      the strongest single predictor of a rhythm-control strategy but that greater 
      accuracy could be achieved with more complex models incorporating neural networks 
      and more predictors for each participant. We determined that the impact of better 
      prediction models was notable primarily in the rate of inappropriate referrals 
      for rhythm-control, in which more complex models provided an average of 20% fewer 
      inappropriate referrals than simpler, more interpretable models. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      conclude that any health care system seeking to incorporate algorithms to guide 
      rhythm management for patients with AF will need to address this trade-off 
      between prediction accuracy and model interpretability.

TI  - Prediction of early postoperative complications and transfusion risk after lumbar 
      spinal stenosis surgery in geriatric patients: machine learning approach based on 
      comprehensive geriatric assessment.
PG  - 279

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lumbar spinal stenosis is one of the most common surgery-requiring 
      conditions of the spine in the aged population. As elderly patients often present 
      with multiple comorbidities and limited physiological reserve, individualized 
      risk assessment using comprehensive geriatric assessment is crucial for 
      optimizing surgical outcomes. METHODS: Patients 65 years or older who underwent 
      elective surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis between June 2015 and December 2018 
      were prospectively enrolled, resulting in 261 eligible patients of age 72.3 ± 4.8 
      years (male 108, female 153). Twenty-seven experienced complications of 
      Clavien-Dindo grade 2 or higher within 30 days, and 79 received transfusion 
      during hospital stay. The cohort was split into train-validation (n = 208) and 
      test (n = 53) sets. A total of 48 features, including demographics, comorbidity, 
      nutrition, and perioperative status, were collected. Logistic regression, support 
      vector machine (SVM), random forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM were trained using 
      five-fold cross-validation. AUROC and AUPRC were considered the primary 
      performance metrics, and the results were compared with those estimated with 
      ACS-NSQIP scoring system. A set of Compact models incorporating a smaller number 
      of features was also trained, and SHAP analysis was conducted to evaluate the 
      models' interpretability. RESULTS: The reduced number of features did not result 
      in the drop of AUROC and AUPRC for all machine learning algorithms (P > 0.05). 
      when compared to the ACS-NSQIP scoring system, which achieved a test AUROC of 
      0.38 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.13-0.73) and 0.22 (95% CI, 0.10-0.36) on 
      the first two tasks, the Compact model showed significantly greater AUROC values 
      nearing or surpassing 0.90. Decision tree-based algorithms demonstrated larger 
      test AUROC than logistic regression and generally agreed on the most influential 
      features for each task. CONCLUSIONS: Advanced machine learning models have 
      consistently shown greater performance and interpretability over conventional 
      methodologies, implying their potential for a more individualized risk assessment 
      of the aged population. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Not applicable as this research is 
      not a clinical trial.

TI  - A Multimodal AI Framework for Automated Multiclass Lung Disease Diagnosis from 
      Respiratory Sounds with Simulated Biomarker Fusion and Personalized Medication 
      Recommendation.
LID - 10.3390/ijms26157135 [doi]
LID - 7135
AB  - Respiratory diseases represent a persistent global health challenge, underscoring 
      the need for intelligent, accurate, and personalized diagnostic and therapeutic 
      systems. Existing methods frequently suffer from limitations in diagnostic 
      precision, lack of individualized treatment, and constrained adaptability to 
      complex clinical scenarios. To address these challenges, our study introduces a 
      modular AI-powered framework that integrates an audio-based disease 
      classification model with simulated molecular biomarker profiles to evaluate the 
      feasibility of future multimodal diagnostic extensions, alongside a 
      synthetic-data-driven prescription recommendation engine. The disease 
      classification model analyzes respiratory sound recordings and accurately 
      distinguishes among eight clinical classes: bronchiectasis, pneumonia, upper 
      respiratory tract infection (URTI), lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), 
      asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiolitis, and healthy 
      respiratory state. The proposed model achieved a classification accuracy of 
      99.99% on a holdout test set, including 94.2% accuracy on pediatric samples. In 
      parallel, the prescription module provides individualized treatment 
      recommendations comprising drug, dosage, and frequency trained on a carefully 
      constructed synthetic dataset designed to emulate real-world prescribing 
      logic.The model achieved over 99% accuracy in medication prediction tasks, 
      outperforming baseline models such as those discussed in research. Minimal 
      misclassification in the confusion matrix and strong clinician agreement on 200 
      prescriptions (Cohen's κ = 0.91 [0.87-0.94] for drug selection, 0.78 [0.74-0.81] 
      for dosage, 0.96 [0.93-0.98] for frequency) further affirm the system's 
      reliability. Adjusted clinician disagreement rates were 2.7% (drug), 6.4% 
      (dosage), and 1.5% (frequency). SHAP analysis identified age and smoking as key 
      predictors, enhancing model explainability. Dosage accuracy was 91.3%, and most 
      disagreements occurred in renal-impaired and pediatric cases. However, our study 
      is presented strictly as a proof-of-concept. The use of synthetic data and the 
      absence of access to real patient records constitute key limitations. A trialed 
      clinical deployment was conducted under a controlled environment with a positive 
      rate of satisfaction from experts and users, but the proposed system must undergo 
      extensive validation with de-identified electronic medical records (EMRs) and 
      regulatory scrutiny before it can be considered for practical application. 
      Nonetheless, the findings offer a promising foundation for the future development 
      of clinically viable AI-assisted respiratory care tools.

AB  - Predicting the response of a cancer cell line to a therapeutic drug is pivotal 
      for personalized medicine. Despite numerous deep learning methods that have been 
      developed for drug response prediction, integrating diverse information about 
      biological entities and predicting the directional response remain major 
      challenges. Here, we propose a novel interpretable predictive model, DRExplainer, 
      which leverages a directed graph convolutional network to enhance the prediction 
      in a directed bipartite network framework. DRExplainer constructs a directed 
      bipartite network integrating multi-omics profiles of cell lines, the chemical 
      structure of drugs and known drug response to achieve directed prediction. Then, 
      DRExplainer identifies the most relevant subgraph to each prediction in this 
      directed bipartite network by learning a mask, facilitating critical medical 
      decision-making. Additionally, we introduce a quantifiable method for model 
      interpretability that leverages a ground truth benchmark dataset curated from 
      biological features. In computational experiments, DRExplainer outperforms 
      state-of-the-art predictive methods and another graph-based explanation method 
      under the same experimental setting. Finally, the case studies further validate 
      the interpretability and the effectiveness of DRExplainer in predictive novel 
      drug response. Our code is available at:

AB  - As a complex neural network system, the brain regions and genes collaborate to 
      effectively store and transmit information. We abstract the collaboration 
      correlations as the brain region gene community network (BG-CN) and present a new 
      deep learning approach, such as the community graph convolutional neural network 
      (Com-GCN), for investigating the transmission of information within and between 
      communities. The results can be used for diagnosing and extracting causal factors 
      for Alzheimer's disease (AD). First, an affinity aggregation model for BG-CN is 
      developed to describe intercommunity and intracommunity information transmission. 
      Second, we design the Com-GCN architecture with intercommunity convolution and 
      intracommunity convolution operations based on the affinity aggregation model. 
      Through sufficient experimental validation on the AD neuroimaging initiative

TI  - Wearable Hydrogel-Based Epidermal Sensor with Thermal Compatibility and Long Term 
      Stability for Smart Colorimetric Multi-Signals Monitoring.
PG  - e2201730
LID - 10.1002/adhm.202201730 [doi]
AB  - Hydrogel-based wearable epidermal sensors (HWESs) have attracted widespread 
      attention in health monitoring, especially considering their colorimetric readout 
      capability. However, it remains challenging for HWESs to work at extreme 
      temperatures with long term stability due to the existence of water. Herein, a 
      wearable transparent epidermal sensor with thermal compatibility and long term 
      stability for smart colorimetric multi-signals monitoring is developed, based on 
      an anti-freezing and anti-drying hydrogel with high transparency (over 90% 
      transmittance), high stretchability (up to 1500%) and desirable adhesiveness to 
      various kinds of substrates. The hydrogel consists of polyacrylic acid, 
      polyacrylamide, and tannic acid-coated cellulose nanocrystals in glycerin/water 
      binary solvents. When glycerin readily forms strong hydrogen bonds with water, 
      the hydrogel exhibits outstanding thermal compatibility. Furthermore, the 
      hydrogel maintains excellent adhesion, stretchability, and transparency after 
      long term storage (45 days) or at subzero temperatures (-20 °C). For smart 
      colorimetric multi-signals monitoring, the freestanding smart colorimetric HWESs 
      are utilized for simultaneously monitoring the pH, T and light, where 
      colorimetric signals can be read and stored by artificial intelligence strategies 
      in a real time manner. In summary, the developed wearable transparent epidermal 
      sensor holds great potential for monitoring multi-signals with visible readouts 
      in long term health monitoring.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications have the potential to revolutionize 
      conventional healthcare practices, creating a more efficient and patient-centred 
      approach with improved outcomes. This guide discuses eighteen AI-based 
      applications in clinical decision-making, precision medicine, operational 
      efficiency, and predictive analytics, including a real-world example of AI's role 
      in public health during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, 
      we address ethical questions, transparency, data privacy, bias, consent, 
      accountability, and liability, and the strategic measures that must be taken to 
      align AI with ethical principles, legal frameworks, legacy information technology 
      systems, and employee skills and knowledge. We emphasize the importance of 
      informed and strategic approaches to harness AI's potential and manage its 
      challenges. Moreover, this guide underscores the importance of evaluating and 
      integrating new skills and competencies to navigate and use AI-based technologies 
      in healthcare management, such as technological literacy, long-term strategic 
      vision, change management skills, ethical decision-making, and alignment with 
      patient needs.

TI  - A personalized and evolutionary algorithm for interpretable EEG epilepsy seizure 
      prediction.
PG  - 3415

LID - 3415
AB  - Seizure prediction may improve the quality of life of patients suffering from 
      drug-resistant epilepsy, which accounts for about 30% of the total epileptic 
      patients. The pre-ictal period determination, characterized by a transitional 
      stage between normal brain activity and seizure, is a critical step. Past 
      approaches failed to attain real-world applicability due to lack of 
      generalization capacity. More recently, deep learning techniques may outperform 
      traditional classifiers and handle time dependencies. However, despite the 
      existing efforts for providing interpretable insights, clinicians may not be 
      willing to make high-stake decisions based on them. Furthermore, a 
      disadvantageous aspect of the more usual seizure prediction pipeline is its 
      modularity and significant independence between stages. An alternative could be 
      the construction of a search algorithm that, while considering pipeline stages' 
      synergy, fine-tunes the selection of a reduced set of features that are widely 
      used in the literature and computationally efficient. With extracranial 
      recordings from 19 patients suffering from temporal-lobe seizures, we developed a 
      patient-specific evolutionary optimization strategy, aiming to generate the 
      optimal set of features for seizure prediction with a logistic regression 
      classifier, which was tested prospectively in a total of 49 seizures and 710 h of 
      continuous recording and performed above chance for 32% of patients, using a 
      surrogate predictor. These results demonstrate the hypothesis of pre-ictal period 
      identification without the loss of interpretability, which may help understanding 
      brain dynamics leading to seizures and improve prediction algorithms.

TI  - Gene dysregulation analysis builds a mechanistic signature for prognosis and 
      therapeutic benefit in colorectal cancer.
PG  - 881-893
LID - 10.1093/jmcb/mjaa041 [doi]
AB  - The implementation of cancer precision medicine requires biomarkers or signatures 
      for predicting prognosis and therapeutic benefits. Most of current efforts in 
      this field are paying much more attention to predictive accuracy than to 
      molecular mechanistic interpretability. Mechanism-driven strategy has recently 
      emerged, aiming to build signatures with both predictive power and explanatory 
      power. Driven by this strategy, we developed a robust gene dysregulation analysis 
      framework with machine learning algorithms, which is capable of exploring gene 
      dysregulations underlying carcinogenesis from high-dimensional data with 
      cooperativity and synergy between regulators and several other transcriptional 
      regulation rules taken into consideration. We then applied the framework to a 
      colorectal cancer (CRC) cohort from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The identified 
      CRC-related dysregulations significantly covered known carcinogenic processes and 
      exhibited good prognostic effect. By choosing dysregulations with greedy 
      strategy, we built a four-dysregulation (4-DysReg) signature, which has the 
      capability of predicting prognosis and adjuvant chemotherapy benefit. 4-DysReg 
      has the potential to explain carcinogenesis in terms of dysfunctional 
      transcriptional regulation. These results demonstrate that our gene dysregulation 
      analysis framework could be used to develop predictive signature with mechanistic 
      interpretability for cancer precision medicine, and furthermore, elucidate the 
      mechanisms of carcinogenesis.

TI  - Revolutionizing Oncology Through AI: Addressing Cancer Disparities by Improving 
      Screening, Treatment, and Survival Outcomes via Integration of Social 
      Determinants of Health.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Social determinants of health (SDOH) are critical contributors to 
      cancer disparities, influencing prevention, early detection, treatment access, 
      and survival outcomes. Addressing these disparities is essential in achieving 
      equitable oncology care. Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing oncology 
      by leveraging advanced computational methods to address SDOH-driven disparities 
      through predictive analytics, data integration, and precision medicine. METHODS: 
      This review synthesizes findings from systematic reviews and original research on 
      AI applications in cancer-focused SDOH research. Key methodologies include 
      machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), deep learning-based 
      medical imaging, and explainable AI (XAI). Special emphasis is placed on AI's 
      ability to analyze large-scale oncology datasets, including electronic health 
      records (EHRs), geographic information systems (GIS), and real-world clinical 
      trial data, to enhance cancer risk stratification, optimize screening programs, 
      and improve resource allocation. RESULTS: AI has demonstrated significant 
      advancements in cancer diagnostics, treatment planning, and survival prediction 
      by integrating SDOH data. AI-driven radiomics and histopathology have enhanced 
      early detection, particularly in underserved populations. Predictive modeling has 
      improved personalized oncology care, enabling stratification based on 
      socioeconomic and environmental factors. However, challenges remain, including AI 
      bias in screening, trial underrepresentation, and treatment recommendation 
      disparities. CONCLUSIONS: AI holds substantial potential to reduce cancer 
      disparities by integrating SDOH into risk prediction, screening, and treatment 
      personalization. Ethical deployment, bias mitigation, and robust regulatory 
      frameworks are essential in ensuring fairness in AI-driven oncology. Integrating 
      AI into precision oncology and public health strategies can bridge cancer care 
      gaps, enhance early detection, and improve treatment outcomes for vulnerable 
      populations.

TI  - Ethical decision-making for AI in mental health: the Integrated Ethical Approach 
      for Computational Psychiatry (IEACP) framework.

AB  - The integration of computational methods into psychiatry presents profound 
      ethical challenges that extend beyond existing guidelines for AI and healthcare. 
      While precision medicine and digital mental health tools offer transformative 
      potential, they also raise concerns about privacy, algorithmic bias, 
      transparency, and the erosion of clinical judgment. This article introduces the 
      Integrated Ethical Approach for Computational Psychiatry (IEACP) framework, 
      developed through a conceptual synthesis of 83 studies. The framework comprises 
      five procedural stages - Identification, Analysis, Decision-making, 
      Implementation, and Review - each informed by six core ethical values - 
      beneficence, autonomy, justice, privacy, transparency, and scientific integrity. 
      By systematically addressing ethical dilemmas inherent in computational 
      psychiatry, the IEACP provides clinicians, researchers, and policymakers with 
      structured decision-making processes that support patient-centered, culturally 
      sensitive, and equitable AI implementation. Through case studies, we demonstrate 
      framework adaptability to real-world applications, underscoring the necessity of 
      ethical innovation alongside technological progress in psychiatric care.

TI  - SigPrimedNet: A Signaling-Informed Neural Network for scRNA-seq Annotation of 
      Known and Unknown Cell Types.
LID - 10.3390/biology12040579 [doi]
LID - 579
AB  - Single-cell RNA sequencing is increasing our understanding of the behavior of 
      complex tissues or organs, by providing unprecedented details on the complex cell 
      type landscape at the level of individual cells. Cell type definition and 
      functional annotation are key steps to understanding the molecular processes 
      behind the underlying cellular communication machinery. However, the exponential 
      growth of scRNA-seq data has made the task of manually annotating cells 
      unfeasible, due not only to an unparalleled resolution of the technology but to 
      an ever-increasing heterogeneity of the data. Many supervised and unsupervised 
      methods have been proposed to automatically annotate cells. Supervised approaches 
      for cell-type annotation outperform unsupervised methods except when new 
      (unknown) cell types are present. Here, we introduce SigPrimedNet an artificial 
      neural network approach that leverages (i) efficient training by means of a 
      sparsity-inducing signaling circuits-informed layer, (ii) feature representation 
      learning through supervised training, and (iii) unknown cell-type identification 
      by fitting an anomaly detection method on the learned representation. We show 
      that SigPrimedNet can efficiently annotate known cell types while keeping a low 
      false-positive rate for unseen cells across a set of publicly available datasets. 
      In addition, the learned representation acts as a proxy for signaling circuit 
      activity measurements, which provide useful estimations of the cell 
      functionalities.

      Across Diverse Healthcare Settings.
PG  - 9803788
LID - 10.1155/joph/9803788 [doi]
LID - 9803788
AB  - Purpose: To propose a conceptual framework for an AI-driven personalized glaucoma 
      progression prediction system that integrates diverse data sources to enhance 
      clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes. This framework is 
      specifically designed to address healthcare disparities in glaucoma care through 
      scalable AI technology that can function across diverse resource settings, from 
      tertiary care centers to remote clinics. The system aims to democratize access to 
      expert-level glaucoma care while addressing challenges of bias, equity, and 
      accessibility. Methods: The paper outlines a comprehensive framework consisting 
      of four main components: (1) data integration and preprocessing, (2) AI model 
      architecture and training, (3) personalized prediction generation, and (4) a 
      clinical decision support interface. The framework leverages multimodal neural 
      networks to analyze structural imaging data, functional test results, clinical 
      measurements, and patient demographics. Results: The proposed framework addresses 
      current limitations in glaucoma progression prediction by capturing complex 
      interactions between various risk factors. Potential benefits include early 
      detection of rapid progressors, optimized treatment strategies, improved patient 
      counseling, and support for clinical research. Implementation challenges such as 
      data quality, model interpretability, workflow integration, regulatory approval, 
      and ethical considerations are discussed along with strategies to address them. 
      Conclusions: The AI-driven framework for glaucoma progression prediction 
      represents a significant advancement in personalized glaucoma management. While 
      challenges remain, the potential benefits in terms of preserved vision, improved 
      quality of life, and more efficient healthcare delivery are substantial. Future 
      research directions include incorporating genetic data, advanced imaging 
      modalities, and federated learning techniques to further enhance the system's 
      capabilities and impact.

TI  - Histopathological Image Analysis and Enhanced Diagnostic Accuracy Explainability 
      for Oral Cancer Detection.
PG  - 1-14
LID - 10.1080/07357907.2025.2559103 [doi]
AB  - Deep learning (DL) has transformed medical imaging, particularly in the realm of 
      Oral Cancer (OC) diagnosis using histopathological images. Timely detection of OC 
      is essential for enhancing precision medicine and saving lives. However, 
      incorrect diagnosis may impede effective treatment. In this study, we have 
      proposed a DL model for OC classification, enhanced diagnosis decision-making, 
      and interpretability. We achieve this by starting with color normalization of 
      histopathology images using the Vahadane Three-Stain Parameter Normalization and 
      watershed segmentation method, followed by tiling and augmentation. Key features 
      are selected using the Weighted Fisher Score (WFS) to address class imbalance. 
      The U-Net classifier has been improved by using feature-based inputs instead of 
      full images, reducing computational complexity and training time. The integration 
      of Vahadane normalization for consistent preprocessing across samples, WFS, and 
      Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) addresses critical challenges in 
      histopathological image analysis. The proposed model surpasses existing 
      approaches with a classification accuracy of 99.54% and outperforms DenseNet201 
      and VGG10 in precision and reliability. The efficiency in handling imbalanced 
      datasets and explainability features make it suitable for early precise OC 
      detection, which can reduce diagnostic errors and enhance treatment outcomes.​.

AB  - Understanding the genetic basis of complex traits is a longstanding challenge in 
      the field of genomics. Genome-wide association studies have identified thousands 
      of variant-trait associations, but most of these variants are located in 
      noncoding regions, making the link to biological function elusive. While 
      traditional approaches, such as transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), 
      have advanced our understanding by linking genetic variants to gene expression, 
      they often overlook gene-gene interactions. Here, we review current approaches to 
      integrate different molecular data, leveraging machine learning methods to 
      identify gene modules based on coexpression and functional relationships. These 
      integrative approaches, such as PhenoPLIER, combine TWAS and drug-induced 
      transcriptional profiles to effectively capture biologically meaningful gene 
      networks. This integration provides a context-specific understanding of disease 
      processes while highlighting both core and peripheral genes. These insights pave 
      the way for novel therapeutic targets and enhance the interpretability of genetic 
      studies in personalized medicine.

PG  - 178-187
LID - 10.1101/gr.279694.124 [doi]
AB  - Polygenic risk score (PRS) is a widely used approach for predicting individuals' 
      genetic risk of complex diseases, playing a pivotal role in advancing precision 
      medicine. Traditional PRS methods, predominantly following a linear structure, 
      often fall short in capturing the intricate relationships between genotype and 
      phenotype. In this study, we present PRS-Net, an interpretable geometric deep 
      learning-based framework that effectively models the nonlinearity of biological 
      systems for enhanced disease prediction and biological discovery. PRS-Net begins 
      by deconvoluting the genome-wide PRS at the single-gene resolution and then 
      explicitly encapsulates gene-gene interactions leveraging a graph neural network 
      (GNN) for genetic risk prediction, enabling a systematic characterization of 
      molecular interplay underpinning diseases. An attentive readout module is 
      introduced to facilitate model interpretation. Extensive tests across multiple 
      complex traits and diseases demonstrate the superior prediction performance of 
      PRS-Net compared with a wide range of conventional PRS methods. The 
      interpretability of PRS-Net further enhances the identification of 
      disease-relevant genes and gene programs. PRS-Net provides a potent tool for 
      concurrent genetic risk prediction and biological discovery for complex diseases.

TI  - Development, Validation, and Clinical Utility of a Nomogram for Urological 
      Tumors: How to Build the Best Predictive Model.
PG  - 919-931
LID - 10.1111/iju.70075 [doi]
AB  - Nomograms are increasingly recognized as indispensable clinical prediction tools, 
      offering individualized risk estimates through interpretable and visually 
      intuitive formats. Their integration into urologic oncology has significantly 
      advanced precision medicine by enabling refined risk stratification for patients 
      with urological malignancies. This review provides a concise yet comprehensive 
      overview of the development, clinical application, and future prospects of 
      nomograms in urologic oncology. We first outline the essential methodological 
      framework for constructing valid prediction models, including outcome definition, 
      predictor selection, model building, and statistical evaluation using 
      discrimination and calibration metrics. Internal validation techniques such as 
      cross-validation and bootstrapping are highlighted as safeguards against 
      overfitting, while external validation is emphasized to ensure generalizability 
      across diverse clinical contexts. Twelve representative nomograms are examined, 
      classified by display type and implementation format, to illustrate their 
      clinical relevance and limitations. While regression-based models remain widely 
      used, emerging approaches incorporating artificial intelligence and machine 
      learning offer enhanced predictive accuracy but pose challenges in 
      interpretability and integration into electronic health records. Interactive 
      decision-support tools are also gaining prominence, promoting real-time, 
      patient-centered care. Despite existing limitations, such as static outputs, 
      dependence on retrospective data, and inconsistent methodological standards, 
      nomograms continue to facilitate precise and evidence-based decision-making. 
      Looking ahead, future models must prioritize transparency, dynamic updating, 
      multimodal data integration, and adherence to established reporting guidelines. 
      Through rigorous development and thoughtful implementation, nomograms will remain 
      pivotal instruments in delivering personalized, high-quality care in urologic 
      oncology.

AB  - Most models for predicting malignant pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous 
      neoplasms were developed based on logistic regression (LR) analysis. Our study 
      aimed to develop risk prediction models using machine learning (ML) and LR 
      techniques and compare their performances. This was a multinational, 
      multi-institutional, retrospective study. Clinical variables including age, sex, 
      main duct diameter, cyst size, mural nodule, and tumour location were factors 
      considered for model development (MD). After the division into a MD set and a 
      test set (2:1), the best ML and LR models were developed by training with the MD 
      set using a tenfold cross validation. The test area under the receiver operating 
      curves (AUCs) of the two models were calculated using an independent test set. A 
      total of 3,708 patients were included. The stacked ensemble algorithm in the ML 
      model and variable combinations containing all variables in the LR model were the 
      most chosen during 200 repetitions. After 200 repetitions, the mean AUCs of the 
      ML and LR models were comparable (0.725 vs. 0.725). The performances of the ML 
      and LR models were comparable. The LR model was more practical than ML 
      counterpart, because of its convenience in clinical use and simple 
      interpretability.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Metabolomics has the promise to transform the area of personalized 
      medicine with the rapid development of high throughput technology for untargeted 
      analysis of metabolites. Open access, easy to use, analytic tools that are 
      broadly accessible to the biological community need to be developed. While 
      technology used in metabolomics varies, most metabolomics studies have a set of 
      features identified. Galaxy is an open access platform that enables scientists at 
      all levels to interact with big data. Galaxy promotes reproducibility by saving 
      histories and enabling the sharing workflows among scientists. RESULTS: 
      SECIMTools (SouthEast Center for Integrated Metabolomics) is a set of Python 
      applications that are available both as standalone tools and wrapped for use in 
      Galaxy. The suite includes a comprehensive set of quality control metrics 
      (retention time window evaluation and various peak evaluation tools), 
      visualization techniques (hierarchical cluster heatmap, principal component 
      analysis, modular modularity clustering), basic statistical analysis methods 
      (partial least squares - discriminant analysis, analysis of variance, t-test, 
      Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test), advanced classification methods (random 
      forest, support vector machines), and advanced variable selection tools (least 
      absolute shrinkage and selection operator LASSO and Elastic Net). CONCLUSIONS: 
      SECIMTools leverages the Galaxy platform and enables integrated workflows for 
      metabolomics data analysis made from building blocks designed for easy use and 
      interpretability. Standard data formats and a set of utilities allow arbitrary 
      linkages between tools to encourage novel workflow designs. The Galaxy framework 
      enables future data integration for metabolomics studies with other omics data.

AB  - Multi-modal medical image fusion (MMIF) is increasingly recognized as an 
      essential technique for enhancing diagnostic precision and facilitating effective 
      clinical decision-making within computer-aided diagnosis systems. MMIF combines 
      data from X-ray, MRI, CT, PET, SPECT, and ultrasound to create detailed, 
      clinically useful images of patient anatomy and pathology. These integrated 
      representations significantly advance diagnostic accuracy, lesion detection, and 
      segmentation. This comprehensive review meticulously surveys the evolution, 
      methodologies, algorithms, current advancements, and clinical applications of 
      MMIF. We present a critical comparative analysis of traditional fusion 
      approaches, including pixel-, feature-, and decision-level methods, and delves 
      into recent advancements driven by deep learning, generative models, and 
      transformer-based architectures. A critical comparative analysis is presented 
      between these conventional methods and contemporary techniques, highlighting 
      differences in robustness, computational efficiency, and interpretability. The 
      article addresses extensive clinical applications across oncology, neurology, and 
      cardiology, demonstrating MMIF's vital role in precision medicine through 
      improved patient-specific therapeutic outcomes. Moreover, the review thoroughly 
      investigates the persistent challenges affecting MMIF's broad adoption, including 
      issues related to data privacy, heterogeneity, computational complexity, 
      interpretability of AI-driven algorithms, and integration within clinical 
      workflows. It also identifies significant future research avenues, such as the 
      integration of explainable AI, adoption of privacy-preserving federated learning 
      frameworks, development of real-time fusion systems, and standardization efforts 
      for regulatory compliance. This review organizes key knowledge, outlines 
      challenges, and highlights opportunities, guiding researchers, clinicians, and 
      developers in advancing MMIF for routine clinical use and promoting personalized 
      healthcare. To support further research, we provide a GitHub repository that 
      includes popular multi-modal medical imaging datasets along with recent models in 
      our shared GitHub repository.

AB  - Immunotherapy holds promise in enhancing pathological complete response rates in 
      breast cancer, albeit confined to a select cohort of patients. Consequently, 
      pinpointing factors predictive of treatment responsiveness is of paramount 
      importance. Gene expression and regulation, inherently operating within intricate 
      networks, constitute fundamental molecular machinery for cellular processes and 
      often serve as robust biomarkers. Nevertheless, contemporary feature selection 
      approaches grapple with two key challenges: opacity in modeling and scarcity in 
      accounting for gene-gene interactions METHODS: To address these limitations, we 
      devise a novel feature selection methodology grounded in cooperative game theory, 
      harmoniously integrating with sophisticated machine learning models. This 
      approach identifies interconnected gene regulatory network biomarker modules with 
      priori genetic linkage architecture. Specifically, we leverage Shapley values on 
      network to quantify feature importance, while strategically constraining their 
      integration based on network expansion principles and nodal adjacency, thereby 
      fostering enhanced interpretability in feature selection. We apply our methods to 
      a publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing dataset of breast cancer 
      immunotherapy responses, using the identified feature gene set as biomarkers. 
      Functional enrichment analysis with independent validations further illustrates 
      their effective predictive performance RESULTS: We demonstrate the sophistication 
      and excellence of the proposed method in data with network structure. It unveiled 
      a cohesive biomarker module encompassing 27 genes for immunotherapy response. 
      Notably, this module proves adept at precisely predicting anti-PD1 therapeutic 
      outcomes in breast cancer patients with classification accuracy of 0.905 and AUC 
      value of 0.971, underscoring its unique capacity to illuminate gene 
      functionalities CONCLUSION: The proposed method is effective for identifying 
      network module biomarkers, and the detected anti-PD1 response biomarkers can 
      enrich our understanding of the underlying physiological mechanisms of 
      immunotherapy, which have a promising application for realizing precision 
      medicine.

AB  - Machine learning methods, especially Transformer architectures, have been widely 
      employed in single-cell omics studies. However, interpretability and accurate 
      representation of out-of-distribution (OOD) cells remains challenging. Inspired 
      by the global workspace theory in cognitive neuroscience, we introduce 
      CellMemory, a bottlenecked Transformer with improved generalizability designed 
      for the hierarchical interpretation of OOD cells. Without pre-training, 
      CellMemory outperforms existing single-cell foundation models and accurately 
      deciphers spatial transcriptomics at high resolution. Leveraging its robust 
      representations, we further elucidate malignant cells and their founder cells 
      across patients, providing reliable characterizations of the cellular changes 
      caused by the disease.

AB  - Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is an emerging non-invasive medical imaging 
      tomography technology based on magnetic particles, with excellent imaging depth 
      penetration, high sensitivity and contrast. Spatial resolution and 
      signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are key performance metrics for evaluating MPI, which 
      are directly influenced by the gradient of the selection field (SF). Increasing 
      the SF gradient can improve the spatial resolution of MPI, but will lead to a 
      decrease in SNR. Deep learning (DL) methods may enable obtaining high-resolution 
      images from low-resolution images to improve the MPI resolution under low 
      gradient conditions. However, existing DL methods overlook the physical 
      procedures contributing to the blurring of MPI images, resulting in low 
      interpretability and hindering breakthroughs in resolution. To address this 
      issue, we propose a dual-channel end-to-end network with prior knowledge 
      embedding for MPI (DENPK-MPI) to effectively establish a latent mapping between 
      low-gradient and high-gradient images, thus improving MPI resolution without 
      compromising SNR. By seamlessly integrating MPI PSF with DL paradigm, DENPK-MPI 
      leads to a significant improvement in spatial resolution performance. Simulation, 
      phantom, and in vivo MPI experiments have collectively confirmed that our method 
      can improve the resolution of low-gradient MPI images without sacrificing SNR, 
      resulting in a decrease in full width at half maximum by 14.8%-23.8 %, and the 
      accuracy of image reconstruction is 18.2 %-27.3 % higher than other DL methods. 
      In conclusion, we propose a DL method that incorporates MPI prior knowledge, 
      which can improve the spatial resolution of MPI without compromising SNR and 
      possess improved biomedical application.

AB  - Despite advances in precision oncology, developing effective cancer therapeutics 
      remains a significant challenge due to tumor heterogeneity and the limited 
      availability of well-defined drug targets. Recent progress in generative 
      artificial intelligence (AI) offers a promising opportunity to address this 
      challenge by enabling the design of hit-like anti-cancer molecules conditioned on 
      complex genomic features. We present Genotype-to-Drug Diffusion (G2D-Diff), a 
      generative AI approach for creating small molecule-based drug structures tailored 
      to specific cancer genotypes. G2D-Diff demonstrates exceptional performance in 
      generating diverse, drug-like compounds that meet desired efficacy conditions for 
      a given genotype. The model outperforms existing methods in diversity, 
      feasibility, and condition fitness. G2D-Diff learns directly from drug response 
      data distributions, ensuring reliable candidate generation without separate 
      predictors. Its attention mechanism provides insights into potential cancer 
      targets and pathways, enhancing interpretability. In triple-negative breast 
      cancer case studies, G2D-Diff generated plausible hit-like candidates by focusing 
      on relevant pathways. By combining realistic hit-like molecule generation with 
      relevant pathway suggestions for specific genotypes, G2D-Diff represents a 
      significant advance in AI-guided, personalized drug discovery. This approach has 
      the potential to accelerate drug development for challenging cancers by 
      streamlining hit identification.

TI  - Personalizing Seizure Detection for Individual Patients by Optimal Selection of 
      EEG Signals.
LID - 10.3390/s25092715 [doi]
LID - 2715
AB  - Electroencephalography is a widely used non-invasive method for monitoring brain 
      electrical activity, critical for diagnosing and managing neurological disorders 
      such as epilepsy. While clinical standards use 21 electrodes to capture 
      comprehensive neural signals, a personalized approach can enhance performance by 
      selecting patient-specific channels, reducing noise and redundancy. This study 
      introduces an innovative, lightweight deep learning system optimized for 
      real-time seizure detection in personalized wearable devices. The system uses an 
      efficient Convolutional Neural Network that processes data from just two 
      channels. These channels are automatically selected using a data-driven mechanism 
      that identifies the most informative scalp regions based on each patient's unique 
      seizure patterns. The proposed approach ensures high reliability, even with small 
      datasets, and improves interpretability for clinicians by overcoming the 
      limitations of more complex methods. The tailored channel selection boosts 
      detection accuracy and ensures robust performance across different seizure types 
      while reducing the computational burden typical of multi-electrode systems. 
      Validation on the publicly available CHB-MIT dataset achieved an average balanced 
      accuracy of 0.83 and a false-positive rate of approximately 0.1/h. The system's 
      performance matches, and in some cases outperforms, state-of-the-art systems that 
      use four fixed channels in temporal regions, demonstrating the potential of 
      two-channel wearable solutions, specifically with a non-negligible 30% reduction 
      in the false-positive rate. This interpretable, patient-specific method enables 
      the development of personalized, efficient, and compact wearable devices for 
      reliable seizure detection in everyday life.

      effective programs but raise important questions regarding user safety, security, 
      health, transparency, and privacy. The Personalized Nutrition Initiative at the 
      University of Illinois held the workshop, "Challenges for Personalized Nutrition 
      in the Current United States Regulatory Framework and Future Opportunities," to 
      address regulatory implications of current PN programs, future innovation within 
      the current framework, and existing complexities of oversight. A majority of PN 
      programs combine multiple components, and these components may need to be 
      regulated differently. The areas of food, supplements, in vitro diagnostics, and 
      medical and wellness devices were described and discussed as they apply to PN 
      programs. The speakers and discussants concluded that regulatory guidance for PN 
      programs should focus on ensuring 1) safety and accuracy of the tests and 
      devices, 2) credentialed and skilled experts develop the advice, 3) responsible 
      and clear communication of information and benefits, 4) substantiation of 
      scientific claims, and 5) procedures are implemented to protect user privacy. 
      Furthermore, as this field incorporates new devices, biomarkers, behavior-based 
      tools, and the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning, the 
      need to adapt the existing regulatory framework was also considered. Working 
      closely with regulatory bodies is required and should be an opportunity to 
      provide users with transparency, build trust, and create a source of 
      differentiation for PN innovators.

TI  - Leveraging Neural ODEs for Population Pharmacokinetics of Dalbavancin in Sparse 
      Clinical Data.
LID - 10.3390/e27060602 [doi]
LID - 602
AB  - This study investigates the use of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) 
      as an alternative to traditional compartmental models and Nonlinear Mixed-Effects 
      (NLME) models for drug concentration prediction in pharmacokinetics. Unlike 
      standard models that rely on strong assumptions and often struggle with 
      high-dimensional covariate relationships, NODEs offer a data-driven approach, 
      learning differential equations directly from data while integrating covariates. 
      To evaluate their performance, NODEs were applied to a real-world Dalbavancin 
      pharmacokinetic dataset comprising 218 patients and compared against a 
      two-compartment model and an NLME within a cross-validation framework, which 
      ensures an evaluation of robustness. Given the challenge of limited data 
      availability, a data augmentation strategy was employed to pre-train NODEs. Their 
      predictive performance was assessed both with and without covariates, while model 
      explainability was analyzed using Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) values. 
      Results show that, in the absence of covariates, NODEs performed comparably to 
      state-of-the-art NLME models. However, when covariates were incorporated, NODEs 
      demonstrated superior predictive accuracy. SHAP analyses further revealed how 
      NODEs leverage covariates in their predictions. These results establish NODEs as 
      a promising alternative for pharmacokinetic modeling, particularly in capturing 
      complex covariate interactions, even when dealing with sparse and small datasets, 
      thus paving the way for improved drug concentration predictions and personalized 
      treatment strategies in precision medicine.

TI  - NetActivity enhances transcriptional signals by combining gene expression into 
      robust gene set activity scores through interpretable autoencoders.
PG  - e44
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkae197 [doi]
AB  - Grouping gene expression into gene set activity scores (GSAS) provides better 
      biological insights than studying individual genes. However, existing gene set 
      projection methods cannot return representative, robust, and interpretable GSAS. 
      We developed NetActivity, a machine learning framework that generates GSAS based 
      on a sparsely-connected autoencoder, where each neuron in the inner layer 
      represents a gene set. We proposed a three-tier training that yielded 
      representative, robust, and interpretable GSAS. NetActivity model was trained 
      with 1518 GO biological processes terms and KEGG pathways and all GTEx samples. 
      NetActivity generates GSAS robust to the initialization parameters and 
      representative of the original transcriptome, and assigned higher importance to 
      more biologically relevant genes. Moreover, NetActivity returns GSAS with a more 
      consistent definition and higher interpretability than GSVA and hipathia, 
      state-of-the-art gene set projection methods. Finally, NetActivity enables 
      combining bulk RNA-seq and microarray datasets in a meta-analysis of prostate 
      cancer progression, highlighting gene sets related to cell division, key for 
      disease progression. When applied to metastatic prostate cancer, gene sets 
      associated with cancer progression were also altered due to drug resistance, 
      while a classical enrichment analysis identified gene sets irrelevant to the 
      phenotype. NetActivity is publicly available in Bioconductor and GitHub.

AB  - Spatial cellular profiling technologies have revolutionized our understanding of 
      complex biological processes, from development and disease progression to 
      immunity and aging. Despite their promise, integrating spatial information with 
      multiplexed molecular data to accurately predict phenotypes poses significant 
      challenges, especially in clinical settings. Here, we present SORBET, a geometric 
      deep learning framework that directly analyzes complete spatial profiling data, 
      eliminating the need to compress complete cell profiles into a limited set of 
      annotations, such as cell types. SORBET models tissues as graphs of adjacent 
      cells and applies graph convolutional networks to infer emergent phenotypes, such 
      as responses to immunotherapy. The model leverages a novel data augmentation 
      technique to ensure robust predictions, complemented by tailored interpretability 
      analyses to identify the molecular and spatial patterns underlying the model's 
      phenotype inferences. We apply our method to a CosMx spatial transcriptomics 
      dataset of pre-treatment metastatic melanoma samples annotated with response to 
      immunotherapy; we show that spatial information significantly improves clinical 
      endpoint, or phenotype, prediction and identifies important biological patterns. 
      To our knowledge, SORBET is the first example of phenotype prediction on spatial 
      transcriptomics data. We further validated our method using two spatial 
      proteomics datasets, Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) and Co-detection by indexing 
      (CODEX), obtained from Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer and Colorectal Cancer samples, 
      respectively. SORBET demonstrates superior accuracy in phenotype prediction over 
      leading spatial and non-spatial methods across various datasets of different 
      observed phenotypes and technologies. SORBET sets a new benchmark for predictive 
      analysis in spatial omics, promising to advance personalized medicine through 
      refined patient treatment stratification, grounded in molecular and spatial 
      tissue profiling.

TI  - MediBoost: a Patient Stratification Tool for Interpretable Decision Making in the 
      Era of Precision Medicine.

AB  - Machine learning algorithms that are both interpretable and accurate are 
      essential in applications such as medicine where errors can have a dire 
      consequence. Unfortunately, there is currently a tradeoff between accuracy and 
      interpretability among state-of-the-art methods. Decision trees are interpretable 
      and are therefore used extensively throughout medicine for stratifying patients. 
      Current decision tree algorithms, however, are consistently outperformed in 
      accuracy by other, less-interpretable machine learning models, such as ensemble 
      methods. We present MediBoost, a novel framework for constructing decision trees 
      that retain interpretability while having accuracy similar to ensemble methods, 
      and compare MediBoost's performance to that of conventional decision trees and 
      ensemble methods on 13 medical classification problems. MediBoost significantly 
      outperformed current decision tree algorithms in 11 out of 13 problems, giving 
      accuracy comparable to ensemble methods. The resulting trees are of the same type 
      as decision trees used throughout clinical practice but have the advantage of 
      improved accuracy. Our algorithm thus gives the best of both worlds: it grows a 
      single, highly interpretable tree that has the high accuracy of ensemble methods.

      predicting Drug-Drug interaction events.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the medical context where polypharmacy is increasingly common, 
      accurately predicting drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is necessary for enhancing 
      clinical medication safety and personalized treatment. Despite progress in 
      identifying potential DDIs, a deep understanding of the underlying mechanisms of 
      DDIs remains limited, constraining the rapid development and clinical application 
      of new drugs. METHODS: This study introduces a novel multimodal drug-drug 
      interaction (MMDDI) model based on multi-source drug data and comprehensive 
      feature fusion techniques, aiming to improve the accuracy and depth of DDI 
      prediction. We utilized the real-world DrugBank dataset, which contains rich drug 
      information. Our task was to predict multiple interaction events between drug 
      pairs and analyze the underlying mechanisms of these interactions. The MMDDI 
      model achieves precise predictions through four key stages: feature extraction, 
      drug pairing strategy, fusion network, and multi-source feature integration. We 
      employed advanced data fusion techniques and machine learning algorithms for 
      multidimensional analysis of drug features and interaction events. RESULTS: The 
      MMDDI model was comprehensively evaluated on three representative prediction 
      tasks. Experimental results demonstrated that the MMDDI model outperforms 
      existing technologies in terms of predictive accuracy, generalization ability, 
      and interpretability. Specifically, the MMDDI model achieved an accuracy of 93% 
      on the test set, and the area under the AUC-ROC curve reached 0.9505, showing 
      excellent predictive performance. Furthermore, the model's interpretability 
      analysis revealed the complex relationships between drug features and interaction 
      mechanisms, providing new insights for clinical medication decisions. CONCLUSION: 
      The MMDDI model not only improves the accuracy of DDI prediction but also 
      provides significant scientific support for clinical medication safety and drug 
      development by deeply analyzing the mechanisms of drug interactions. These 
      findings have the potential to improve patient medication outcomes and contribute 
      to the development of personalized medicine.

AB  - As biotechnology and computer science continue to advance, there's a growing 
      amount of biomedical data worldwide. However, standardizing and consolidating 
      these data remains challenging, making analysis and comprehension more difficult. 
      To enhance research on complex diseases like myocardial infarction (MI), an 
      ontology is necessary to ensure consistent data labeling and knowledge 
      representation. This will facilitate data management and the application of 
      artificial intelligence techniques in this field, ultimately advancing precision 
      medicine research for MI. This study introduced the MI Ontology (MIO), which was 
      developed using Stanford's seven-step method and Protégé. MIO aims to support 
      precision medicine research on MI by effectively modeling and representing 
      MI-related concepts and relationships. The validation of the MIO model involved 
      employing Ontology Web Language (OWL) reasoners and comparing it with other 
      disease-specific ontologies. MIO is an ontology model comprising of 3090 classes, 
      14 object attributes, 3494 individuals, 9415 synonyms and 49263 axioms, which 
      encompass knowledge related to MI such as anatomical entities, clinical findings, 
      drugs, genes, influencing factors, pathogenesis, patients-related concepts, 
      procedures, and disease types. Furthermore, MIO has passed logical consistency 
      validation and exhibits a broader conceptual scope and deeper knowledge structure 
      than other disease-specific ontologies. Additionally, clinical use scenarios for 
      MIO were developed to help address specific clinical problems. This study 
      constructed the first comprehensive disease-specific ontology in cardiovascular 
      diseases, named MIO, to promote precision medicine research on MI. MIO integrates 
      and standardizes medical data, addressing complexity and standardization 
      challenges. This promotes the use of big data analysis, explainable AI, and deep 
      phenotype research in precision medicine. Future efforts will focus on enhancing 
      and expanding MIO's applicability and scalability for superior services in this 
      field.

TI  - ExplainMIX: Explaining Drug Response Prediction in Directed Graph Neural Networks 
      With Multi-Omics Fusion.
PG  - 5339-5349
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2025.3550353 [doi]
AB  - The intricacies of cancer present formidable challenges in achieving effective 
      treatments. Despite extensive research in computational methods for drug response 
      prediction, achieving personalized treatment insights remains challenging. 
      Emerging solutions combine multiple omics data, leveraging graph neural networks 
      to integrate molecular interactions into the reasoning process. However, 
      effectively modeling and harnessing this information, as well as gaining the 
      trust of clinical professionals remain complex. This paper introduces ExplainMIX, 
      a pioneering approach that utilizes directed graph neural networks to predict 
      drug responses with interpretability. ExplainMIX adeptly captures intricate 
      structures and features within directed heterogeneous graphs, leveraging diverse 
      data modalities such as genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. ExplainMIX goes 
      beyond prediction by generating transparent and interpretable explanations. 
      Incorporating edge-level, meta-path, and graph structure information, it provides 
      meaningful insights into factors influencing drug response, supporting clinicians 
      and researchers in the development of targeted therapies. Empirical results 
      validate the efficacy of ExplainMIX in prediction and interpretation tasks by 
      constructing a quantitative evaluation ground truth. This approach aims to 
      contribute to precision medicine research by addressing challenges in 
      interpretable personalized drug response prediction within the landscape of 
      cancer.

TI  - Optimizing tacrolimus dosage in post-renal transplantation using DoseOptimal 
      framework: profiling CYP3A5 genetic variants for interpretability.
PG  - 1042-1052
LID - 10.1007/s11096-025-01899-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Achieving optimal tacrolimus dosing is vital for effectively 
      balancing therapeutic efficacy and safety, as CYP3A5 genetic variants and 
      inter-patient variability emphasize the need for precision strategies. AIM: This 
      study aimed to optimize tacrolimus dosage prediction for renal transplant 
      recipients by incorporating genetic polymorphisms, specifically profiling CYP3A5 
      genetic variants, within the DoseOptimal framework to enhance interpretability 
      and accuracy of dosing decisions. METHOD: The dataset comprised clinical, 
      demographic, and CYP3A5 genetic variants information from 1045 stable 
      tacrolimus-treated patients. The DoseOptimal framework was developed by 
      integrating the strengths of the most effective algorithms from fifteen machine 
      learning models. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and decision tree insights 
      were incorporated to enhance the framework's interpretability. The framework's 
      performance was assessed using mean absolute error (MAE) and the coefficient of 
      determination (R(2) score). The F-statistic and p value were calculated to 
      validate the framework's statistical significance. RESULTS: The DoseOptimal 
      framework demonstrated robust performance with an R(2) score of 0.884 in the 
      training set and 0.830 in the testing set. The MAE was 0.40 mg/day (95% CI 
      0.38-0.43) in the training set and 0.41 mg/day (95% CI 0.38-0.45) in the testing 
      set. The framework predicted the ideal tacrolimus dosage in 87.6% (n = 275) of 
      the test cohort, with 3.2% (n = 10) underestimation and 9.2% (n = 29) 
      overestimation. The framework's statistical significance was confirmed with an 
      F-statistic of 266.095 and a p value < 0.001. CONCLUSION: The framework provides 
      precision medicine-based dosing solutions tailored to individual genetic 
      profiles, minimizing dosing errors and enhancing patient outcomes.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) technology enhances the function of acupuncture 
      clinical decision support system (CDSS) by promoting the accuracy of its 
      diagnosis, assisting the formulation of personalized therapeutic regimen, and 
      realizing the scientific and precise evaluation of its therapeutic effect. This 
      paper deeply analyzes the unique advantages of AI-based acupuncture CDSS, 
      including the intelligence and high efficiency. Besides, it points out the 
      challenges of data security, the lack of model interpretation and the complexity 
      of interdisciplinary cooperation in the development of acupuncture CDSS. With the 
      continuous development and improvement of AI technology, acupuncture CDSS is 
      expected to play a more important role in the fields of personalized medicine, 
      telemedicine and disease prevention, and to further advance the efficiency and 
      effect of acupuncture treatment, drive the modernization of acupuncture, and 
      enhance its position and influence in the global healthcare system.

TI  - IDMIL: an alignment-free Interpretable Deep Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) for 
      predicting disease from whole-metagenomic data.
PG  - i39-i47
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa477 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: The human body hosts more microbial organisms than human cells. 
      Analysis of this microbial diversity provides key insight into the role played by 
      these microorganisms on human health. Metagenomics is the collective DNA 
      sequencing of coexisting microbial organisms in an environmental sample or a 
      host. This has several applications in precision medicine, agriculture, 
      environmental science and forensics. State-of-the-art predictive models for 
      phenotype predictions from metagenomic data rely on alignments, assembly, 
      extensive pruning, taxonomic profiling and reference sequence databases. These 
      processes are time consuming and they do not consider novel microbial sequences 
      when aligned with the reference genome, limiting the potential of whole 
      metagenomics. We formulate the problem of predicting human disease from 
      whole-metagenomic data using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), a popular 
      supervised learning paradigm. Our proposed alignment-free approach provides 
      higher accuracy in prediction by harnessing the capability of deep convolutional 
      neural network (CNN) within a MIL framework and provides interpretability via 
      neural attention mechanism. RESULTS: The MIL formulation combined with the 
      hierarchical feature extraction capability of deep-CNN provides significantly 
      better predictive performance compared to popular existing approaches. The 
      attention mechanism allows for the identification of groups of sequences that are 
      likely to be correlated to diseases providing the much-needed interpretation. Our 
      proposed approach does not rely on alignment, assembly and reference sequence 
      databases; making it fast and scalable for large-scale metagenomic data. We 
      evaluate our method on well-known large-scale metagenomic studies and show that 
      our proposed approach outperforms comparative state-of-the-art methods for 
      disease prediction. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION:

TI  - GatorCLR: Personalized predictions of patient outcomes on electronic health 
      records using self-supervised contrastive graph representation.

LID - S1532-0464(25)00080-2 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jbi.2025.104851 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Recently, there has been growing interest in analyzing large amounts 
      of Electronic Health Record (EHR) data. Patient outcome prediction is a major 
      area of interest in EHR analysis that focuses on predicting the future health 
      status of patients using structured data types, such as diagnoses, medications, 
      and procedures collected from longitudinal EHR data. We investigate and design 
      self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigms to learn high-quality representations 
      from longitudinal EHR data, aiming to effectively capture longitudinal 
      relationships and patterns for improved patient outcome predictions. METHODS: We 
      propose an end-to-end, novel, and robust model called GatorCLR that aligns with 
      the contrastive SSL paradigm. GatorCLR incorporates graph analysis-based patient 
      modeling into longitudinal EHR data, generating graph representations of nodes 
      and edges representing patients, their relationships, and similarities. A 
      two-layer augmentation technique is further incorporated in our GatorCLR that 
      generates consistent, identity-preserving augmentations from graph 
      representations. RESULTS: We evaluate our approach using real-world EHR datasets. 
      Experimental results indicate that our GatorCLR delivers meaningful and robust 
      performance across multiple clinical tasks and datasets and provides transparency 
      of the model decisions. CONCLUSION: The proposed approach presents a significant 
      step toward developing a foundation model with longitudinal EHR data, capable of 
      making informed predictions and adaptable to various downstream use cases and 
      tasks. This study should, therefore, be of value to practitioners wishing to 
      leverage longitudinal EHR data for predictive analytics.

TI  - Transformer with convolution and graph-node co-embedding: An accurate and 
      interpretable vision backbone for predicting gene expressions from local 
      histopathological image.

AB  - Inferring gene expressions from histopathological images has long been a 
      fascinating yet challenging task, primarily due to the substantial disparities 
      between the two modality. Existing strategies using local or global features of 
      histological images are suffering model complexity, GPU consumption, low 
      interpretability, insufficient encoding of local features, and over-smooth 
      prediction of gene expressions among neighboring sites. In this paper, we develop 
      TCGN (Transformer with Convolution and Graph-Node co-embedding method) for gene 
      expression estimation from H&E-stained pathological slide images. TCGN comprises 
      a combination of convolutional layers, transformer encoders, and graph neural 
      networks, and is the first to integrate these blocks in a general and 
      interpretable computer vision backbone. Notably, TCGN uniquely operates with just 
      a single spot image as input for histopathological image analysis, simplifying 
      the process while maintaining interpretability. We validate TCGN on three 
      publicly available spatial transcriptomic datasets. TCGN consistently exhibited 
      the best performance (with median PCC 0.232). TCGN offers superior accuracy while 
      keeping parameters to a minimum (just 86.241 million), and it consumes minimal 
      memory, allowing it to run smoothly even on personal computers. Moreover, TCGN 
      can be extended to handle bulk RNA-seq data while providing the interpretability. 
      Enhancing the accuracy of omics information prediction from pathological images 
      not only establishes a connection between genotype and phenotype, enabling the 
      prediction of costly-to-measure biomarkers from affordable histopathological 
      images, but also lays the groundwork for future multi-modal data modeling. Our 
      results confirm that TCGN is a powerful tool for inferring gene expressions from 
      histopathological images in precision health applications.

AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To develop an interpretable machine learning (ML) model 
      based on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) multimodal parameters and clinical data 
      to discriminate Takotsubo syndrome (TTS), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and 
      acute myocarditis (AM), and to further assess the diagnostic value of right 
      ventricular (RV) strain in TTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study analyzed CMR 
      and clinical data of 130 patients from three centers. Key features were selected 
      using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression and random 
      forest. Data were split into a training cohort and an internal testing cohort 
      (ITC) in the ratio 7:3, with overfitting avoided using leave-one-out 
      cross-validation and bootstrap methods. Nine ML models were evaluated using 
      standard performance metrics, with Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) analysis 
      used for model interpretation. RESULTS: A total of 11 key features were 
      identified. The extreme gradient boosting model showed the best performance, with 
      an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.85-0.97) in the ITC. Right 
      ventricular basal circumferential strain (RVCS-basal) was the most important 
      feature for identifying TTS. Its absolute value was significantly higher in TTS 
      patients than in AMI and AM patients (-9.93%, -5.21%, and -6.18%, respectively, p 
      < 0.001), with values above -6.55% contributing to a diagnosis of TTS. 
      CONCLUSION: This study developed an interpretable ternary classification ML model 
      for identifying TTS and used SHAP analysis to elucidate the significant value of 
      RVCS-basal in TTS diagnosis. An online calculator 
      (https://lsszxyy.shinyapps.io/XGboost/) based on this model was developed to 
      provide immediate decision support for clinical use.

AB  - The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven diagnostics and 
      wearable health technologies is transforming health care delivery by enabling 
      real-time health monitoring and early disease detection. These innovations are 
      catalyzing a shift toward personalized medicine, with interventions tailored to 
      individual patient profiles with unprecedented precision. This paper examines the 
      current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) evidence 
      standards framework (ESF) for digital health technologies (DHTs) and evaluates 
      the challenges associated with integrating DHTs into existing health and care 
      systems. A comprehensive review of the NICE ESF guidelines was conducted, 
      alongside an evaluation of their applicability to emerging AI and wearable 
      technologies. Key limitations and barriers were identified, with particular focus 
      on the framework's responsiveness to technologies that evolve through machine 
      learning and real-world data integration. Our findings indicate that while the 
      NICE ESF provides a structured approach for evaluating DHTs, it lacks the 
      adaptability required for rapidly evolving innovations. The framework does not 
      sufficiently incorporate real-world evidence or support continuous learning 
      models, which are critical for the safe and effective deployment of AI-based 
      diagnostics and wearables. To remain effective and relevant, the NICE ESF should 
      transition to a dynamic, adaptive model co-designed with industry stakeholders. 
      By embedding real-world evidence-based strategies and promoting transparency, 
      efficiency, and collaborative innovation, the updated framework would better 
      facilitate the integration of AI-driven diagnostics and wearables into health 
      care systems, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes and optimizing health care 
      delivery.

TI  - Evidence Based Gait Analysis Interpretation Tools (EB-GAIT) treatment 
      recommendation and outcome prediction models to support decision-making based on 
      clinical gait analysis data.
PG  - e0328036
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0328036 [doi]
LID - e0328036
AB  - Clinical gait analysis (CGA) has historically relied on clinician experience and 
      judgment, leading to modest, stagnant, and unpredictable outcomes. This paper 
      introduces Evidence-Based Gait Analysis Interpretation Tools (EB-GAIT), a novel 
      framework leveraging machine learning to support treatment decisions. The core of 
      EB-GAIT consists of two key components: (1) treatment recommendation models, 
      which are models that estimate the probability of specific surgeries based on 
      historical standard-of-practice (SOP), and (2) treatment outcome models, which 
      predict changes in patient characteristics following treatment or natural 
      history. Using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART), we developed and 
      validated treatment recommendation models for 12 common surgeries that account 
      for more than 95% of the surgery recorded in our CGA center's database. These 
      models demonstrated high balanced accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. We used 
      Shapley values for the models to enhances interpretability and allow clinicians 
      and patients to understand the factors driving treatment recommendations. We also 
      developed treatment outcome models for over 20 common outcome measures. These 
      models were found to be unbiased, with reliable prediction intervals and accuracy 
      comparable to experimental measurement error. We illustrated the application of 
      EB-GAIT through a case study, showcasing its utility in providing treatment 
      recommendations and outcome predictions. We then use simulations to show that 
      combining recommendation and outcome models offers the possibility to improve 
      outcomes for treated limbs, maintain outcomes for untreated limbs, and reduce the 
      number of surgeries performed. For example, under the counterfactual situation 
      where femoral derotation osteotomies are administered only when they align with 
      historical standard of practice (> 50% probability of surgery) and are predicted 
      to improve the Gait Deviation Index (change > 7.5 points), the model predicts a 
      11 percentage point reduction in surgeries (26% limbs currently, 15% limbs 
      simulated), a 6 point improvement in Gait Deviation Index among treated limbs (6 
      currently, 12 simulated), and no change in Gait Deviation Index for untreated 
      limbs (2 currently, 2 simulated). EB-GAIT represents a significant step toward 
      precision medicine in CGA, offering a promising tool to enhance treatment 
      outcomes and patient care. The EB-GAIT approach addresses the limitations of the 
      conventional CGA interpretation method, offering a more structured and 
      data-driven decision-making process. EB-GAIT is not intended to replace clinical 
      judgment but to supplement it, providing clinicians with a second opinion 
      grounded in historical data and predictive analytics. While the models perform 
      well, their effectiveness is constrained by historical variability in treatment 
      decisions and the inherent complexity of patient outcomes. Future efforts should 
      focus on refining model inputs, incorporating surgical details, and pooling data 
      from multiple centers to improve generalizability.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has become a serious health threat globally. 
      However, the existing approaches for diabetes prediction mainly had difficulty in 
      addressing multiple time-series features. This study aims to provide an 
      adjunctive tool for the clinical identification of patients in 
      physician-pharmacist collaborative clinics at high risk of poor prognosis. 
      METHODS: This study proposes a novel interpretable time-series Neural Turing 
      Machine (ITS-NTM) to form patient characteristics into feature matrixes to 
      simulate one's disease and treatment process, predicting the prognosis of 
      patients with T2D and alerting early interventions. Model robustness was verified 
      by 10-fold cross-validation, external validation and multi-model comparisons. We 
      also conducted dynamic prediction and feature importance analysis to explore its 
      interpretability. RESULTS: The study population included patients with T2D 
      attending physician-pharmacist collaborative clinics over 12 months in primary 
      healthcare centers, while clinical features and behavioral indicators at 
      baseline, 3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th months were used to reflect the fluctuation of 
      disease control over time. Compared with five state-of-the-art prediction models, 
      the ITS-NTM obtains 92.0 % in accuracy and 91.8 % F1-score, demonstrating the 
      superiority performance. Feature importance demonstrated that the top 5 features 
      were glycosylated hemoglobin, fasting blood glucose, medication adherence scores, 
      2-hour postprandial blood glucose and waist-to-hip ratio, which had the greatest 
      impact on the performance of the predictive model. CONCLUSIONS: Proposed ITS-NTM 
      could be used to promote the implementation of physician-pharmacist collaborative 
      clinics, and further prompt the application of artificial intelligence to 
      optimize the allocation of medical resources and improve the quality of care in 
      under-resourced areas.

TI  - Explainable Reasoning Path Inference of Anti-cancer Drug Sensitivity on Genomic 
      Knowledge Graph via Macro-Micro Agent Collaborative Reinforcement Learning.
LID - 10.1109/TCBBIO.2025.3607142 [doi]
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) based anticancer drug recommendation systems have 
      emerged as powerful tools for precision dosing. Although existing methods have 
      advanced in terms of predictive accuracy, they encounter three significant 
      obstacles, including the "black-box" problem resulting in unexplainable 
      reasoning, the computational difficulty for graphbased structures, and the 
      combinatorial explosion during multistep reasoning. To tackle these issues, we 
      introduce a novel Macro-Micro agent Drug sensitivity inference (MarMirDrug). 
      Specifically, our methodology enhances interpretability via knowledge graphs 
      (KG). To reduce computational overhead, our MarMirDrug also transforms the graph 
      structures of KG into low-dimensional embeddings. To manage the combinatorial 
      explosion of graph paths that occurs with increasing inference steps, we 
      incorporate a macro-micro dual-agent reinforcement learning algorithm, and 
      combines reinforcement learning with KG-based reasoning to infer path reasoning. 
      In computational experimental outcomes, the efficiency of our embedding model 
      surpasses that of the baseline model, achieving an average improvement of 117.65% 
      for hit score. Also, our dual-agent framework exhibits superior performance and 
      interpretability in drug response prediction, with AUC values outperforming 
      conventional baseline methods. In summary, our approach integrates 
      interpretability, computational efficiency, and predictive accuracy, providing 
      novel contributions to precision medicine. The source code and data of MarMirDrug 
      are available at https://github.com/Minhua-F/MarMirDrug_code.

LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa688 [doi]
AB  - SUMMARY: Dysfunctional regulations of gene expression programs relevant to 
      fundamental cell processes can drive carcinogenesis. Therefore, systematically 
      identifying dysregulation events is an effective path for understanding 
      carcinogenesis and provides insightful clues to build predictive signatures with 
      mechanistic interpretability for cancer precision medicine. Here, we implemented 
      a machine learning-based gene dysregulation analysis framework in an R package, 
      DysRegSig, which is capable of exploring gene dysregulations from 
      high-dimensional data and building mechanistic signature based on gene 
      dysregulations. DysRegSig can serve as an easy-to-use tool to facilitate gene 
      dysregulation analysis and follow-up analysis. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: 
      The source code and user's guide of DysRegSig are freely available at Github: 
      https://github.com/SCBIT-YYLab/DysRegSig. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
      Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

TI  - Prediction of Recurrence using a Stacked Denoising Autoencoder and Multifaceted 
      Feature Analysis of Pretreatment MRI in Patients with Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.
PG  - 224-243
LID - 10.2174/0118744710384129250327060846 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC) exhibits high incidence in southern 
      China. Despite improved survival with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), 
      10%-20% of patients experience local recurrence. Traditional TNM staging fails to 
      reflect tumor heterogeneity, necessitating robust recurrence prediction models. 
      This study aimed to develop an MRIbased NPC recurrence prediction model by 
      integrating radiomics, deep learning, and clinical features. METHODS: A total of 
      184 pathologically confirmed NPC patients receiving radical radiotherapy were 
      included. After propensity score matching (1:1), 136 cases were analyzed. Stacked 
      denoising autoencoder (SDAE) extracted deep features from contrast-enhanced 
      T1-weighted MRI. Radiomic features (morphology, texture, first-order statistics), 
      clinical parameters (gender, age, TNM stage), and SDAE features were combined to 
      construct 12 models using SVM, MLP, logistic regression (LR), and random forest 
      (RF). Performance was evaluated via AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, 
      with external validation (91 cases). RESULTS: Model 1 (radiomics + SDAE + 
      clinical features + SVM) achieved the highest AUC (0.89, 95% CI: 0.84-0.93), 
      accuracy (81.5%), sensitivity (67.3%), and specificity (97.9%). External 
      validation showed AUC 0.83, sensitivity 88.9%, and specificity 78%. The DeLong 
      test confirmed no significant AUC difference between internal and external 
      cohorts (P >0.05). DISCUSSION: The fusion of SDAE-enhanced features outperformed 
      traditional radiomics. SVM demonstrated optimal performance in small samples, 
      likely due to its high-dimensional feature handling and anti-overfitting 
      capability. Limitations include single-center retrospective design and lack of 
      functional imaging (DWI/PET) or molecular markers (EBV-DNA). Future multicenter 
      prospective studies and multimodal data integration are warranted to enhance 
      biological interpretability and clinical utility. CONCLUSION: This model provides 
      a tool for early recurrence risk stratification and personalized therapy 
      optimization, advancing precision medicine in NPC management.

AB  - Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized genetic diagnostics, yet its 
      application in precision medicine remains incomplete, despite significant 
      advances in computational tools for variant annotation. Many variants remain 
      unannotated, and existing tools often fail to accurately predict the range of 
      impacts that variants have on protein function. This limitation restricts their 
      utility in relevant applications such as predicting disease severity and onset 
      age. In response to these challenges, a new generation of computational models is 
      emerging, aimed at producing quantitative predictions of genetic variant impacts. 
      However, the field is still in its early stages, and several issues need to be 
      addressed, including improved performance and better interpretability. This study 
      introduces QAFI, a novel methodology that integrates protein-specific regression 
      models within an ensemble learning framework, utilizing conservation-based and 
      structure-related features derived from AlphaFold models. Our findings indicate 
      that QAFI significantly enhances the accuracy of quantitative predictions across 
      various proteins. The approach has been rigorously validated through its 
      application in the CAGI6 contest, focusing on ARSA protein variants, and further 
      tested on a comprehensive set of clinically labeled variants, demonstrating its 
      generalizability and robust predictive power. The straightforward nature of our 
      models may also contribute to better interpretability of the results.

TI  - Evaluating individual sensitivity to propofol through EEG complexity and 
      information integration: from neural dynamics to precision anesthesia.
LID - 10.1088/1741-2552/add0e6 [doi]
AB  - Objective.Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying consciousness during 
      anesthesia is critical for advancing anesthesiology and neuroscience. However, 
      given the high variability in individual sensitivity to anesthetic agents, 
      accurately elucidating the relationship between individual characteristics and 
      drug responses is also crucial for ensuring clinical anesthesia 
      safety.Approach.This study utilized high-density EEG data from 20 participants 
      under various propofol-induced sedation states. We stratified participants into 
      low- and high-sensitivity cohorts based on their behavioral responsiveness to 
      standardized auditory stimuli during sedation. Then the metrics such as 
      permutation entropy (PE), phase-lag entropy (PLE), and permutation cross mutual 
      information (PCMI) were analyzed to evaluate neural complexity, the diversity of 
      connectivity, and information integration. Machine learning models, including 
      support vector machines (SVM), were applied to classify individual sensitivity to 
      propofol, with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis providing feature 
      interpretability.Main results.Subjects were divided into high-performance 
      (low-sensitivity) group and low-performance (high-sensitivity) group based on the 
      accuracy of their responses to auditory stimuli. In the moderate sedation, the 
      high-performance group exhibited elevated PE, increased PLE in alpha band and the 
      decreased PLE in beta band, and decreased PCMI in alpha band. In the 
      resting-state, we extracted 18 metrics that were significantly different between 
      the two groups. Using these resting-state metrics as features, the SVM model 
      achieved an accuracy of 87.5% ± 0.06% in classifying individuals into high- or 
      low-sensitivity groups. SHAP analysis results indicated that the features, 
      including the PLE value of temporal in alpha band (α-PLET) and the PCMI value of 
      frontal-parietal in beta band (β-PCMIFP), were identified as robust predictors of 
      propofol sensitivity, with high weights across various models.Significance.This 
      study highlights the differential neural dynamics induced by propofol across 
      performance groups. This study highlights that resting-state metrics can predict 
      individual sensitivity to propofol. Our findings provide preliminary insights 
      into the potential utility of pre-anesthesia brain state assessments in 
      predicting individual propofol sensitivity, which may contribute to the 
      development of more precise personalized anesthesia plans.

AB  - Leveraging the potential of machine learning and recognizing the broad 
      applications of binary classification, it becomes essential to develop platforms 
      that are not only powerful but also transparent, interpretable, and user 
      friendly. We introduce alphaML, a user-friendly platform that provides clear, 
      legible, explainable, transparent, and elucidative (CLETE) binary classification 
      models with comprehensive customization options. AlphaML offers feature 
      selection, hyperparameter search, sampling, and normalization methods, along with 
      15 machine learning algorithms with global and local interpretation. We have 
      integrated a custom metric for hyperparameter search that considers both training 
      and validation scores, safeguarding against under- or overfitting. Additionally, 
      we employ the NegLog2RMSL scoring method, which uses both training and test 
      scores for a thorough model evaluation. The platform has been tested using 
      datasets from multiple domains and offers a graphical interface, removing the 
      need for programming expertise. Consequently, alphaML exhibits versatility, 
      demonstrating promising applicability across a broad spectrum of tabular data 
      configurations.

AB  - The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and multiomics has transformed 
      clinical and life sciences, enabling precision medicine and redefining disease 
      understanding. Scientific publications grew significantly from 2.1 million in 
      2012 to 3.3 million in 2022, with AI research tripling during this period. 
      Multiomics fields, including genomics and proteomics, also advanced, exemplified 
      by the Human Proteome Project achieving a 90% complete blueprint by 2021. This 
      growth highlights opportunities and challenges in integrating AI and multiomics 
      into clinical reporting. A review of studies and case reports was conducted to 
      evaluate AI and multiomics integration. Key areas analyzed included diagnostic 
      accuracy, predictive modeling, and personalized treatment approaches driven by AI 
      tools. Case examples were studied to assess impacts on clinical decision-making. 
      AI and multiomics enhanced data integration, predictive insights, and treatment 
      personalization. Fields like radiomics, genomics, and proteomics improved 
      diagnostics and guided therapy. For instance, the "AI radiomics, genomics, 
      oncopathomics, and surgomics project" combined radiomics and genomics for 
      surgical decision-making, enabling preoperative, intraoperative, and 
      postoperative interventions. AI applications in case reports predicted conditions 
      like postoperative delirium and monitored cancer progression using genomic and 
      imaging data. AI and multiomics enable standardized data analysis, dynamic 
      updates, and predictive modeling in case reports. Traditional reports often lack 
      objectivity, but AI enhances reproducibility and decision-making by processing 
      large datasets. Challenges include data standardization, biases, and ethical 
      concerns. Overcoming these barriers is vital for optimizing AI applications and 
      advancing personalized medicine. AI and multiomics integration is revolutionizing 
      clinical research and practice. Standardizing data reporting and addressing 
      challenges in ethics and data quality will unlock their full potential. 
      Emphasizing collaboration and transparency is essential for leveraging these 
      tools to improve patient care and scientific communication.

LID - 10.7759/cureus.60532 [doi]
LID - e60532
AB  - Topological deep learning (TDL) introduces a novel approach to enhancing 
      diagnostic and monitoring processes for metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty 
      liver disease (MAFLD), a condition that is increasingly prevalent globally and a 
      leading cause of liver transplantation. This editorial explores the integration 
      of topology, a branch of mathematics focused on spatial properties preserved 
      under continuous transformations, with deep learning models to improve the 
      accuracy and efficacy of MAFLD diagnosis and staging from medical imaging. TDL's 
      ability to recognize complex patterns in imaging data that traditional methods 
      might miss can lead to earlier and more precise detection, personalized 
      treatment, and potentially better patient outcomes. Challenges remain, 
      particularly regarding the computational demands and the interpretability of TDL 
      outputs, which necessitate further research and development for clinical 
      application. The potential of TDL to transform the gastroenterological landscape 
      marks a significant step toward the incorporation of advanced mathematical 
      methodologies in medical practice.

AB  - Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common malignant tumors with high 
      mortality. Accurate diagnosis and treatment decisions for GC rely heavily on 
      human experts' careful judgments on medical images. However, the improvement of 
      the accuracy is hindered by imaging conditions, limited experience, objective 
      criteria, and inter-observer discrepancies. Recently, the developments of machine 
      learning, especially deep-learning algorithms, have been facilitating computers 
      to extract more information from data automatically. Researchers are exploring 
      the far-reaching applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in various clinical 
      practices, including GC. Herein, we aim to provide a broad framework to summarize 
      current research on AI in GC. In the screening of GC, AI can identify 
      precancerous diseases and assist in early cancer detection with endoscopic 
      examination and pathological confirmation. In the diagnosis of GC, AI can support 
      tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging and subtype classification. For treatment 
      decisions, AI can help with surgical margin determination and prognosis 
      prediction. Meanwhile, current approaches are challenged by data scarcity and 
      poor interpretability. To tackle these problems, more regulated data, unified 
      processing procedures, and advanced algorithms are urgently needed to build more 
      accurate and robust AI models for GC.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) diagnosis and treatment are challenging since 
      symptoms appear late in the disease's progression. Despite clinical risk scores, 
      cardiac event prediction is inadequate, and many at-risk patients are not 
      adequately categorised by conventional risk factors alone. Integrating 
      genomic-based biomarkers (GBBM), specifically those found in plasma and/or serum 
      samples, along with novel non-invasive radiomic-based biomarkers (RBBM) such as 
      plaque area and plaque burden can improve the overall specificity of CVD risk. 
      This review proposes two hypotheses: (i) RBBM and GBBM biomarkers have a strong 
      correlation and can be used to detect the severity of CVD and stroke precisely, 
      and (ii) introduces a proposed artificial intelligence (AI)-based preventive, 
      precision, and personalized ( aiP3 ) CVD/Stroke risk model. The PRISMA search 
      selected 246 studies for the CVD/Stroke risk. It showed that using the RBBM and 
      GBBM biomarkers, deep learning (DL) modelscould be used for CVD/Stroke risk 
      stratification in the aiP3 framework. Furthermore, we present a concise overview 
      of platelet function, complete blood count (CBC), and diagnostic methods. As part 
      of the AI paradigm, we discuss explainability, pruning, bias, and benchmarking 
      against previous studies and their potential impacts. The review proposes the 
      integration of RBBM and GBBM, an innovative solution streamlined in the DL 
      paradigm for predicting CVD/Stroke risk in the aiP3 framework. The combination of 
      RBBM and GBBM introduces a powerful CVD/Stroke risk assessment paradigm. aiP3 
      model signifies a promising advancement in CVD/Stroke risk assessment.

AB  - Precision medicine marks a transformative shift towards a patient-centric 
      treatment approach, aiming to match 'the right patients with the right drugs at 
      the right time'. The exponential growth of data from diverse omics modalities, 
      electronic health records, and medical imaging has created unprecedented 
      opportunities for precision medicine. This explosion of data requires advanced 
      processing and analytical tools. At the forefront of this revolution is 
      artificial intelligence (AI), which excels at uncovering hidden patterns within 
      these high-dimensional and complex datasets. AI facilitates the integration and 
      analysis of diverse data types, unlocking unparalleled potential to characterise 
      complex diseases, improve prognosis, and predict treatment response. Despite the 
      enormous potential of AI, challenges related to interpretability, reliability, 
      generalisability, and ethical considerations emerge when translating these tools 
      from research settings into clinical practice.

TI  - Developing and validating an explainable clinlabomics-based machine-learning 
      model for screening primary angle-closure glaucoma in the context of PPPM.
PG  - 603-620
LID - 10.1007/s13167-025-00419-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) is a common cause of blindness. 
      Early screening is critical to prevent vision loss, yet current methods rely on 
      specialized ophthalmic imaging, which are resource-intensive and reactive, 
      detecting structural damage only after symptom onset. Therefore, we propose a 
      novel clinlabomics-based machine learning prediction model as a screening tool to 
      stratify individuals at high risk for glaucoma, enabling targeted ophthalmic 
      evaluations, preventing progression of optic nerve damage, and facilitating 
      personalized, long-term monitoring in alignment with the principles of 
      predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine (PPPM/3PM). METHODS: This is a 
      multicenter, retrospective study. We retrieved clinical laboratory data from 
      digital medical records between April 2016 and April 2021 in the Eye and ENT 
      Hospital of Fudan University as a discovery set, consisting of 949 normal 
      subjects and 1152 PACG patients. The internal validation was conducted on the 
      dataset of 646 normal subjects and 657 PACG patients from June 2021 to October 
      2024, also from the Eye and ENT Hospital of Fudan University; the external 
      validation was performed on a dataset of 246 normal subjects and 136 PACG 
      patients from March 2023 to June 2024, from Shanghai Xuhui Central Hospital and 
      Wanbei Coal Electric Group General Hospital. Based on whether there was optic 
      nerve damage, patients were categorized into early PACG patients, namely primary 
      angle closure(PAC) patients, and non-early PACG. Specifically, in the internal 
      validation cohort of 657 PACG patients, 160 were PAC. In the external validation 
      cohort of 136 PACG patients, 41 were PAC. With the inclusion of 50 features, 12 
      machine learning models were selected and compared to develop the screening 
      model. The feature reduction was performed by SHAP model and Delong test, and the 
      final model was explained by SHAP method. The evaluation parameters of the models 
      include AUC, AUCPR, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. RESULTS: A total of 
      1841 normal subjects and 1945 PACG patients were included in the study. Among the 
      12 machine learning models, 4 models, LGBM (AUC = 0.92), XGB (AUC = 0.92), Ada 
      (AUC = 0.91), and GB (AUC = 0.91), performed better than others (P > 0.05). After 
      feature reduction based on feature importance ranking, a final LGBM model of 
      accurate screening PACG ability with six features including TT, PDW, MCV, APTT, 
      TC, and PT was developed, achieving AUC of 0.91, AUCPR of 0.94, sensitivity of 
      0.89, specificity of 0.79, PPV of 0.84, NPV of 0.85, accuracy of 0.84, and F1 
      score of 0.86. This final model maintained strong performance in internal 
      validation (AUC = 0.87, accuracy = 0.83, F1 score = 0.85) and external validation 
      (AUC = 0.85, accuracy = 0.89, F1 score = 0.84). The screening efficacy of the 
      final model for PAC was also assessed, where the ROC was 0.85 in the internal 
      validation and 0.84 in the external validation. To enhance its practical 
      application and dissemination, the final model was transformed into an accessible 
      web application. CONCLUSION: This study establishes a clinically applicable 
      clinlabomics-based model that implements PPPM principles for glaucoma management 
      through routine blood parameters. Our predictive model enables early 
      identification of high-risk PACG patients, while also facilitating cost-effective 
      population screening and personalized risk assessment through explainable 
      artificial intelligence. The current study demonstrates that routine blood 
      parameters serve as critical indicators for glaucoma risk stratification, 
      predictive diagnosis, and targeted intervention. Consequently, this innovative 
      screening approach provides an essential tool for optimizing clinical outcomes in 
      high-risk populations and improving glaucoma care accessibility, particularly in 
      underserved communities with limited ophthalmic resources. SUPPLEMENTARY

LID - 10.1093/jamiaopen/ooz054 [doi]
AB  - Effective implementation of artificial intelligence in behavioral healthcare 
      delivery depends on overcoming challenges that are pronounced in this domain. 
      Self and social stigma contribute to under-reported symptoms, and under-coding 
      worsens ascertainment. Health disparities contribute to algorithmic bias. Lack of 
      reliable biological and clinical markers hinders model development, and model 
      explainability challenges impede trust among users. In this perspective, we 
      describe these challenges and discuss design and implementation recommendations 
      to overcome them in intelligent systems for behavioral and mental health.

TI  - Prediction of COVID-19 in-hospital mortality in older patients using artificial 
      intelligence: a multicenter study.
PG  - 1473632

AB  - BACKGROUND: Once the pandemic ended, SARS-CoV-2 became endemic, with flare-up 
      phases. COVID-19 disease can still have a significant clinical impact, especially 
      in older patients with multimorbidity and frailty. OBJECTIVE: This study aims at 
      evaluating the main characteristics associated to in-hospital mortality among 
      data routinely collected upon admission to identify older patients at higher risk 
      of death. METHODS: The present study used data from Gerocovid-acute wards, an 
      observational multicenter retrospective-prospective study conducted in geriatric 
      and internal medicine wards in subjects ≥60 years old during the COVID-19 
      pandemic. Seventy-one routinely collected variables, including demographic data, 
      living arrangements, smoking habits, pre-COVID-19 mobility, chronic diseases, and 
      clinical and laboratory parameters were integrated into a web-based machine 
      learning platform (Just Add Data Bio) to identify factors with the highest 
      prognostic relevance. The use of artificial intelligence allowed us to avoid 
      variable selection bias, to test a large number of models and to perform an 
      internal validation. RESULTS: The dataset was split into training and test sets, 
      based on a 70:30 ratio and matching on age, sex, and proportion of events; 3,520 
      models were set out to train. The three predictive algorithms (optimized for 
      performance, interpretability, or aggressive feature selection) converged on the 
      same model, including 12 variables: pre-COVID-19 mobility, World Health 
      Organization disease severity, age, heart rate, arterial blood gases bicarbonate 
      and oxygen saturation, serum potassium, systolic blood pressure, blood glucose, 
      aspartate aminotransferase, PaO2/FiO2 ratio and derived neutrophil-to-lymphocyte 
      ratio. CONCLUSION: Beyond variables reflecting the severity of COVID-19 disease 
      failure, pre-morbid mobility level was the strongest factor associated with 
      in-hospital mortality reflecting the importance of functional status as a 
      synthetic measure of health in older adults, while the association between 
      derived neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and mortality, confirms the fundamental 
      role played by neutrophils in SARS-CoV-2 disease.

PG  - e63635

LID - e63635
AB  - Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) such as pneumonia, bronchitis, and COVID-19 
      are significant global health concerns due to their high morbidity and mortality 
      rates. The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) offers innovative solutions 
      across various aspects of RTI management, including diagnosis, prediction, 
      treatment, and prevention. AI algorithms enhance diagnostic accuracy by analyzing 
      extensive data from electronic health records and imaging studies, often 
      surpassing human radiologists in identifying diseases such as pneumonia. For 
      instance, AI-based image recognition tools have demonstrated remarkable precision 
      in detecting pneumonia from chest X-rays. Additionally, AI models can predict 
      disease outbreaks and optimize public health responses, as exemplified during the 
      COVID-19 pandemic where AI predicted infection hotspots and evaluated the 
      effectiveness of containment measures. In personalized medicine, AI tailors 
      treatments based on individual patient profiles, thereby improving therapeutic 
      outcomes and accelerating drug discovery. Wearable AI devices facilitate early 
      detection and prevention of RTIs through continuous health monitoring. Despite 
      its transformative potential, AI implementation in healthcare faces challenges, 
      including data privacy, algorithm transparency, and ethical concerns. Addressing 
      these issues necessitates collaboration among technologists, healthcare 
      providers, and policymakers to ensure responsible and equitable integration of AI 
      technologies. This editorial underscores the transformative potential of AI in 
      managing RTIs and calls for robust frameworks to harness AI's benefits while 
      safeguarding patient rights.

AB  - Many gene signatures have been developed by applying machine learning (ML) on 
      omics profiles, however, their clinical utility is often hindered by limited 
      interpretability and unstable performance. Here, we show the importance of 
      embedding prior biological knowledge in the decision rules yielded by ML 
      approaches to build robust classifiers. We tested this by applying different ML 
      algorithms on gene expression data to predict three difficult cancer phenotypes: 
      bladder cancer progression to muscle-invasive disease, response to neoadjuvant 
      chemotherapy in triple-negative breast cancer, and prostate cancer metastatic 
      progression. We developed two sets of classifiers: mechanistic, by restricting 
      the training to features capturing specific biological mechanisms; and agnostic, 
      in which the training did not use any a priori biological information. 
      Mechanistic models had a similar or better testing performance than their 
      agnostic counterparts, with enhanced interpretability. Our findings support the 
      use of biological constraints to develop robust gene signatures with high 
      translational potential.

AB  - Exa-scale volumes of medical data have been produced for decades. In most cases, 
      the diagnosis is reported in free text, encoding medical knowledge that is still 
      largely unexploited. In order to allow decoding medical knowledge included in 
      reports, we propose an unsupervised knowledge extraction system combining a 
      rule-based expert system with pre-trained Machine Learning (ML) models, namely 
      the Semantic Knowledge Extractor Tool (SKET). Combining rule-based techniques and 
      pre-trained ML models provides high accuracy results for knowledge extraction. 
      This work demonstrates the viability of unsupervised Natural Language Processing 
      (NLP) techniques to extract critical information from cancer reports, opening 
      opportunities such as data mining for knowledge extraction purposes, precision 
      medicine applications, structured report creation, and multimodal learning. SKET 
      is a practical and unsupervised approach to extracting knowledge from pathology 
      reports, which opens up unprecedented opportunities to exploit textual and 
      multimodal medical information in clinical practice. We also propose SKET 
      eXplained (SKET X), a web-based system providing visual explanations about the 
      algorithmic decisions taken by SKET. SKET X is designed/developed to support 
      pathologists and domain experts in understanding SKET predictions, possibly 
      driving further improvements to the system.

AB  - Identifying features that interact to trigger disease, while accounting for 
      heterogeneity across diverse populations, is essential for the development of 
      precision and targeted medicine. Despite the availability of vast and complex 
      health-related datasets, most existing works focus on identifying 
      disease-associated features at the population level or within a few 
      subpopulations, often overlooking individual-level heterogeneity within these 
      groups. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that utilizes 
      localized test statistics to identify disease-associated features tailored to 
      individual profiles. Our method leverages the recently developed knockoffs 
      methodology to control the noise level of the selection set so that the results 
      are replicable. Moreover, it allows for the discovery of hidden heterogeneous 
      effects within the data, as demonstrated in an application to single-cell RNA 
      sequencing data for Alzheimer's disease. By aggregating localized feature 
      selection results, our framework also enables powerful population-level feature 
      selection. Our framework provides a powerful tool for exploratory studies of 
      precision medicine, offering the potential to generate novel hypotheses for 
      confirmatory biological experiments.

AB  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is considered the best imaging modality for 
      non-invasive observation of prostate cancer. However, the existing quantitative 
      analysis methods still have challenges in patient-level prediction, including 
      accuracy, interpretability, context understanding, tumor delineation dependence, 
      and multiple sequence fusion. Therefore, we propose a topological graph-guided 
      multi-instance network (GMINet) to catch global contextual information of 
      multi-parametric MRI for patient-level prediction. We integrate visual 
      information from multi-slice MRI with slice-to-slice correlations for a more 
      complete context. A novel strategy of attention folwing is proposed to fuse 
      different MRI-based network branches for mp-MRI. Our method achieves 
      state-of-the-art performance for Prostate cancer on a multi-center dataset 
      (N = 478) and a public dataset (N = 204). The five-classification accuracy of 
      Grade Group is 81.1 ± 1.8% (multi-center dataset) from the test set of five-fold 
      cross-validation, and the area under curve of detecting clinically significant 
      prostate cancer is 0.801 ± 0.018 (public dataset) from the test set of five-fold 
      cross-validation respectively. The model also achieves tumor detection based on 
      attention analysis, which improves the interpretability of the model. The novel 
      method is hopeful to further improve the accurate prediction ability of MRI in 
      the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer.

TI  - Investigation of Growth Differentiation Factor 15 as a Prognostic Biomarker for 
      Major Adverse Limb Events in Peripheral Artery Disease.
LID - 10.3390/jcm14155239 [doi]
LID - 5239
AB  - Background/Objectives: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) impacts more than 200 
      million individuals globally and leads to mortality and morbidity secondary to 
      progressive limb dysfunction and amputation. However, clinical management of PAD 
      remains suboptimal, in part because of the lack of standardized biomarkers to 
      predict patient outcomes. Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) is a 
      stress-responsive cytokine that has been studied extensively in cardiovascular 
      disease, but its investigation in PAD remains limited. This study aimed to use 
      explainable statistical and machine learning methods to assess the prognostic 
      value of GDF15 for limb outcomes in patients with PAD. Methods: This prognostic 
      investigation was carried out using a prospectively enrolled cohort comprising 
      454 patients diagnosed with PAD. At baseline, plasma GDF15 levels were measured 
      using a validated multiplex immunoassay. Participants were monitored over a 
      two-year period to assess the occurrence of major adverse limb events (MALE), a 
      composite outcome encompassing major lower extremity amputation, need for 
      open/endovascular revascularization, or acute limb ischemia. An Extreme Gradient 
      Boosting (XGBoost) model was trained to predict 2-year MALE using 10-fold 
      cross-validation, incorporating GDF15 levels along with baseline variables. Model 
      performance was primarily evaluated using the area under the receiver operating 
      characteristic curve (AUROC). Secondary model evaluation metrics were accuracy, 
      sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), and positive 
      predictive value (PPV). Prediction histogram plots were generated to assess the 
      ability of the model to discriminate between patients who develop vs. do not 
      develop 2-year MALE. For model interpretability, SHapley Additive exPlanations 
      (SHAP) analysis was performed to evaluate the relative contribution of each 
      predictor to model outputs. Results: The mean age of the cohort was 71 (SD 10) 
      years, with 31% (n = 139) being female. Over the two-year follow-up period, 157 
      patients (34.6%) experienced MALE. The XGBoost model incorporating plasma GDF15 
      levels and demographic/clinical features achieved excellent performance for 
      predicting 2-year MALE in PAD patients: AUROC 0.84, accuracy 83.5%, sensitivity 
      83.6%, specificity 83.7%, PPV 87.3%, and NPV 86.2%. The prediction probability 
      histogram for the XGBoost model demonstrated clear separation for patients who 
      developed vs. did not develop 2-year MALE, indicating strong discrimination 
      ability. SHAP analysis showed that GDF15 was the strongest predictive feature for 
      2-year MALE, followed by age, smoking status, and other cardiovascular 
      comorbidities, highlighting its clinical relevance. Conclusions: Using 
      explainable statistical and machine learning methods, we demonstrated that plasma 
      GDF15 levels have important prognostic value for 2-year MALE in patients with 
      PAD. By integrating clinical variables with GDF15 levels, our machine learning 
      model can support early identification of PAD patients at elevated risk for 
      adverse limb events, facilitating timely referral to vascular specialists and 
      aiding in decisions regarding the aggressiveness of medical/surgical treatment. 
      This precision medicine approach based on a biomarker-guided prognostication 
      algorithm offers a promising strategy for improving limb outcomes in individuals 
      with PAD.

AB  - Our opinion piece pays homage to the evolution of medical practices, tracing back 
      to the era of Hippocrates, through significant historical milestones, and drawing 
      parallels with the principles underpinning foundational artificial intelligence 
      (AI) models. It emphasizes the shared ethos of both domains: a commitment to 
      comprehensive care that values diverse data integration and individualized 
      patient treatment. The excitement surrounding foundation models in medical 
      imaging is understandable. However, a critical and cautious approach is crucial 
      before widespread adoption. By addressing the present 4 major limitations (ie, 
      data bias and generalizability, interpretability of AI models, data scarcity and 
      diversity, and computational resources and infrastructure) and fostering a 
      culture of rigorous research, we can unlock the true potential of these models 
      and revolutionize medical care. This critique (opinion) paper highlights the need 
      for a more measured approach in the field of foundation AI models for medicine in 
      general and for medical imaging in particular. It emphasizes the importance of 
      tackling core challenges before rushing toward clinical applications. By focusing 
      on robust methodologies and addressing limitations, researchers can ensure the 
      development of truly impactful and trustworthy models for the betterment of 
      healthcare.

TI  - Enhancing Herbal Medicine-Drug Interaction Prediction Using Large Language 
      Models.
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2025.3558667 [doi]
AB  - Investigating potential interactions between drugs and herbal medicines helps 
      optimize combined treatment strategies and supports personalized and precision 
      medicine. Deep learning-based methods have been successful in predicting 
      drug-related interactions. However, these methods face challenges such as low 
      data quality and uneven distribution. Large language models (LLMs) effectively 
      address these challenges through their extensive knowledge bases. Motivated by 
      this, we integrate LLMs, one-hot encoding, and variational graph autoencoders 
      (VGAEs) to propose a herbal medicine-drug interaction (HDI) prediction model. 
      First, LLMs are employed to extract features from drug SMILES, generating 
      high-quality molecular representations. Second, one-hot encoding is applied to 
      herbal medicines with multiple natural products to construct feature vectors and 
      improve model interpretability. Finally, VGAEs are utilized to reconstruct herbal 
      medicine-drug graphs and predict unknown HDIs. Additionally, we differentiate 
      between herbal medicine-drug similarity and the degree of individual drug or 
      herbal medicine nodes to mitigate the dominance of high-degree nodes in VGAE 
      message flow. Multiple experiments were conducted to validate the significance of 
      the proposed model and its key components. This method shows great potential for 
      applications in traditional Chinese medicine formulation optimization, new drug 
      development, and precision medicine. Our code and data are accessible at:

TI  - A Meta-Analysis of the Diagnosis of Condylar and Mandibular Fractures Based on 
      3-dimensional Imaging and Artificial Intelligence.
LID - 10.1097/SCS.0000000000011622 [doi]
AB  - This article aims to review the literature, study the current situation of using 
      3D images and artificial intelligence-assisted methods to improve the rapid and 
      accurate classification and diagnosis of condylar fractures and conduct a 
      meta-analysis of mandibular fractures. Mandibular condyle fracture is a common 
      fracture type in maxillofacial surgery. Accurate classification and diagnosis of 
      condylar fractures are critical to developing an effective treatment plan. With 
      the rapid development of 3-dimensional imaging technology and artificial 
      intelligence (AI), traditional x-ray diagnosis is gradually replaced by more 
      accurate technologies such as 3-dimensional computed tomography (CT). These 
      emerging technologies provide more detailed anatomic information and 
      significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of condylar fracture diagnosis, 
      especially in the evaluation and surgical planning of complex fractures. The 
      application of artificial intelligence in medical imaging is further analyzed, 
      especially the successful cases of fracture detection and classification through 
      deep learning models. Although AI technology has demonstrated great potential in 
      condylar fracture diagnosis, it still faces challenges such as data quality, 
      model interpretability, and clinical validation. This article evaluates the 
      accuracy and practicality of AI in diagnosing mandibular fractures through a 
      systematic review and meta-analysis of the existing literature. The results show 
      that AI-assisted diagnosis has high prediction accuracy in detecting condylar 
      fractures and significantly improves diagnostic efficiency. However, more 
      multicenter studies are still needed to verify the application of AI in different 
      clinical settings to promote its widespread application in maxillofacial surgery.

TI  - Opportunities and Challenges of Cardiovascular Disease Risk Prediction for 
      Primary Prevention Using Machine Learning and Electronic Health Records: A 
      Systematic Review.
PG  - 37443
LID - 10.31083/RCM37443 [doi]
LID - 37443
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the foremost cause of morbidity 
      and mortality worldwide. Recent advancements in machine learning (ML) have 
      demonstrated substantial potential in augmenting risk stratification for primary 
      prevention, surpassing conventional statistical models in predictive performance. 
      Thus, integrating ML with Electronic Health Records (EHRs) enables refined risk 
      estimation by leveraging the granularity and breadth of longitudinal individual 
      patient data. However, fundamental barriers persist, including limited 
      generalizability, challenges in interpretability, and the absence of rigorous 
      external validation, all of which impede widespread clinical deployment. METHODS: 
      This review adheres to the methodological rigor of the Preferred Reporting Items 
      for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Scale for the Assessment of 
      Narrative Review Articles (SANRA) guidelines. A systematic literature search was 
      performed in March 2024, encompassing the Medline and Embase databases, to 
      identify studies published since 2010. Supplementary references were retrieved 
      from the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science, and manual 
      searches were curated. The selection process, conducted via Rayyan, focused on 
      systematic and narrative reviews evaluating ML-driven models for long-term CVD 
      risk prediction within primary prevention contexts utilizing EHR data. Studies 
      investigating short-term prognostication, highly specific comorbid cohorts, or 
      conventional models devoid of ML components were excluded. RESULTS: Following an 
      exhaustive screening of 1757 records, 22 studies met the inclusion criteria. Of 
      these, 10 were systematic reviews (four incorporating meta-analyses), while 12 
      constituted narrative reviews, with the majority published post-2020. The 
      synthesis underscores the superiority of ML in modeling intricate EHR-derived 
      risk factors, facilitating precision-driven cardiovascular risk assessment. 
      Nonetheless, salient challenges endure heterogeneity in CVD outcome definitions, 
      undermine comparability, data incompleteness and inconsistency compromise model 
      robustness, and a dearth of external validation constrains clinical 
      translatability. Moreover, ethical and regulatory considerations, including 
      algorithmic opacity, equity in predictive performance, and the absence of 
      standardized evaluation frameworks, pose formidable obstacles to seamless 
      integration into clinical workflows. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the transformative 
      potential of ML-based CVD risk prediction, it remains encumbered by 
      methodological, technical, and regulatory impediments that hinder its full-scale 
      adoption into real-world healthcare settings. This review underscores the 
      imperative circumstances for standardized validation protocols, stringent 
      regulatory oversight, and interdisciplinary collaboration to bridge the 
      translational divide. Our findings established an integrative framework for 
      developing, validating, and applying ML-based CVD risk prediction algorithms, 
      addressing both clinical and technical dimensions. To further advance this field, 
      we propose a standardized, transparent, and regulated EHR platform that 
      facilitates fair model evaluation, reproducibility, and clinical translation by 
      providing a high-quality, representative dataset with structured governance and 
      benchmarking mechanisms. Meanwhile, future endeavors must prioritize enhancing 
      model transparency, mitigating biases, and ensuring adaptability to heterogeneous 
      clinical populations, fostering equitable and evidence-based implementation of 
      ML-driven predictive analytics in cardiovascular medicine.

PG  - 2303-2314
LID - 10.2147/CCID.S542866 [doi]
AB  - Scars-including keloids, hypertrophic scars, and acne scars-pose substantial 
      functional and psychosocial burdens that current empirical treatments often 
      address by trial-and-error. Quantitative evidence now supports a precision 
      framework. Validated clinical tools (eg, VSS, POSAS) and imaging modalities (3D 
      photogrammetry; high-frequency ultrasound elastography) provide objective 
      baselines, while emerging AI models deliver measurable gains: an automated 
      scar-type classifier achieved precision 80.7%, recall 71.0%, AUC 0.846 for 
      image-based categorization, and a clinical recurrence model for keloids reported 
      AUC 0.889 with sensitivity 78.7% and specificity 86.8%, enabling earlier 
      risk-stratified interventions and fewer ineffective treatment cycles in 
      model-informed pathways. We synthesize cytokine/fibroblast signatures and genetic 
      predisposition with multimodal (clinical-imaging-molecular) learning, detail 
      validation challenges, and propose actionable safeguards (TRIPOD+AI-aligned 
      reporting, internal-external validation, bias audits, SHAP-based 
      interpretability, and federated learning to preserve privacy and improve 
      generalizability). A pragmatic roadmap-including funding mechanisms, stakeholder 
      roles, and a barrier-solution matrix-aims to accelerate translation toward 
      predictive, preventive, and personalized scar care.

TI  - Interpretable Clinical Decision Support System for Audiology Based on Predicted 
      Common Audiological Functional Parameters (CAFPAs).
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics12020463 [doi]
LID - 463
AB  - Common Audiological Functional Parameters (CAFPAs) were previously introduced as 
      abstract, measurement-independent representation of audiological knowledge, and 
      expert-estimated CAFPAs were shown to be applicable as an interpretable 
      intermediate layer in a clinical decision support system (CDSS). Prediction 
      models for CAFPAs were built based on expert knowledge and one audiological 
      database to allow for data-driven estimation of CAFPAs for new, individual 
      patients for whom no expert-estimated CAFPAs are available. Based on the 
      combination of these components, the current study explores the feasibility of 
      constructing a CDSS which is as interpretable as expert knowledge-based 
      classification and as data-driven as machine learning-based classification. To 
      test this hypothesis, the current study investigated the equivalence in 
      performance of predicted CAFPAs compared to expert-estimated CAFPAs in an 
      audiological classification task, analyzed the importance of different CAFPAs for 
      high and comparable performance, and derived explanations for differences in 
      classified categories. Results show that the combination of predicted CAFPAs and 
      statistical classification enables to build an interpretable but data-driven 
      CDSS. The classification provides good accuracy, with most categories being 
      correctly classified, while some confusions can be explained by the properties of 
      the employed database. This could be improved by including additional databases 
      in the CDSS, which is possible within the presented framework.

TI  - Drug Repositioning and Subgroup Discovery for Precision Medicine Implementation 
      in Triple Negative Breast Cancer.
LID - 10.3390/cancers13246278 [doi]
LID - 6278
AB  - Breast cancer (BC) is the leading cause of death among female patients with 
      cancer. Patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) have the lowest 
      survival rate. TNBC has substantial heterogeneity within the BC population. This 
      study utilized our novel patient stratification and drug repositioning method to 
      find subgroups of BC patients that share common genetic profiles and that may 
      respond similarly to the recommended drugs. After further examination of the 
      discovered patient subgroups, we identified five homogeneous druggable TNBC 
      subgroups. A drug repositioning algorithm was then applied to find the drugs with 
      a high potential for each subgroup. Most of the top drugs for these subgroups 
      were chemotherapy used for various types of cancer, including BC. After analyzing 
      the biological mechanisms targeted by these drugs, ferroptosis was the common 
      cell death mechanism induced by the top drugs in the subgroups with neoplasm 
      subdivision and race as clinical variables. In contrast, the antioxidative effect 
      on cancer cells was the common targeted mechanism in the subgroup of patients 
      with an age less than 50. Literature reviews were used to validate our findings, 
      which could provide invaluable insights to streamline the drug repositioning 
      process and could be further studied in a wet lab setting and in clinical trials.

TI  - Dissecting the genetic complexity of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue 
      syndrome via deep learning-powered genome analysis.
LID - 2025.04.15.25325899 [pii]
LID - 10.1101/2025.04.15.25325899 [doi]
AB  - Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex, 
      heterogeneous, and systemic disease defined by a suite of symptoms, including 
      unexplained persistent fatigue, post-exertional malaise (PEM), cognitive 
      impairment, myalgia, orthostatic intolerance, and unrefreshing sleep. The disease 
      mechanism of ME/CFS is unknown, with no effective curative treatments. In this 
      study, we present a multi-site ME/CFS whole-genome analysis, which is powered by 
      a novel deep learning framework, HEAL2. We show that HEAL2 not only has 
      predictive value for ME/CFS based on personal rare variants, but also links 
      genetic risk to various ME/CFS-associated symptoms. Model interpretation of HEAL2 
      identifies 115 ME/CFS-risk genes that exhibit significant intolerance to 
      loss-of-function (LoF) mutations. Transcriptome and network analyses highlight 
      the functional importance of these genes across a wide range of tissues and cell 
      types, including the central nervous system (CNS) and immune cells. 
      Patient-derived multi-omics data implicate reduced expression of ME/CFS risk 
      genes within ME/CFS patients, including in the plasma proteome, and the 
      transcriptomes of B and T cells, especially cytotoxic CD4 T cells, supporting 
      their disease relevance. Pan-phenotype analysis of ME/CFS genes further reveals 
      the genetic correlation between ME/CFS and other complex diseases and traits, 
      including depression and long COVID-19. Overall, HEAL2 provides a candidate 
      genetic-based diagnostic tool for ME/CFS, and our findings contribute to a 
      comprehensive understanding of the genetic, molecular, and cellular basis of 
      ME/CFS, yielding novel insights into therapeutic targets. Our deep learning model 
      also offers a potent, broadly applicable framework for parallel rare variant 
      analysis and genetic prediction for other complex diseases and traits.

TI  - Artificial intelligence in dentistry: a narrative review of applications, 
      challenges, and future directions.
LID - 10.23736/S2724-6329.25.05217-9 [doi]
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly influencing dental practice, 
      offering advancements in diagnostics, treatment planning, and patient management. 
      This narrative review explores the current applications of AI in dentistry, 
      addressing clinical, technological, and ethical dimensions. A non-systematic 
      narrative approach was employed to synthesize recent literature on AI in 
      dentistry. The focus was on diagnostic tools, treatment planning, decision 
      support systems, teledentistry, ethical implications, and emerging technologies. 
      AI demonstrates high performance in image analysis (e.g., caries detection, 
      periodontal assessment, oral cancer screening), treatment optimization (e.g., 
      orthodontics, implant planning), and patient-specific risk modeling. Clinical 
      decision support systems (CDSS) assist in evidence-based care, while AI-driven 
      chatbots and remote monitoring platforms enhance patient engagement and access. 
      However, challenges persist regarding algorithm transparency, data bias, legal 
      liability, and privacy. Future directions include multimodal data integration, 
      digital twins, and AI-driven precision dentistry. AI represents a paradigm shift 
      in dentistry, supporting clinicians and enabling more accurate, accessible, and 
      personalized care. Successful implementation will depend on ethical deployment, 
      robust regulation, and adequate training to harness its full potential without 
      compromising professional standards.

AB  - Despite major advances in artificial intelligence (AI) research for healthcare, 
      the deployment and adoption of AI technologies remain limited in clinical 
      practice. This paper describes the FUTURE-AI framework, which provides guidance 
      for the development and deployment of trustworthy AI tools in healthcare. The 
      FUTURE-AI Consortium was founded in 2021 and comprises 117 interdisciplinary 
      experts from 50 countries representing all continents, including AI scientists, 
      clinical researchers, biomedical ethicists, and social scientists. Over a two 
      year period, the FUTURE-AI guideline was established through consensus based on 
      six guiding principles—fairness, universality, traceability, usability, 
      robustness, and explainability. To operationalise trustworthy AI in healthcare, a 
      set of 30 best practices were defined, addressing technical, clinical, 
      socioethical, and legal dimensions. The recommendations cover the entire 
      lifecycle of healthcare AI, from design, development, and validation to 
      regulation, deployment, and monitoring.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have the potential to revolutionize drug 
      release modeling, optimize therapy for personalized medicine, and minimize side 
      effects. By applying AI algorithms, researchers can predict drug release 
      profiles, incorporate patient-specific factors, and optimize dosage regimens to 
      achieve tailored and effective therapies. This AI-based approach has the 
      potential to improve treatment outcomes, enhance patient satisfaction, and 
      advance the field of pharmaceutical sciences. International collaborations and 
      professional organizations play vital roles in establishing guidelines and best 
      practices for data collection and sharing. Open data initiatives can enhance 
      transparency and scientific progress, facilitating algorithm validation.

TI  - The transformative impact of large language models on medical writing and 
      publishing: current applications, challenges and future directions.
PG  - 393-401
LID - 10.4196/kjpp.2024.28.5.393 [doi]
AB  - Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming medical writing and 
      publishing. This review article focuses on experimental evidence to provide a 
      comprehensive overview of the current applications, challenges, and future 
      implications of LLMs in various stages of academic research and publishing 
      process. Global surveys reveal a high prevalence of LLM usage in scientific 
      writing, with both potential benefits and challenges associated with its 
      adoption. LLMs have been successfully applied in literature search, research 
      design, writing assistance, quality assessment, citation generation, and data 
      analysis. LLMs have also been used in peer review and publication processes, 
      including manuscript screening, generating review comments, and identifying 
      potential biases. To ensure the integrity and quality of scholarly work in the 
      era of LLM-assisted research, responsible artificial intelligence (AI) use is 
      crucial. Researchers should prioritize verifying the accuracy and reliability of 
      AI-generated content, maintain transparency in the use of LLMs, and develop 
      collaborative human-AI workflows. Reviewers should focus on higher-order 
      reviewing skills and be aware of the potential use of LLMs in manuscripts. 
      Editorial offices should develop clear policies and guidelines on AI use and 
      foster open dialogue within the academic community. Future directions include 
      addressing the limitations and biases of current LLMs, exploring innovative 
      applications, and continuously updating policies and practices in response to 
      technological advancements. Collaborative efforts among stakeholders are 
      necessary to harness the transformative potential of LLMs while maintaining the 
      integrity of medical writing and publishing.

TI  - A foundation model for clinician-centered drug repurposing.

AB  - Drug repurposing - identifying new therapeutic uses for approved drugs - is often 
      serendipitous and opportunistic, expanding the use of drugs for new diseases. The 
      clinical utility of drug repurposing AI models remains limited because the models 
      focus narrowly on diseases for which some drugs already exist. Here, we introduce 
      TXGNN, a graph foundation model for zero-shot drug repurposing, identifying 
      therapeutic candidates even for diseases with limited treatment options or no 
      existing drugs. Trained on a medical knowledge graph, TXGNN utilizes a graph 
      neural network and metric-learning module to rank drugs as potential indications 
      and contraindications across 17,080 diseases. When benchmarked against eight 
      methods, TXGNN improves prediction accuracy for indications by 49.2% and 
      contraindications by 35.1% under stringent zero-shot evaluation. To facilitate 
      model interpretation, TXGNN's Explainer module offers transparent insights into 
      multi-hop medical knowledge paths that form TXGNN's predictive rationales. Human 
      evaluation of TXGNN's Explainer showed that TXGNN's predictions and explanations 
      perform encouragingly on multiple axes of performance beyond accuracy. Many of 
      TxGNN's novel predictions align with off-label prescriptions clinicians make in a 
      large healthcare system. TXGNN's drug repurposing predictions are accurate, 
      consistent with off-label drug use, and can be investigated by human experts 
      through multi-hop interpretable rationales.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma (GBM) remains associated with a dismal prognoses despite 
      standard therapies. While population-level survival statistics are established, 
      generating individualized prognosis remains challenging. We aim to develop 
      machine learning (ML) models that generate personalized survival predictions for 
      GBM patients to enhance prognostication. METHODS: Adult patients with 
      histologically confirmed IDH-wildtype GBM from the National Cancer Database 
      (NCDB) were analyzed. ML models were developed with TabPFN, TabNet, XGBoost, 
      LightGBM, and Random Forest algorithms to predict mortality at 6, 12, 18, and 24 
      months postdiagnosis. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were employed to 
      enhance the interpretability of the models. Models were primarily evaluated using 
      the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) values, and the 
      top-performing models indicated by the highest AUROCs for each outcome were 
      deployed in a web application that was created for individualized predictions. 
      RESULTS: A total of 7537 patients were retrieved from the NCDB. Performance 
      evaluation revealed the top-performing models for each outcome were built using 
      the TabPFN algorithm. The TabPFN models yielded mean AUROCs of 0.836, 0.78, 
      0.732, and 0.724 in predicting 6, 12, 18, and 24 month mortality, respectively. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study establishes ML models tailored to individual patients to 
      enhance GBM prognostication. Future work should focus on external validation and 
      dynamic updating as new data emerge.

AB  - Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, with approximately 2 
      million new cases and 1.8 million deaths annually, and studies suggest that by 
      2050, these numbers will reach 3.8 million cases and 3.2 million deaths. The high 
      mortality rate highlights the urgent need for early diagnosis and rapid drug 
      development. Genomic approaches provide insights into tumour biology, supporting 
      personalised medicine. This study explores the role of machine learning (ML) in 
      enhancing genomic analysis and drug discovery for lung cancer treatment. A 
      comprehensive PubMed search was conducted to identify relevant publications from 
      the last 10 years. Selected studies were critically reviewed to understand how ML 
      algorithms are applied in lung cancer genomics and drug discovery. ML algorithms 
      such as random forests, gradient boosting, support vector machines, autoencoders, 
      CNNs, and RNNs are widely used for genomic pattern identification. Techniques 
      like reinforcement learning, deep neural networks, GANs, and GNNs are employed 
      for drug discovery. ML models have achieved over 95% accuracy in certain lung 
      cancer applications. However, challenges remain, including data scarcity and 
      model interpretability. ML significantly enhances lung cancer's genomic analysis 
      and drug design; however, further optimisation and clinical validation are 
      essential for effective real-world implementation.

TI  - Machine learning based prediction models for cardiovascular disease risk using 
      electronic health records data: systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 7-22
LID - 10.1093/ehjdh/ztae080 [doi]
AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a major cause of mortality in the UK, 
      prompting the need for improved risk predictive models for primary prevention. 
      Machine learning (ML) models utilizing electronic health records (EHRs) offer 
      potential enhancements over traditional risk scores like QRISK3 and ASCVD. To 
      systematically evaluate and compare the efficacy of ML models against 
      conventional CVD risk prediction algorithms using EHR data for medium to 
      long-term (5-10 years) CVD risk prediction. A systematic review and random-effect 
      meta-analysis were conducted according to preferred reporting items for 
      systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines, assessing studies from 2010 to 
      2024. We retrieved 32 ML models and 26 conventional statistical models from 20 
      selected studies, focusing on performance metrics such as area under the curve 
      (AUC) and heterogeneity across models. ML models, particularly random forest and 
      deep learning, demonstrated superior performance, with the highest recorded 
      pooled AUCs of 0.865 (95% CI: 0.812-0.917) and 0.847 (95% CI: 0.766-0.927), 
      respectively. These significantly outperformed the conventional risk score of 
      0.765 (95% CI: 0.734-0.796). However, significant heterogeneity (I² > 99%) and 
      potential publication bias were noted across the studies. While ML models show 
      enhanced calibration for CVD risk, substantial variability and methodological 
      concerns limit their current clinical applicability. Future research should 
      address these issues by enhancing methodological transparency and standardization 
      to improve the reliability and utility of these models in clinical settings. This 
      study highlights the advanced capabilities of ML models in CVD risk prediction 
      and emphasizes the need for rigorous validation to facilitate their integration 
      into clinical practice.

TI  - A Novel Kernel-Based Hilbert Space Framework for Predictive Modeling of 
      lncRNA-miRNA-Disease Interaction Networks.
LID - 10.1109/TCBBIO.2025.3598013 [doi]
AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) are vital regulators of 
      gene expression. They are closely linked to the development and progression of 
      various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Their 
      interactions form complex lncRNA-miRNA-disease networks (LMDNets), which modulate 
      key disease-associated biological pathways. Although recent computational 
      approaches have attempted to integrate diverse biological data such as gene 
      expression profiles, sequence information, and disease associations. They often 
      face significant challenges, including limited interpretability, reliance on 
      manually curated datasets, poor scalability, and high sensitivity to noise and 
      missing data. To overcome these limitations, we propose KHSF-LMDNet, a 
      kernel-based Hilbert space framework for modeling lncRNA-miRNA-disease networks. 
      This model integrates graph-based biological networks, similarity features, and 
      deep learning with an attention mechanism to map complex interactions into a 
      Hilbert subspace, enabling more robust and interpretable learning. Evaluated on 
      benchmark datasets, KHSF-LMDNet consistently outperforms existing methods in 
      terms of accuracy, precision, and area under the ROC curve (AUC). Additionally, 
      it effectively ranks disease-associated lncRNAs and miRNAs, identifying top 
      candidates related to cancer and Alzheimer's disease, thereby supporting 
      functional genomics research and facilitating the discovery of novel biomarkers 
      for precision medicine.

AB  - Algorithms that accurately predict gene structure from primary sequence alone 
      were transformative for annotating the human genome. Can we also predict the 
      expression levels of genes based solely on genome sequence? Here, we sought to 
      apply deep convolutional neural networks toward that goal. Surprisingly, a model 
      that includes only promoter sequences and features associated with mRNA stability 
      explains 59% and 71% of variation in steady-state mRNA levels in human and mouse, 
      respectively. This model, termed Xpresso, more than doubles the accuracy of 
      alternative sequence-based models and isolates rules as predictive as models 
      relying on chromatic immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data. Xpresso 
      recapitulates genome-wide patterns of transcriptional activity, and its residuals 
      can be used to quantify the influence of enhancers, heterochromatic domains, and 
      microRNAs. Model interpretation reveals that promoter-proximal CpG dinucleotides 
      strongly predict transcriptional activity. Looking forward, we propose 
      cell-type-specific gene-expression predictions based solely on primary sequences 
      as a grand challenge for the field.

AB  - This review explores the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and 
      anesthesia, examining its transformative impact on patient care across various 
      phases. Beginning with a historical overview of anesthesia, we highlight the 
      critical role of technological advancements in ensuring optimal patient outcomes. 
      The emergence of AI in healthcare sets the stage for a comprehensive analysis of 
      its applications in anesthesia. In the preoperative phase, AI facilitates 
      personalized risk assessments and decision support, optimizing anesthesia 
      planning and drug dosage predictions. Moving to the intraoperative phase, we 
      delve into AI's role in monitoring and control through sophisticated anesthesia 
      monitoring and closed-loop systems. Additionally, we discuss the integration of 
      robotics and AI-guided procedures, revolutionizing surgical assistance. 
      Transitioning to the postoperative phase, we explore AI-driven postoperative 
      monitoring, predictive analysis for complications, and the integration of AI into 
      rehabilitation programs and long-term follow-up. These new applications redefine 
      patient recovery, emphasizing personalized care and proactive interventions. 
      However, the integration of AI in anesthesia poses challenges and ethical 
      considerations. Data security, interpretability, and bias in AI algorithms demand 
      scrutiny. Moreover, the evolving patient-doctor relationship in an AI-driven care 
      landscape requires a delicate balance between efficiency and human touch. Looking 
      forward, we discuss the future directions of AI in anesthesia, anticipating 
      advances in technology and AI algorithms. The integration of AI into routine 
      clinical practice and its potential impact on anesthesia education and training 
      are explored, emphasizing the need for collaboration, education, and ethical 
      guidelines. This review provides a comprehensive overview of AI applications in 
      anesthesia, offering insights into the present landscape, challenges, and future 
      directions. The synthesis of historical perspectives, current applications, and 
      future possibilities underscores the transformative potential of AI in 
      revolutionizing patient care within the dynamic field of anesthesia.

TI  - Predicting cellular responses to complex perturbations in high-throughput 
      screens.
PG  - e11517
LID - 10.15252/msb.202211517 [doi]
LID - e11517
AB  - Recent advances in multiplexed single-cell transcriptomics experiments facilitate 
      the high-throughput study of drug and genetic perturbations. However, an 
      exhaustive exploration of the combinatorial perturbation space is experimentally 
      unfeasible. Therefore, computational methods are needed to predict, interpret, 
      and prioritize perturbations. Here, we present the compositional perturbation 
      autoencoder (CPA), which combines the interpretability of linear models with the 
      flexibility of deep-learning approaches for single-cell response modeling. CPA 
      learns to in silico predict transcriptional perturbation response at the 
      single-cell level for unseen dosages, cell types, time points, and species. Using 
      newly generated single-cell drug combination data, we validate that CPA can 
      predict unseen drug combinations while outperforming baseline models. 
      Additionally, the architecture's modularity enables incorporating the chemical 
      representation of the drugs, allowing the prediction of cellular response to 
      completely unseen drugs. Furthermore, CPA is also applicable to genetic 
      combinatorial screens. We demonstrate this by imputing in silico 5,329 missing 
      combinations (97.6% of all possibilities) in a single-cell Perturb-seq experiment 
      with diverse genetic interactions. We envision CPA will facilitate efficient 
      experimental design and hypothesis generation by enabling in silico response 
      prediction at the single-cell level and thus accelerate therapeutic applications 
      using single-cell technologies.

TI  - Exploring the Role of Artificial Intelligence in Smart Healthcare: A Capability 
      and Function-Oriented Review.
LID - 10.3390/healthcare13141642 [doi]
LID - 1642
AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming smart healthcare by enhancing 
      diagnostic precision, automating clinical workflows, and enabling personalized 
      treatment strategies. This review explores the current landscape of AI in 
      healthcare from two key perspectives: capability types (e.g., Narrow AI and AGI) 
      and functional architectures (e.g., Limited Memory and Theory of Mind). Based on 
      capabilities, most AI systems today are categorized as Narrow AI, performing 
      specific tasks such as medical image analysis and risk prediction with high 
      accuracy. More advanced forms like General Artificial Intelligence (AGI) and 
      Superintelligent AI remain theoretical but hold transformative potential. From a 
      functional standpoint, Limited Memory AI dominates clinical applications by 
      learning from historical patient data to inform decision-making. Reactive systems 
      are used in rule-based alerts, while Theory of Mind (ToM) and Self-Aware AI 
      remain conceptual stages for future development. This dual perspective provides a 
      comprehensive framework to assess the maturity, impact, and future direction of 
      AI in healthcare. It also highlights the need for ethical design, transparency, 
      and regulation as AI systems grow more complex and autonomous, by incorporating 
      cross-domain AI insights. Moreover, we evaluate the viability of developing AGI 
      in regionally specific legal and regulatory frameworks, using South Korea as a 
      case study to emphasize the limitations imposed by infrastructural preparedness 
      and medical data governance regulations.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study assesses the application of interpretable machine learning 
      modeling using electronic medical record data for the prediction of conversion to 
      neurological disease. METHODS: A retrospective dataset of Cleveland Clinic 
      patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 
      multiple sclerosis, or Parkinson's disease, and matched controls based on age, 
      sex, race, and ethnicity was compiled. Individualized risk prediction models were 
      created using eXtreme Gradient Boosting for each neurological disease at four 
      timepoints in patient history. The prediction models were assessed for 
      transparency and fairness. RESULTS: At timepoints 0-months, 12-months, 24-months, 
      and 60-months prior to diagnosis, Alzheimer's disease models achieved the area 
      under the receiver operating characteristic curve on a holdout test dataset of 
      0.794, 0.742, 0.709, and 0.645; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis of 0.883, 0.710, 
      0.658, and 0.620; multiple sclerosis of 0.922, 0.877, 0.849, and 0.781; and 
      Parkinson's disease of 0.809, 0.738, 0.700, and 0.651, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The results demonstrate that electronic medical records contain latent 
      information that can be used for risk stratification for neurological disorders. 
      In particular, patient-reported outcomes, sleep assessments, falls data, 
      additional disease diagnoses, and longitudinal changes in patient health, such as 
      weight change, are important predictors.

TI  - A Talk with ChatGPT: The Role of Artificial Intelligence in Shaping the Future of 
      Cardiology and Electrophysiology.
LID - 10.3390/jpm15050205 [doi]
LID - 205
AB  - Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to significantly impact the 
      future of cardiology and electrophysiology, offering new tools to interpret 
      complex datasets, improve diagnosis, optimize clinical workflows, and personalize 
      therapy. ChatGPT-4o, a leading AI-based language model, exemplifies the 
      transformative potential of AI in clinical research, medical education, and 
      patient care. Aim and Methods: In this paper, we present an exploratory dialogue 
      with ChatGPT to assess the role of AI in shaping the future of cardiology, with a 
      particular focus on arrhythmia management and cardiac electrophysiology. Topics 
      discussed include AI applications in ECG interpretation, arrhythmia detection, 
      procedural guidance during ablation, and risk stratification for sudden cardiac 
      death. We also examine the risks associated with AI use, including overreliance, 
      interpretability challenges, data bias, and generalizability. Conclusions: The 
      integration of AI into cardiovascular care offers the potential to enhance 
      diagnostic accuracy, tailor interventions, and support decision-making. However, 
      the adoption of AI must be carefully balanced with clinical expertise and ethical 
      considerations. By fostering collaboration between clinicians and AI developers, 
      it is possible to guide the development of reliable, transparent, and effective 
      tools that will shape the future of personalized cardiology and 
      electrophysiology.

AB  - Cancer has increasingly been recognized as a genetic disease, influenced by 
      lifestyle changes, dietary patterns, and environmental pollutants. Lung cancer 
      remains one of the most lethal malignancies worldwide, necessitating precise 
      diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Among these types, lung cancer is the 
      third most common cancer, which affects all over the population. Lung cancer is a 
      cancer that forms in tissues of the lung, usually in the cells that line the air 
      passages. There are two main types of lung cancer: small cell and non-small cell 
      lung cancer. These two types grow differently and are treated differently. This 
      review explores the application of advanced deep learning (DL) techniques in 
      enhancing biosignature immunotherapy tools for the prediction of immune 
      phenotypes in lung cancer patients. The study systematically analyses recent 
      research integrating multi-modal biomedical data, such as radiomics, genomics, 
      transcriptomics, and histopathological images, to develop robust DL-based 
      predictive models. A well-defined literature search strategy, inclusion/exclusion 
      criteria, and a PRISMA-guided screening process ensure transparency and 
      reproducibility. Emphasis is placed on identifying key predictive biomarkers, 
      including Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, Tumor Mutational Burden 
      (TMB), Microsatellite Instability (MSI), and APOBEC mutational signatures, which 
      are vital for personalizing immunotherapy. The review also incorporates a quality 
      assessment framework to evaluate the methodological rigor of the included 
      studies. Enhanced technical details, such as model architecture, validation 
      strategies, hyperparameter tuning, and standardized performance metrics like 
      AUC-ROC and Harrell's C-index, are presented to facilitate cross-study 
      comparisons. This review underscores the transformative role of DL in precision 
      oncology and highlights the potential for integrating biosignatures into clinical 
      workflows to improve immunotherapy outcomes in lung cancer.

AB  - Precision medicine based on personalized genomics provides promising strategies 
      to enhance the efficacy of molecular-targeted therapies. However, the clinical 
      effectiveness of drugs has been severely limited due to genetic variations that 
      lead to drug resistance. Predicting the impact of missense mutations on clinical 
      drug response is an essential way to reduce the cost of clinical trials and 
      understand genetic diseases. Here, we present Emden, a novel method integrating 
      graph and transformer representations that predicts the effect of missense 
      mutations on drug response through binary classification with interpretability. 
      Emden utilized protein sequences-based features and drug structures as inputs for 
      rapid prediction, employing competitive representation learning and demonstrating 
      strong generalization capabilities and robustness. Our study showed promising 
      potential for clinical drug guidance and deep insight into computer-assisted 
      precision medicine. Emden is freely available as a web server at 
      https://www.psymukb.net/Emden.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the predictive performance of machine 
      learning in predicting the occurrence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome 
      (SIRS) and urosepsis after percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). METHODS: A 
      retrospective analysis was conducted on patients who underwent PCNL treatment 
      between January 2016 and July 2022. Machine learning techniques were employed to 
      establish and select the best predictive model for postoperative systemic 
      infection. The feasibility of using relevant risk factors as predictive markers 
      was explored through interpretability with Machine Learning. RESULTS: A total of 
      1067 PCNL patients were included in this study, with 111 (10.4 %) patients 
      developing SIRS and 49 (4.5 %) patients developing urosepsis. In the validation 
      set, the risk model based on the GBM protocol demonstrated a predictive power of 
      0.871 for SIRS and 0.854 for urosepsis. Preoperative and postoperative platelet 
      changes were identified as the most significant predictors. Both thrombocytopenia 
      and thrombocytosis were found to be risk factors for SIRS or urosepsis after 
      PCNL. Furthermore, it was observed that when the change in platelet count before 
      and after PCNL surgery exceeded 30*109/L (whether an increase or decrease), the 
      risk of developing SIRS or urosepsis significantly increased. CONCLUSION: Machine 
      learning can be effectively utilized for predicting the occurrence of SIRS or 
      urosepsis after PCNL. The changes in platelet count before and after PCNL surgery 
      serve as important predictors.

AB  - Privacy is commonly regarded as a regulatory requirement achieved via technical 
      and organizational management practices. Those working in the field of 
      informatics often play a role in privacy preservation as a result of their 
      expertise in information technology, workflow analysis, implementation science, 
      or related skills. Viewing privacy from the perspective of patients whose 
      protected health information is at risk broadens the considerations to include 
      the perceived duality of privacy; the existence of privacy within a context 
      unique to each patient; the competing needs inherent within privacy management; 
      the need for particular consideration when data are shared; and the need for 
      patients to control health information in a global setting. With precision 
      medicine, artificial intelligence, and other treatment innovations on the 
      horizon, health care professionals need to think more broadly about how to 
      preserve privacy in a health care environment driven by data sharing. 
      Patient-reported privacy preferences, privacy portability, and greater 
      transparency around privacy-preserving functionalities are potential strategies 
      for ensuring that privacy regulations are met and privacy is preserved.

      modalities: Potential treatment management based on the "method-disease-data" 
      axis.
LID - 10.4103/NRR.NRR-D-25-00121 [doi]
AB  - Although many previous studies have highlighted the advances in prediction 
      models, instruments for pathological and histological diagnosis and treatment, as 
      well as individualized treatment modalities in mental disorders, these previous 
      syntheses usually study the research outcomes separately and ignore the holistic 
      integration of research regarding artificial intelligence technological 
      approaches, data sets used and applications in mental health research. We used 
      the BioBERT pretrained language model to systematically extract relevant 
      information and develop an extensive knowledge graph that includes 3158 entities 
      connected with 3248 different relationships. Our knowledge graph delineates 
      essential artificial intelligence technological frameworks and explicitly maps 
      out the relationships linking artificial intelligence methods, mental disorders, 
      and diverse data modalities. The synthesis, centered on the analytical axis of 
      "method-disease-data," highlights key research areas where artificial 
      intelligence and neuropsychiatry meet. Specifically, it focuses on key 
      applications in early detection, improved accuracy of diagnosis, and 
      individualized therapeutic interventions. In addition, we summarized the 
      applications derived from basic research findings that extend to ongoing clinical 
      trials, revealing the path toward future clinical application in psychiatric 
      work. Importantly, the research paid special attention to the application of 
      artificial intelligence in identifying key brain regions and neural circuits, 
      providing important clues for elucidating the neural mechanisms of mental 
      disorders and developing targeted interventions. Although artificial intelligence 
      presents great opportunities, there are also significant challenges, including 
      imbalanced data sets, ethical issues, and clinical concerns about trustworthiness 
      and transparency. Strategies to address these challenges are proposed, and a 
      perspective on emerging methods enabled by artificial intelligence is provided, 
      which are expected to greatly change the management and treatment of the future.

TI  - Development of Clinical Radiomics-Based Models to Predict Survival Outcome in 
      Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma: A Multicenter Retrospective Study.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics14070712 [doi]
LID - 712
AB  - PURPOSE: This multicenter retrospective study aims to identify reliable clinical 
      and radiomic features to build machine learning models that predict 
      progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in pancreatic ductal 
      adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients. METHODS: Between 2010 and 2020 pre-treatment 
      contrast-enhanced CT scans of 287 pathology-confirmed PDAC patients from two 
      sites of the Hopital Universitaire de Bruxelles (HUB) and from 47 hospitals 
      within the HUB network were retrospectively analysed. Demographic, clinical, and 
      survival data were also collected. Gross tumour volume (GTV) and non-tumoral 
      pancreas (RPV) were semi-manually segmented and radiomics features were 
      extracted. Patients from two HUB sites comprised the training dataset, while 
      those from the remaining 47 hospitals of the HUB network constituted the testing 
      dataset. A three-step method was used for feature selection. Based on the 
      GradientBoostingSurvivalAnalysis classifier, different machine learning models 
      were trained and tested to predict OS and PFS. Model performances were assessed 
      using the C-index and Kaplan-Meier curves. SHAP analysis was applied to allow for 
      post hoc interpretability. RESULTS: A total of 107 radiomics features were 
      extracted from each of the GTV and RPV. Fourteen subgroups of features were 
      selected: clinical, GTV, RPV, clinical & GTV, clinical & GTV & RPV, GTV-volume 
      and RPV-volume both for OS and PFS. Subsequently, 14 Gradient Boosting Survival 
      Analysis models were trained and tested. In the testing dataset, the clinical & 
      GTV model demonstrated the highest performance for OS (C-index: 0.72) among all 
      other models, while for PFS, the clinical model exhibited a superior performance 
      (C-index: 0.70). CONCLUSIONS: An integrated approach, combining clinical and 
      radiomics features, excels in predicting OS, whereas clinical features 
      demonstrate strong performance in PFS prediction.

AB  - Prognostic survival prediction in colorectal cancer (CRC) plays a crucial role in 
      guiding treatment decisions and improving patient outcomes. In this research, we 
      explore the application of deep learning techniques to predict survival outcomes 
      based on histopathological images of human colorectal cancer. We present a 
      retrospective multicenter study utilizing a dataset of 100,000 nonoverlapping 
      image patches from hematoxylin & eosin-stained histological images of CRC and 
      normal tissue. The dataset includes diverse tissue classes such as adipose, 
      background, debris, lymphocytes, mucus, smooth muscle, normal colon mucosa, 
      cancer-associated stroma, and colorectal adenocarcinoma epithelium. To perform 
      survival prediction, we employ various deep learning architectures, including 
      convolutional neural network, DenseNet201, InceptionResNetV2, VGG16, VGG19, and 
      Xception. These architectures are trained on the dataset using a multicenter 
      retrospective analysis approach. Extensive preprocessing steps are undertaken, 
      including image normalization using Macenko's method and data augmentation 
      techniques, to optimize model performance. The experimental findings reveal 
      promising results, demonstrating the effectiveness of deep learning models in 
      prognostic survival prediction. Our models achieve high accuracy, precision, 
      recall, and validation metrics, showcasing their ability to capture relevant 
      histological patterns associated with prognosis. Visualization techniques are 
      employed to interpret the models' decision-making process, highlighting important 
      features and regions contributing to survival predictions. The implications of 
      this research are manifold. The accurate prediction of survival outcomes in CRC 
      can aid in personalized medicine and clinical decision-making, facilitating 
      tailored treatment plans for individual patients. The identification of important 
      histological features and biomarkers provides valuable insights into disease 
      mechanisms and may lead to the discovery of novel prognostic indicators. The 
      transparency and explainability of the models enhance trust and acceptance, 
      fostering their integration into clinical practice. Research demonstrates the 
      potential of deep learning models for prognostic survival prediction in human 
      colorectal cancer histology. The findings contribute to the understanding of 
      disease progression and offer practical applications in personalized medicine. By 
      harnessing the power of deep learning and histopathological analysis, we pave the 
      way for improved patient care, clinical decision support, and advancements in 
      prognostic prediction in CRC.

LID - arXiv:2410.23425v1
AB  - Understanding the genetic basis of complex traits is a longstanding challenge in 
      the field of genomics. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 
      thousands of variant-trait associations, but most of these variants are located 
      in non-coding regions, making the link to biological function elusive. While 
      traditional approaches, such as transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), 
      have advanced our understanding by linking genetic variants to gene expression, 
      they often overlook gene-gene interactions. Here, we review current approaches to 
      integrate different molecular data, leveraging machine learning methods to 
      identify gene modules based on co-expression and functional relationships. These 
      integrative approaches, like PhenoPLIER, combine TWAS and drug-induced 
      transcriptional profiles to effectively capture biologically meaningful gene 
      networks. This integration provides a context-specific understanding of disease 
      processes while highlighting both core and peripheral genes. These insights pave 
      the way for novel therapeutic targets and enhance the interpretability of genetic 
      studies in personalized medicine.

AB  - Despite available vaccinations COVID-19 case numbers around the world are still 
      growing, and effective medications against severe cases are lacking. In this 
      work, we developed a machine learning model which predicts mortality for COVID-19 
      patients using data from the multi-center 'Lean European Open Survey on 
      SARS-CoV-2-infected patients' (LEOSS) observational study (>100 active sites in 
      Europe, primarily in Germany), resulting into an AUC of almost 80%. We showed 
      that molecular mechanisms related to dementia, one of the relevant predictors in 
      our model, intersect with those associated to COVID-19. Most notably, among these 
      molecules was tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), a protein that has been patented as drug 
      target in Alzheimer's Disease but also genetically associated with severe 
      COVID-19 outcomes. We experimentally verified that anti-cancer drugs Sorafenib 
      and Regorafenib showed a clear anti-cytopathic effect in Caco2 and VERO-E6 cells 
      and can thus be regarded as potential treatments against COVID-19. Altogether, 
      our work demonstrates that interpretation of machine learning based risk models 
      can point towards drug targets and new treatment options, which are strongly 
      needed for COVID-19.

AB  - Traditional image-based survival prediction models rely on discriminative patch 
      labeling which make those methods not scalable to extend to large datasets. 
      Recent studies have shown Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) framework is useful 
      for histopathological images when no annotations are available in classification 
      task. Different to the current image-based survival models that limit to key 
      patches or clusters derived from Whole Slide Images (WSIs), we propose Deep 
      Attention Multiple Instance Survival Learning (DeepAttnMISL) by introducing both 
      siamese MI-FCN and attention-based MIL pooling to efficiently learn imaging 
      features from the WSI and then aggregate WSI-level information to patient-level. 
      Attention-based aggregation is more flexible and adaptive than aggregation 
      techniques in recent survival models. We evaluated our methods on two large 
      cancer whole slide images datasets and our results suggest that the proposed 
      approach is more effective and suitable for large datasets and has better 
      interpretability in locating important patterns and features that contribute to 
      accurate cancer survival predictions. The proposed framework can also be used to 
      assess individual patient's risk and thus assisting in delivering personalized 
      medicine.

TI  - Machine learning for prediction of childhood mental health problems in social 
      care.
PG  - e86
LID - 10.1192/bjo.2025.32 [doi]
LID - e86
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rates of childhood mental health problems are increasing in the UK. 
      Early identification of childhood mental health problems is challenging but 
      critical to children's future psychosocial development. This is particularly 
      important for children with social care contact because earlier identification 
      can facilitate earlier intervention. Clinical prediction tools could improve 
      these early intervention efforts. AIMS: Characterise a novel cohort consisting of 
      children in social care and develop effective machine learning models for 
      prediction of childhood mental health problems. METHOD: We used linked, 
      de-identified data from the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage Databank to 
      create a cohort of 26 820 children in Wales, UK, receiving social care services. 
      Integrating health, social care and education data, we developed several machine 
      learning models aimed at predicting childhood mental health problems. We assessed 
      the performance, interpretability and fairness of these models. RESULTS: Risk 
      factors strongly associated with childhood mental health problems included age, 
      substance misuse and being a looked after child. The best-performing model, a 
      gradient boosting classifier, achieved an area under the receiver operating 
      characteristic curve of 0.75 (95% CI 0.73-0.78). Assessments of algorithmic 
      fairness showed potential biases within these models. CONCLUSIONS: Machine 
      learning performance on this prediction task was promising. Predictive 
      performance in social care settings can be bolstered by linking diverse routinely 
      collected data-sets, making available a range of heterogenous risk factors 
      relating to clinical, social and environmental exposures.

TI  - An interpretable stacking ensemble learning framework based on multi-dimensional 
      data for real-time prediction of drug concentration: The example of olanzapine.
PG  - 975855
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2022.975855 [doi]
LID - 975855
AB  - Background and Aim: Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) has evolved over the years 
      as an important tool for personalized medicine. Nevertheless, some limitations 
      are associated with traditional TDM. Emerging data-driven model forecasting 
      [e.g., through machine learning (ML)-based approaches] has been used for 
      individualized therapy. This study proposes an interpretable stacking-based ML 
      framework to predict concentrations in real time after olanzapine (OLZ) 
      treatment. Methods: The TDM-OLZ dataset, consisting of 2,142 OLZ measurements and 
      472 features, was formed by collecting electronic health records during the TDM 
      of 927 patients who had received OLZ treatment. We compared the performance of ML 
      algorithms by using 10-fold cross-validation and the mean absolute error (MAE). 
      The optimal subset of features was analyzed by a random forest-based sequential 
      forward feature selection method in the context of the top five heterogeneous 
      regressors as base models to develop a stacked ensemble regressor, which was then 
      optimized via the grid search method. Its predictions were explained by using 
      local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) and partial dependence 
      plots (PDPs). Results: A state-of-the-art stacking ensemble learning framework 
      that integrates optimized extra trees, XGBoost, random forest, bagging, and 
      gradient-boosting regressors was developed for nine selected features [i.e., 
      daily dose (OLZ), gender_male, age, valproic acid_yes, ALT, K, BW, MONO#, and 
      time of blood sampling after first administration]. It outperformed other base 
      regressors that were considered, with an MAE of 0.064, R-square value of 0.5355, 
      mean squared error of 0.0089, mean relative error of 13%, and ideal rate (the 
      percentages of predicted TDM within ± 30% of actual TDM) of 63.40%. Predictions 
      at the individual level were illustrated by LIME plots, whereas the global 
      interpretation of associations between features and outcomes was illustrated by 
      PDPs. Conclusion: This study highlights the feasibility of the real-time 
      estimation of drug concentrations by using stacking-based ML strategies without 
      losing interpretability, thus facilitating model-informed precision dosing.

TI  - Understanding Sources of Variation to Improve the Reproducibility of Radiomics.
PG  - 633176
LID - 10.3389/fonc.2021.633176 [doi]
LID - 633176
AB  - Radiomics is the method of choice for investigating the association between 
      cancer imaging phenotype, cancer genotype and clinical outcome prediction in the 
      era of precision medicine. The fast dispersal of this new methodology has 
      benefited from the existing advances of the core technologies involved in 
      radiomics workflow: image acquisition, tumor segmentation, feature extraction and 
      machine learning. However, despite the rapidly increasing body of publications, 
      there is no real clinical use of a developed radiomics signature so far. Reasons 
      are multifaceted. One of the major challenges is the lack of reproducibility and 
      generalizability of the reported radiomics signatures (features and models). 
      Sources of variation exist in each step of the workflow; some are controllable or 
      can be controlled to certain degrees, while others are uncontrollable or even 
      unknown. Insufficient transparency in reporting radiomics studies further 
      prevents translation of the developed radiomics signatures from the bench to the 
      bedside. This review article first addresses sources of variation, which is 
      illustrated using demonstrative examples. Then, it reviews a number of published

TI  - An interpretable machine learning model for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - e6543

AB  - We present an interpretable machine learning model for medical diagnosis called 
      sparse high-order interaction model with rejection option (SHIMR). A decision 
      tree explains to a patient the diagnosis with a long rule (i.e., conjunction of 
      many intervals), while SHIMR employs a weighted sum of short rules. Using 
      proteomics data of 151 subjects in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
      Initiative (ADNI) dataset, SHIMR is shown to be as accurate as other 
      non-interpretable methods (Sensitivity, SN = 0.84 ± 0.1, Specificity, SP = 0.69 ± 
      0.15 and Area Under the Curve, AUC = 0.86 ± 0.09). For clinical usage, SHIMR has 
      a function to abstain from making any diagnosis when it is not confident enough, 
      so that a medical doctor can choose more accurate but invasive and/or more costly 
      pathologies. The incorporation of a rejection option complements SHIMR in 
      designing a multistage cost-effective diagnosis framework. Using a baseline 
      concentration of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma proteins from a common 
      cohort of 141 subjects, SHIMR is shown to be effective in designing a 
      patient-specific cost-effective Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Thus, 
      interpretability, reliability and having the potential to design a 
      patient-specific multistage cost-effective diagnosis framework can make SHIMR 
      serve as an indispensable tool in the era of precision medicine that can cater to 
      the demand of both doctors and patients, and reduce the overwhelming financial 
      burden of medical diagnosis.

TI  - ChatGPT-4 and the Global Burden of Disease Study: Advancing Personalized 
      Healthcare Through Artificial Intelligence in Clinical and Translational 
      Medicine.
PG  - e39384
LID - 10.7759/cureus.39384 [doi]
LID - e39384
AB  - The fusion of insights from the comprehensive global burden of disease (GBD) 
      study and the advanced artificial intelligence of open artificial intelligence 
      (AI) chat generative pre-trained transformer version 4 (ChatGPT-4) brings the 
      potential to transform personalized healthcare planning. By integrating the 
      data-driven findings of the GBD study with the powerful conversational 
      capabilities of ChatGPT-4, healthcare professionals can devise customized 
      healthcare plans that are adapted to patients' lifestyles and preferences. We 
      propose that this innovative partnership can lead to the creation of a novel 
      AI-assisted personalized disease burden (AI-PDB) assessment and planning tool. 
      For the successful implementation of this unconventional technology, it is 
      crucial to ensure continuous and accurate updates, expert supervision, and 
      address potential biases and limitations. Healthcare professionals and 
      stakeholders should have a balanced and dynamic approach, emphasizing 
      interdisciplinary collaborations, data accuracy, transparency, ethical 
      compliance, and ongoing training. By investing in the unique strengths of both 
      ChatGPT-4, especially its newly introduced features such as live internet 
      browsing or plugins, and the GBD study, we may enhance personalized healthcare 
      planning. This innovative approach has the potential to improve patient outcomes 
      and optimize resource utilization, as well as pave the way for the worldwide 
      implementation of precision medicine, thereby revolutionizing the existing 
      healthcare landscape. However, to fully harness these benefits at both the global 
      and individual levels, further research and development are warranted. This will 
      ensure that we effectively tap into the potential of this synergy, bringing 
      societies closer to a future where personalized healthcare is the norm rather 
      than the exception.

AB  - Accurate time-to-event (TTE) prediction of clinical outcomes from personal 
      biomedical data is essential for precision medicine. It has become increasingly 
      common that clinical datasets contain information for multiple related patient 
      outcomes from comorbid diseases or multifaceted endpoints of a single disease. 
      Various TTE models have been developed to handle competing risks that are related 
      to mutually exclusive events. However, clinical outcomes are often non-competing 
      and can occur at the same time or sequentially. Here we develop TTE prediction 
      models with the capacity of incorporating compatible related clinical outcomes. 
      We test our method on real and synthetic data and find that the incorporation of 
      related auxiliary clinical outcomes can: 1) significantly improve the TTE 
      prediction performance of conventional Cox model while maintaining its 
      interpretability; 2) further improve the performance of the state-of-the-art deep 
      learning based models. While the auxiliary outcomes are utilized for model 
      training, the model deployment is not limited by the availability of the 
      auxiliary outcome data because the auxiliary outcome information is not required 
      for the prediction of the primary outcome once the model is trained.

TI  - Self supervised artificial intelligence predicts poor outcome from primary 
      cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma at diagnosis.
PG  - 105

AB  - Primary cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is responsible for ~10,000 
      deaths annually in the United States. Stratification of risk of poor outcome at 
      initial biopsy would significantly impact clinical decision-making during the 
      initial post operative period where intervention has been shown to be most 
      effective. Using whole-slide images (WSI) from 163 patients from 3 institutions, 
      we developed a self supervised deep-learning model to predict poor outcomes in 
      cSCC patients from histopathological features at initial diagnosis, and validated 
      it using WSI from 563 patients, collected from two other academic institutions. 
      For disease-free survival prediction, the model attained a concordance index of 
      0.73 in the development cohort and 0.84 in the Mayo cohort. The model's 
      interpretability revealed that features like poor differentiation and deep 
      invasion were strongly associated with poor prognosis. Furthermore, the model is 
      effective in stratifying risk among BWH T2a and AJCC T2, known for outcome 
      heterogeneity.

      states influenced by genetic, environmental, physiological, and psychological 
      factors. Traditional Chinese Medicine categorizes health into nine body 
      constitutional types, each reflecting unique balances or imbalances in vital 
      energies, influencing physical, mental, and emotional states. Advances in machine 
      learning models offer promising avenues for diagnosing conditions like 
      Alzheimer's, dementia, and respiratory diseases by analyzing speech patterns, 
      enabling complementary non-invasive disease diagnosis. The study aims to use 
      speech audio to identify subhealth populations characterized by unbalanced 
      constitution types. METHODS: Participants, aged 18-45, were selected from the 
      Acoustic Study of Health. Audio recordings were collected using ATR2500X-USB 
      microphones and Praat software. Exclusion criteria included recent illness, 
      dental issues, and specific medical histories. The audio data were preprocessed 
      to Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) for model training. Three deep 
      learning models-1-Dimensional Convolution Network (Conv1D), 2-Dimensional 
      Convolution Network (Conv2D), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-were implemented 
      using Python to classify health status. Saliency maps were generated to provide 
      model explainability. RESULTS: The study used 1,378 recordings from balanced 
      (healthy) and 1,413 from unbalanced (subhealth) types. The Conv1D model achieved 
      a training accuracy of 91.91% and validation accuracy of 84.19%. The Conv2D model 
      had 96.19% training accuracy and 84.93% validation accuracy. The LSTM model 
      showed 92.79% training accuracy and 87.13% validation accuracy, with early signs 
      of overfitting. AUC scores were 0.92 and 0.94 (Conv1D), 0.99 (Conv2D), and 0.97 
      (LSTM). All models demonstrated robust performance, with Conv2D excelling in 
      discrimination accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: The deep learning classification of human 
      speech audio for health status using body constitution types showed promising 
      results with Conv1D, Conv2D, and LSTM models. Analysis of ROC curves, training 
      accuracy, and validation accuracy showed all models robustly distinguished 
      between balanced and unbalanced constitution types. Conv2D excelled with good 
      accuracy, while Conv1D and LSTM also performed well, affirming their reliability. 
      The study integrates constitution theory and deep learning technologies to 
      classify subhealth populations using noninvasive approach, thereby promoting 
      personalized medicine and early intervention strategies.

AB  - Medical Laboratory Data (MLD) models, which combine artificial intelligence with 
      big medical data, have great potential in disease screening, diagnosis, 
      personalized medicine, and health management. This study thoroughly examines the 
      opportunities, challenges, and solutions in this field. The use of large-scale 
      MLD improves diagnostic accuracy and allows for real-time disease monitoring. 
      Additionally, integrating social and environmental data enables the analysis of 
      disease mechanisms and trends. Despite these benefits, challenges such as data 
      quality, model optimization, computational requirements, and limited 
      interpretability remain, along with concerns about data privacy, fairness, and 
      security. Proposed solutions include establishing standardized data formats, 
      utilizing deep learning frameworks, employing distributed computing, improving 
      interpretability, and implementing techniques like federated learning and 
      algorithm optimization to address bias and safeguard privacy. Future directions 
      will focus on enhancing performance in specific scenarios, expanding applications 
      across different domains, increasing transparency, enabling real-time processing, 
      and building a supportive ecosystem. It is essential to strengthen policy 
      oversight and promote collaboration among governments, medical institutions, and 
      academia to ensure that technological advancements align with societal progress.

AB  - The computational pathology has been demonstrated to effectively uncover 
      tumor-related genomic alterations and transcriptomic patterns. Although 
      proteomics has indeed shown great potential in the field of precision medicine, 
      few studies have focused on the computational prediction of protein levels from 
      pathology images. In this paper, we assume that deep learning-based pathological 
      features imply the protein levels of tumor biomarkers that are indicative of 
      prognosis and drug response. For this purpose, we propose wsi2rppa, a weakly 
      supervised contrastive learning framework to infer the protein levels of tumor 
      biomarkers from whole slide images (WSIs) in breast cancer. We first conducted 
      contrastive learning-based pre-training on tessellated tiles to extract 
      pathological features, which are then aggregated by attention pooling and adapted 
      to downstream tasks. We conducted extensive evaluation experiments on the 
      TCGA-BRCA cohort (1978 WSIs of 1093 patients with protein levels of 223 
      biomarkers) and the CPTAC-BRCA cohort (642 WSIs of 134 patients). The results 
      showed that our method achieved state-of-the-art performance in tumor diagnostic 
      tasks, and also performed well in predicting clinically relevant protein levels 
      and drug response. To show the model interpretability, we spatially visualized 
      the WSIs colored the tiles by their attention scores, and found that the regions 
      with high scores were highly consistent with the tumor and necrotic regions 
      annotated by a 10-year experienced pathologist. Moreover, spatial transcriptomic 
      data further verified that the heatmap generated by attention scores agrees 
      greatly with the spatial expression landscape of two typical tumor biomarker 
      genes. In predicting the response to drug trastuzumab treatment, our method 
      achieved a 0.79 AUC value which is much higher than the previous study reported 
      0.68. These findings showed the remarkable potential of computational pathology 
      in the prediction of clinically relevant protein levels, drug response, and 
      clinical outcomes.

AB  - Bioinformatics has taken a pivotal place in the life sciences field. Not only 
      does it improve, but it also fine-tunes and complements the wet lab experiments. 
      It has been a driving force in the so-called biological sciences, converting them 
      into hypothesis and data-driven fields. This study highlights the translational 
      impact of bioinformatics on experimental biology and discusses its evolution and 
      the advantages it has brought to advancing biological research. Computational 
      analyses make labor-intensive wet lab work cost-effective by reducing the use of 
      expensive reagents. Genome/proteome-wide studies have become feasible due to the 
      efficiency and speed of bioinformatics tools, which can hardly be compared with 
      wet lab experiments. Computational methods provide the scalability essential for 
      manipulating large and complex data of biological origin. AI-integrated 
      bioinformatics studies can unveil important biological patterns that traditional 
      approaches may otherwise overlook. Bioinformatics contributes to hypothesis 
      formation and experiment design, which is pivotal for modern-day multi-omics and 
      systems biology studies. Integrating bioinformatics in the experimental 
      procedures increases reproducibility and helps reduce human errors. Although 
      today's AI-integrated bioinformatics predictions have significantly improved in 
      accuracy over the years, wet lab validation is still unavoidable for confirming 
      these predictions. Challenges persist in multi-omics data integration and 
      analysis, AI model interpretability, and multiscale modeling. Addressing these 
      shortcomings through the latest developments is essential for advancing our 
      knowledge of disease mechanisms, therapeutic strategies, and precision medicine.

TI  - Urgency Prediction for Medical Laboratory Tests Through Optimal Sparse Decision 
      Tree: Case Study With Echocardiograms.
PG  - e64188
LID - 10.2196/64188 [doi]
LID - e64188
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the contemporary realm of health care, laboratory tests stand as 
      cornerstone components, driving the advancement of precision medicine. These 
      tests offer intricate insights into a variety of medical conditions, thereby 
      facilitating diagnosis, prognosis, and treatments. However, the accessibility of 
      certain tests is hindered by factors such as high costs, a shortage of 
      specialized personnel, or geographic disparities, posing obstacles to achieving 
      equitable health care. For example, an echocardiogram is a type of laboratory 
      test that is extremely important and not easily accessible. The increasing demand 
      for echocardiograms underscores the imperative for more efficient scheduling 
      protocols. Despite this pressing need, limited research has been conducted in 
      this area. OBJECTIVE: The study aims to develop an interpretable machine learning 
      model for determining the urgency of patients requiring echocardiograms, thereby 
      aiding in the prioritization of scheduling procedures. Furthermore, this study 
      aims to glean insights into the pivotal attributes influencing the prioritization 
      of echocardiogram appointments, leveraging the high interpretability of the 
      machine learning model. METHODS: Empirical and predictive analyses have been 
      conducted to assess the urgency of patients based on a large real-world 
      echocardiogram appointment dataset (ie, 34,293 appointments) sourced from 
      electronic health records encompassing administrative information, referral 
      diagnosis, and underlying patient conditions. We used a state-of-the-art 
      interpretable machine learning algorithm, the optimal sparse decision tree 
      (OSDT), renowned for its high accuracy and interpretability, to investigate the 
      attributes pertinent to echocardiogram appointments. RESULTS: The method 
      demonstrated satisfactory performance (F(1)-score=36.18% with an improvement of 
      1.7% and F(2)-score=28.18% with an improvement of 0.79% by the best-performing 
      baseline model) in comparison to the best-performing baseline model. Moreover, 
      due to its high interpretability, the results provide valuable medical insights 
      regarding the identification of urgent patients for tests through the extraction 
      of decision rules from the OSDT model. CONCLUSIONS: The method demonstrated 
      state-of-the-art predictive performance, affirming its effectiveness. 
      Furthermore, we validate the decision rules derived from the OSDT model by 
      comparing them with established medical knowledge. These interpretable results 
      (eg, attribute importance and decision rules from the OSDT model) underscore the 
      potential of our approach in prioritizing patient urgency for echocardiogram 
      appointments and can be extended to prioritize other laboratory test appointments 
      using electronic health record data.

TI  - An explainable artificial intelligence approach for predicting cardiovascular 
      outcomes using electronic health records.

AB  - Understanding the conditionally-dependent clinical variables that drive 
      cardiovascular health outcomes is a major challenge for precision medicine. Here, 
      we deploy a recently developed massively scalable comorbidity discovery method 
      called Poisson Binomial based Comorbidity discovery (PBC), to analyze Electronic 
      Health Records (EHRs) from the University of Utah and Primary Children's Hospital 
      (over 1.6 million patients and 77 million visits) for comorbid diagnoses, 
      procedures, and medications. Using explainable Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
      methodologies, we then tease apart the intertwined, conditionally-dependent 
      impacts of comorbid conditions and demography upon cardiovascular health, 
      focusing on the key areas of heart transplant, sinoatrial node dysfunction and 
      various forms of congenital heart disease. The resulting multimorbidity networks 
      make possible wide-ranging explorations of the comorbid and demographic 
      landscapes surrounding these cardiovascular outcomes, and can be distributed as 
      web-based tools for further community-based outcomes research. The ability to 
      transform enormous collections of EHRs into compact, portable tools devoid of 
      Protected Health Information solves many of the legal, technological, and 
      data-scientific challenges associated with large-scale EHR analyses.

AB  - Cancer exhibits substantial heterogeneity, manifesting as distinct morphological 
      and molecular variations across tumors, which frequently undermines the efficacy 
      of conventional oncological treatments. Developments in multiomics and sequencing 
      technologies have paved the way for unraveling this heterogeneity. Nevertheless, 
      the complexity of the data gathered from these methods cannot be fully 
      interpreted through multimodal data analysis alone. Mathematical modeling plays a 
      crucial role in delineating the underlying mechanisms to explain sources of 
      heterogeneity using patient-specific data. Intra-tumoral diversity necessitates 
      the development of precision oncology therapies utilizing multiphysics, 
      multiscale mathematical models for cancer. This review discusses recent 
      advancements in computational methodologies for precision oncology, highlighting 
      the potential of cancer digital twins to enhance patient-specific decision-making 
      in clinical settings. We review computational efforts in building 
      patient-informed cellular and tissue-level models for cancer and propose a 
      computational framework that utilizes agent-based modeling as an effective 
      conduit to integrate cancer systems models that encode signaling at the cellular 
      scale with digital twin models that predict tissue-level response in a tumor 
      microenvironment customized to patient information. Furthermore, we discuss 
      machine learning approaches to building surrogates for these complex mathematical 
      models. These surrogates can potentially be used to conduct sensitivity analysis, 
      verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification, which is especially 
      important for tumor studies due to their dynamic nature.

TI  - Machine Learning for Personalized Prediction of Electrocardiogram (EKG) Use in 
      Emergency Care.
LID - 10.3390/jpm15080358 [doi]
LID - 358
AB  - Background: Electrocardiograms (EKGs) are essential tools in emergency medicine, 
      often used to evaluate chest pain, dyspnea, and other symptoms suggestive of 
      cardiac dysfunction. Yet, EKGs are not universally administered to all emergency 
      department (ED) patients. Understanding and predicting which patients receive an 
      EKG may offer insights into clinical decision making, resource allocation, and 
      potential disparities in care. This study examines whether integrating structured 
      clinical data with free-text patient narratives can improve prediction of EKG 
      utilization in the ED. Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational study 
      to predict electrocardiogram (EKG) utilization using data from 13,115 adult 
      emergency department (ED) visits in the nationally representative 2021 National 
      Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey-Emergency Department (NHAMCS-ED), 
      leveraging both structured features-demographics, vital signs, comorbidities, 
      arrival mode, and triage acuity, with the most influential selected via Lasso 
      regression-and unstructured patient narratives transformed into numerical 
      embeddings using Clinical-BERT. Four supervised learning models-Logistic 
      Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF) and Extreme 
      Gradient Boosting (XGB)-were trained on three inputs (structured data only, text 
      embeddings only, and a late-fusion combined model); hyperparameters were 
      optimized by grid search with 5-fold cross-validation; performance was evaluated 
      via AUROC, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and precision; and interpretability 
      was assessed using SHAP values and Permutation Feature Importance. Results: EKGs 
      were administered in 30.6% of adult ED visits. Patients who received EKGs were 
      more likely to be older, White, Medicare-insured, and to present with abnormal 
      vital signs or higher triage severity. Across all models, the combined data 
      approach yielded superior predictive performance. The SVM and LR achieved the 
      highest area under the ROC curve (AUC = 0.860 and 0.861) when using both 
      structured and unstructured data, compared to 0.772 with structured data alone 
      and 0.823 and 0.822 with unstructured data alone. Similar improvements were 
      observed in accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Conclusions: Integrating 
      structured clinical data with patient narratives significantly enhances the 
      ability to predict EKG utilization in the emergency department. These findings 
      support a personalized medicine framework by demonstrating how multimodal data 
      integration can enable individualized, real-time decision support in the ED.

AB  - Breast cancer (BC) remains a significant threat to women's health worldwide. The 
      oncology field had an exponential growth in the abundance of medical images, 
      clinical information, and genomic data. With its continuous advancement and 
      refinement, artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated exceptional 
      capabilities in processing intricate multidimensional BC-related data. AI has 
      proven advantageous in various facets of BC management, encompassing efficient 
      screening and diagnosis, precise prognosis assessment, and personalized treatment 
      planning. However, the implementation of AI into precision medicine and clinical 
      practice presents ongoing challenges that necessitate enhanced regulation, 
      transparency, fairness, and integration of multiple clinical pathways. In this 
      review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current research related to AI 
      in BC, highlighting its extensive applications throughout the whole BC cycle 
      management and its potential for innovative impact. Furthermore, this article 
      emphasizes the significance of constructing patient-oriented AI algorithms. 
      Additionally, we explore the opportunities and potential research directions 
      within this burgeoning field.

      the current state of multimodal integration in health care, spanning clinical 
      applications, current challenges, and future directions. We focus primarily on 
      its applications across different disease domains, particularly in oncology and 
      ophthalmology. Other diseases are briefly discussed due to the few available 
      literature. In oncology, the integration of multimodal data enables more precise 
      tumor characterization and personalized treatment plans. Multimodal fusion 
      demonstrates accurate prediction of anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 
      therapy response (area under the curve=0.91). In ophthalmology, multimodal 
      integration through the combination of genetic and imaging data facilitates the 
      early diagnosis of retinal diseases. However, substantial challenges remain 
      regarding data standardization, model deployment, and model interpretability. We 
      also highlight the future directions of multimodal integration, including its 
      expanded disease applications, such as neurological and otolaryngological 
      diseases, and the trend toward large-scale multimodal models, which enhance 
      accuracy. Overall, the innovative potential of multimodal integration is expected 
      to further revolutionize the health care industry, providing more comprehensive 
      and personalized solutions for disease management.

AB  - Predictive modeling of neuroimaging data (predictive neuroimaging) for evaluating 
      individual differences in various behavioral phenotypes and clinical outcomes is 
      of growing interest. However, the field is experiencing challenges regarding the 
      interpretability of the results. Approaches to defining the specific contribution 
      of functional connections, regions, or networks in prediction models are urgently 
      needed, which may help explore the underlying mechanisms. In this article, we 
      systematically review the methods and applications for interpreting brain 
      signatures derived from predictive neuroimaging based on a survey of 326 research 
      articles. Strengths, limitations, and the suitable conditions for major 
      interpretation strategies are also deliberated. In-depth discussion of common 
      issues in existing literature and the corresponding recommendations to address 
      these pitfalls are provided. We highly recommend exhaustive validation on the 
      reliability and interpretability of the biomarkers across multiple datasets and 
      contexts, which thereby could translate technical advances in neuroimaging into 
      concrete improvements in precision medicine.

TI  - Interpretable machine learning models for predicting in-hospital mortality in 
      patients with chronic critical illness and heart failure: A multicenter study.
PG  - 20552076251347785
LID - 10.1177/20552076251347785 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a primary contributor to morbidity and 
      mortality among patients in intensive care units (ICUs), particularly those 
      experiencing chronic critical illness (CCI). This study aims to develop and 
      validate a machine learning (ML) model for predicting in-hospital mortality in 
      CCI patients with HF. METHODS: Retrospective data from over 200 hospitals were 
      sourced from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III), 
      MIMIC-IV, and the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD). Only patients 
      diagnosed with both CCI and HF were included. The MIMIC datasets served as the 
      derivation cohort, while the eICU-CRD dataset was used for external validation. 
      Key predictive variables were identified through recursive feature elimination. A 
      range of ML algorithms, including random forest, K-nearest neighbors, and support 
      vector machine (SVM), were evaluated alongside four other models. Model 
      performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating 
      characteristic curve (AUROC). Model interpretability was enhanced through SHapley 
      Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations. 
      RESULTS: A total of 780 and 610 patients with CCI and HF were assigned to the 
      derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. Eleven features were selected 
      for model development. The SVM model demonstrated substantial predictive 
      accuracy, with AUROC values of 0.781 and 0.675 in the derivation and validation 
      cohorts. Feature importance analysis using SHAP identified Sequential Organ 
      Failure Assessment score, oxyhemoglobin saturation, and blood pressure as key 
      predictors. CONCLUSION: The SVM model developed reliably predicts in-hospital 
      mortality in patients with CCI and HF, offering a valuable tool for early 
      intervention and enhanced patient management.

TI  - Current Trends and Future Directions of Digital Pathology and Artificial 
      Intelligence in Dermatopathology: A Scientometric-Based Review.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics15172196 [doi]
LID - 2196
AB  - Background: Digital Pathology (DP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have strongly 
      developed in recent years, especially in pathology, with a high interest in 
      dermatopathology. Accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, DP and AI are now 
      integrated in pathology, research and education, bringing value to 
      histopathological diagnoses, telepathology and personalized medicine. This 
      narrative review presents a comprehensive literature review by defining three 
      research directions, using scientometric analysis, of the current state of DP and 
      AI in pathology and dermatopathology. Methods: The research was conducted through 
      the Pubmed and Web of Science databases, within the research period of January 
      2019-July 2025: a two-phase methodology. Four independent pathologists selected 
      the articles in accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the 
      synthesis of the articles was based on three research directions. Results: The 
      research shows that CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), AI powered diagnostic 
      platforms and telepathology strongly contribute to increasing the speed and 
      accuracy of diagnostics, especially on cutaneous malignant skin tumors. There are 
      still several challenges and limitations in terms of validation, 
      interoperability, initial high implementation costs, ethics and transparency in 
      AI and equity in healthcare. Conclusions: DP and AI are essential pillars of 
      modern dermatopathology, with a high necessity of standardization, regulation and 
      a multidisciplinary approach.

TI  - Integrating AI into Cancer Immunotherapy-A Narrative Review of Current 
      Applications and Future Directions.
LID - 10.3390/diseases13010024 [doi]
LID - 24
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cancer remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. 
      Traditional treatments like chemotherapy and radiation often result in 
      significant side effects and varied patient outcomes. Immunotherapy has emerged 
      as a promising alternative, harnessing the immune system to target cancer cells. 
      However, the complexity of immune responses and tumor heterogeneity challenges 
      its effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: This mini-narrative review explores the role of 
      artificial intelligence [AI] in enhancing the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy, 
      predicting patient responses, and discovering novel therapeutic targets. METHODS: 
      A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted, focusing on studies 
      published between 2010 and 2024 that examined the application of AI in cancer 
      immunotherapy. Databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science were 
      utilized, and articles were selected based on relevance to the topic. RESULTS: AI 
      has significantly contributed to identifying biomarkers that predict 
      immunotherapy efficacy by analyzing genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data. 
      It also optimizes combination therapies by predicting the most effective 
      treatment protocols. AI-driven predictive models help assess patient response to 
      immunotherapy, guiding clinical decision-making and minimizing side effects. 
      Additionally, AI facilitates the discovery of novel therapeutic targets, such as 
      neoantigens, enabling the development of personalized immunotherapies. 
      CONCLUSIONS: AI holds immense potential in transforming cancer immunotherapy. 
      However, challenges related to data privacy, algorithm transparency, and clinical 
      integration must be addressed. Overcoming these hurdles will likely make AI a 
      central component of future cancer immunotherapy, offering more personalized and 
      effective treatments.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Primary results from randomized clinical trials (RCT) only inform on 
      the average treatment effect in the studied population, and it is critical to 
      understand how treatment effect varies across subpopulations. In this paper we 
      describe a clustering-based approach for the assessment of Heterogeneity of 
      Treatment Effect (HTE) over patient phenotypes, which maintains the unsupervised 
      nature of classical subgroup analysis while jointly accounting for relevant 
      patient characteristics. METHODS: We applied phenotype-based stratification in 
      the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial, a non-inferiority trial comparing the effects of 
      higher-dose edoxaban regimen (direct anticoagulant) versus warfarin (vitamin K 
      antagonist) on a composite endpoint of stroke and systemic embolism in 14,062 
      patients with atrial fibrillation. RESULTS: We identified three distinct 
      phenotypes: non-white participants, mostly from Asia (A); white participants 
      without previous use of vitamin-K antagonists (B); and white participants with 
      previous use of vitamin-K antagonist (C). The effect of the higher-dose edoxaban 
      regimen vs warfarin significantly varied over phenotypes (p for 
      interaction = 0.03) with the strongest benefit in cluster A (HR = 0.72, 95 % CI: 
      0.52-1.00), moderate effect in cluster B (HR = 0.80, 95 % CI: 0.61, 1.06) and no 
      observed effect in cluster C (HR = 1.01, 95 % CI: 0.80, 1.27). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Assessing HTE over patients' phenotypes might represent a relevant complement to 
      other stratification approaches to elucidate results from subgroups analyses, 
      especially in those settings where an overwhelming superiority overall effect was 
      not observed. Cluster analysis allows a clear discrimination of patients with 
      direct interpretability of who are the patients that would most benefit from the 
      investigated strategy or treatment.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study focuses on the innovative application of Automated Machine 
      Learning (AutoML) technology in cardiovascular medicine to construct an 
      explainable Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) prediction model to support the 
      clinical diagnosis of CAD. METHODS: This study utilizes a combined data set of 
      five public data sets related to CAD. An ensemble model is constructed using the 
      AutoML open-source framework AutoGluon to evaluate the feasibility of AutoML in 
      constructing a disease prediction model in cardiovascular medicine. The 
      performance of the ensemble model is compared against individual baseline models. 
      Finally, the disease prediction ensemble model is explained using SHapley 
      Additive exPlanations (SHAP). RESULTS: The experimental results show that the 
      AutoGluon-based ensemble model performs better than the individual baseline 
      models in predicting CAD. It achieved an accuracy of 0.9167 and an AUC of 0.9562 
      in 4-fold cross-bagging. SHAP measures the importance of each feature to the 
      prediction of the model and explains the prediction results of the model. 
      CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the feasibility and efficacy of AutoML 
      technology in cardiovascular medicine and highlights its potential in disease 
      prediction. AutoML reduces the barriers to model building and significantly 
      improves prediction accuracy. Additionally, the integration of SHAP enhances 
      model transparency and explainability, which is critical to ensuring model 
      credibility and widespread adoption in cardiovascular medicine.

AB  - Predicting cancer patient disease progression is a key step towards personalized 
      medicine and secondary prevention. Risk stratification systems based on 
      clinico-pathological criteria aim to identify high-risk patients, but accurate 
      predictions remain challenging. Deep learning models present new opportunities 
      for patient risk prediction, yet their interpretability has been largely 
      unexplored. We developed a transformer-based approach for predicting progression 
      of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) patients based on diagnostic 
      histopathology tumor slides. Our initial model showed AUROC = 0.92 on a held-out 
      test set, with average AUROC of 0.65 on external validation cohorts. To further 
      increase generalizability and reduce potential privacy concerns, we trained the 
      model in a federated manner across three clinical centers, reaching AUROC = 0.82 
      across all cohorts, with image-based risk scores achieving hazard ratios up to 
      7.42 (p < 0.01) in multivariable analyses. Through interpretability analysis, we 
      identified spatial and morphological features predictive of progression, 
      suggesting that tumor boundary information and tissue heterogeneity characterize 
      progressive cSCCs. Trained exclusively on routine diagnostic slides and offering 
      biological insights, our model can improve secondary prevention and understanding 
      of cSCC while enabling deployment across clinical centers without administrative 
      overheads or privacy concerns.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Survival prediction is one of the crucial goals in precision 
      medicine, as accurate survival assessment can aid physicians in selecting 
      appropriate treatment for individual patients. To achieve this aim, extensive 
      data must be utilized to train the prediction model and prevent overfitting. 
      However, the collection of patient data for disease prediction is challenging due 
      to potential variations in data sources across institutions and concerns 
      regarding privacy and ownership issues in data sharing. To facilitate the 
      integration of cancer data from different institutions without violating privacy 
      laws, we developed a federated learning-based data integration framework called 
      AdFed, which can be used to evaluate patients' survival while considering the 
      privacy protection problem by utilizing the decentralized federated learning 
      technology and regularization method. RESULTS: AdFed was tested on different 
      cancer datasets that contain the patients' information from different 
      institutions. The experimental results show that AdFed using distributed data can 
      achieve better performance in cancer survival prediction (AUC = 0.605) than the 
      compared federated-learning-based methods (average AUC = 0.554). Additionally, to 
      assess the biological interpretability of our method, in the case study we list 
      10 identified genes related to liver cancer selected by AdFed, among which 5 
      genes have been proved by literature review. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate 
      that AdFed outperforms better than other federated-learning-based methods, and 
      the interpretable algorithm can select biologically significant genes and 
      pathways while ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of data.

AB  - Large language models, a cutting-edge technology in artificial intelligence, are 
      reshaping the new paradigm of chronic ocular diseases management. In this study, 
      we comprehensively examined the current status and trends in the application of 
      large language models in major blinding chronic ocular diseases such as glaucoma, 
      cataract, and diabetic retinopathy through a systematic scoping review approach. 
      We conducted this review based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
      Reviews and Meta-Analyses extended to characterize the application of large 
      language models in the field of chronic ocular diseases. The study reveals that 
      large language models demonstrate comparable efficacy to experts in disease 
      screening, diagnostic decision-making, personalized precision treatment 
      recommendation, and accessibility of healthcare resources by integrating 
      multimodal clinical data. However, the application of the technology still faces 
      a triple challenge: (1) the limitation of model generalization ability due to the 
      multimodal nature of clinical data; (2) the ethical controversy caused by the 
      insufficient interpretability of algorithms; and (3) the lack of a standardized 
      validation framework. Future directions emphasize the need for specialized model 
      training, multimodal algorithm optimization, the establishment of a multinational 
      multicenter clinical validation platform, and the construction of an ethical 
      framework for dynamic regulation. Large language models are expected to evolve 
      from an assisted decision-making tool to a core component of precision medicine 
      for chronic ocular diseases, and ultimately to achieve an ecosystem of 
      energy-efficient full-cycle management of chronic ocular diseases.

TI  - Development and Validation of DIANA (Diabetes Novel Subgroup Assessment tool): A 
      web-based precision medicine tool to determine type 2 diabetes endotype 
      membership and predict individuals at risk of microvascular disease.
PG  - e0000702
LID - 10.1371/journal.pdig.0000702 [doi]
LID - e0000702
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous research has identified four distinct endotypes of type 2 
      diabetes in Asian Indians, which include Severe Insulin Deficient Diabetes 
      (SIDD), Combined Insulin Resistant and Deficient Diabetes (CIRDD), Insulin 
      Resistance and Obese Diabetes (IROD), and Mild Age-related Diabetes (MARD). DIANA 
      (Diabetes Novel Subgroup Assessment) is an online precision medicine tool that 
      can predict endotype membership of type 2 diabetes and individual risk for 
      retinopathy and nephropathy. METHODOLOGY: The DIANA tool determines subgroup 
      membership using a machine learning model (support vector machine) on T2D 
      subgroups in the Asian Indian population. We used a support vector machine (SVM) 
      model to classify type 2 diabetes patient endotypes, and the model is trained 
      based on k-fold cross-validation. Its performance was compared with an algorithm 
      determined based on conditional pre-determined cut-offs and weights for each 
      clinical feature [age at diagnosis, BMI, waist, HbA1c, Serum Triglycerides, 
      HDL-Cholesterol, (C-peptide fasting, C-peptide stimulated) - optional. This study 
      employed local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) and SHapley 
      Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to demystify the endotype prediction model. A random 
      forest model was built to assess an individual's risk for nephropathy and 
      retinopathy based on individual risk algorithms. FINDINGS: The SVM model has 
      relatively high accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and precision values compared 
      to conditional pre-determined cut-offs 98% vs 63.6%, 99.8% vs 88%, 98.5% vs 
      65.1%, and 98.7% vs 63.4%. Clinician face value validation of the prediction by 
      the SVM model reported an accuracy, specificity, sensitivity and precision 
      compared to conditional pre-determined cut-offs 97% vs 85%, 95.3% vs 63%, 95.8% 
      vs 73%, and 98.9% vs 66.9%. Additionally, our study demonstrated the impact of 
      features on ML models through LIME and SHAP analyses. The accuracy of the random 
      forest risk prediction model for nephropathy and retinopathy was 89.6% (p < 0.05) 
      and 78.4% (p < 0.05), respectively. CONCLUSION: We conclude that, DIANA is an 
      accurate, clinically explainable AI tool that clinicians can use to make informed 
      decisions on risk assessment and provide precision management to individuals with 
      new-onset type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Combining unsupervised, supervised and rule-based learning: the case of detecting 
      patient allergies in electronic health records.
PG  - 188
LID - 10.1186/s12911-023-02271-8 [doi]
LID - 188
AB  - BACKGROUND: Data mining of electronic health records (EHRs) has a huge potential 
      for improving clinical decision support and to help healthcare deliver precision 
      medicine. Unfortunately, the rule-based and machine learning-based approaches 
      used for natural language processing (NLP) in healthcare today all struggle with 
      various shortcomings related to performance, efficiency, or transparency. 
      METHODS: In this paper, we address these issues by presenting a novel method for 
      NLP that implements unsupervised learning of word embeddings, semi-supervised 
      learning for simplified and accelerated clinical vocabulary and concept building, 
      and deterministic rules for fine-grained control of information extraction. The 
      clinical language is automatically learnt, and vocabulary, concepts, and rules 
      supporting a variety of NLP downstream tasks can further be built with only 
      minimal manual feature engineering and tagging required from clinical experts. 
      Together, these steps create an open processing pipeline that gradually refines 
      the data in a transparent way, which greatly improves the interpretable nature of 
      our method. Data transformations are thus made transparent and predictions 
      interpretable, which is imperative for healthcare. The combined method also has 
      other advantages, like potentially being language independent, demanding few 
      domain resources for maintenance, and able to cover misspellings, abbreviations, 
      and acronyms. To test and evaluate the combined method, we have developed a 
      clinical decision support system (CDSS) named Information System for Clinical 
      Concept Searching (ICCS) that implements the method for clinical concept tagging, 
      extraction, and classification. RESULTS: In empirical studies the method shows 
      high performance (recall 92.6%, precision 88.8%, F-measure 90.7%), and has 
      demonstrated its value to clinical practice. Here we employ a real-life 
      EHR-derived dataset to evaluate the method's performance on the task of 
      classification (i.e., detecting patient allergies) against a range of common 
      supervised learning algorithms. The combined method achieves state-of-the-art 
      performance compared to the alternative methods we evaluate. We also perform a 
      qualitative analysis of common word embedding methods on the task of word 
      similarity to examine their potential for supporting automatic feature 
      engineering for clinical NLP tasks. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the promising results, 
      we suggest more research should be aimed at exploiting the inherent synergies 
      between unsupervised, supervised, and rule-based paradigms for clinical NLP.

AB  - The Israeli Ministry of Health has set up the foundations of a National 
      Pharmacovigilance System. The next step is to adopt the best of the international 
      ideas, trends and approaches which are shaping the future of pharmacovigilance. 
      Specifically: 1) The risk management approach requires proactively preventing or 
      minimizing risks, starting in early clinical development and extending all along 
      the lifecycle of a pharmaceutical. 2) Drug safety is a multidisciplinary 
      discipline where all stakeholders should be involved. 3) Clinical trials provide 
      an ideal safety profile limited to the restrictive conditions of the trial. Only 
      real-world data, from the post marketing period, will reveal the real 
      risk/benefit balance for the use of a pharmaceutical in regular clinical care. 4) 
      Artificial intelligence is needed to analyze the large amount of data collected 
      through the post-marketing studies, electronic medical records and the internet. 
      Many AI tools have been developed to support better use of pharmaceuticals. 5) 
      Quality-oriented, thorough inspections and audits are critical for achieving 
      patient safety. 6) Patients should be recognized as active players in their 
      treatment who can, and should, have access to safety information through the 
      major agencies' websites.Israel can benefit from several of its key assets to 
      reach a higher level of pharmacovigilance: 1) Israel's four HMOs are organized in 
      a way that allows them to have quick and efficient dialogue with healthcare 
      professionals and with patients. Moreover, a new project named, Big Data in 
      Health, will pool the epidemiologic databases of the HMOs, providing precious 
      information for understanding risk factors, detecting alerts, and developing 
      personalized medicine. 2) Formal risk management activities have long been part 
      of the culture of hospitals and should be applied increasingly to ensuring drug 
      safety.Israel has the organizational, scientific, technological and cultural 
      resources needed to quickly overcome the challenges and go beyond its current 
      state to build a unique pharmacovigilance system which could serve as an example 
      for other countries.

TI  - ToxiPep: Peptide toxicity prediction via fusion of context-aware representation 
      and atomic-level graph.
PG  - 2347-2358

AB  - Peptide-based therapeutics have emerged as a promising avenue in drug 
      development, offering high biocompatibility, specificity, and efficacy. However, 
      the potential toxicity of peptides remains a significant challenge, necessitating 
      the development of robust toxicity prediction methods. In this study, we 
      introduce ToxiPep, a novel dual-model framework for peptide toxicity prediction 
      that integrates sequence-based contextual information with atomic-level 
      structural features. This framework combines BiGRU and Transformer to capture 
      local and global sequence dependencies while leveraging multi-scale CNNs to 
      extract refined structural features from molecular graphs derived from peptide 
      SMILES representations. A cross-attention mechanism aligns and fuses these two 
      feature modalities, enabling the model to capture intricate relationships between 
      sequence and structural information. ToxiPep outperforms several state-of-the-art 
      tools, including ToxinPred2, CSM-Toxin, PepNet, and ToxinPred3, on both internal 
      and independent test sets. Additionally, interpretability analyses reveal that 
      ToxiPep identifies key amino acids along with their structural features, 
      providing insights into the molecular mechanisms of peptide toxicity. To 
      facilitate broader accessibility, we have also developed a web server for 
      convenient user access. Overall, this framework has the potential to accelerate 
      the identification of safer therapeutic peptides, offering new opportunities for 
      peptide-based drug development in precision medicine.

TI  - A Multimodal Predictive Model for Chronic Kidney Disease and Its Association With 
      Vascular Complications in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes: Model Development and 
      Validation Study in South Korea and the U.K.
PG  - 1562-1570

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a multimodal model to predict chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
      in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), given the limited research on 
      this integrative approach. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We obtained multimodal 
      data sets from Kyung Hee University Medical Center (n = 7,028; discovery cohort) 
      for training and internal validation and UK Biobank (n = 1,544; validation 
      cohort) for external validation. CKD was defined based on ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes 
      and/or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≤60 mL/min/1.73 m2. We 
      ensembled various deep learning models and interpreted their predictions using 
      explainable artificial intelligence (AI) methods, including Shapley additive 
      explanation values (SHAP) and gradient-weighted class activation mapping 
      (Grad-CAM). Subsequently, we investigated the potential association between the 
      model probability and vascular complications. RESULTS: The multimodal model, 
      which ensembles visual geometry group 16 and deep neural network, presented high 
      performance in predicting CKD, with area under the receiver operating 
      characteristic curve of 0.880 (95% CI 0.806-0.954) in the discovery cohort and 
      0.722 in the validation cohort. SHAP and Grad-CAM highlighted key predictors, 
      including eGFR and optic disc, respectively. The model probability was associated 
      with an increased risk of macrovascular complications (tertile 1 [T1]: adjusted 
      hazard ratio, 1.42 [95% CI 1.06-1.90]; T2: 1.59 [1.17-2.16]; T3: 1.64 
      [1.20-2.26]) and microvascular complications (T3: 1.30 [1.02-1.67]). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our multimodal AI model integrates fundus images and clinical data from 
      binational cohorts to predict the risk of new-onset CKD within 5 years and 
      associated vascular complications in patients with T2DM.

TI  - SurvConvMixer: robust and interpretable cancer survival prediction based on 
      ConvMixer using pathway-level gene expression images.

AB  - Cancer is one of the leading causes of deaths worldwide. Survival analysis and 
      prediction of cancer patients is of great significance for their precision 
      medicine. The robustness and interpretability of the survival prediction models 
      are important, where robustness tells whether a model has learned the knowledge, 
      and interpretability means if a model can show human what it has learned. In this 
      paper, we propose a robust and interpretable model SurvConvMixer, which uses 
      pathways customized gene expression images and ConvMixer for cancer short-term, 
      mid-term and long-term overall survival prediction. With ConvMixer, the 
      representation of each pathway can be learned respectively. We show the 
      robustness of our model by testing the trained model on absolutely untrained 
      external datasets. The interpretability of SurvConvMixer depends on 
      gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-Cam), by which we can obtain the 
      pathway-level activation heat map. Then wilcoxon rank-sum tests are conducted to 
      obtain the statistically significant pathways, thereby revealing which pathways 
      the model focuses on more. SurvConvMixer achieves remarkable performance on the 
      short-term, mid-term and long-term overall survival of lung adenocarcinoma, lung 
      squamous cell carcinoma and skin cutaneous melanoma, and the external validation 
      tests show that SurvConvMixer can generalize to external datasets so that it is 
      robust. Finally, we investigate the activation maps generated by Grad-Cam, after 
      wilcoxon rank-sum test and Kaplan-Meier estimation, we find that some 
      survival-related pathways play important role in SurvConvMixer.

TI  - Towards Precision Medicine in Sinonasal Tumors: Low-Dimensional Radiomic 
      Signature Extraction from MRI.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics15131675 [doi]
LID - 1675
AB  - Background: Sinonasal tumors are rare, accounting for 3-5% of head and neck 
      neoplasms. Machine learning (ML) and radiomics have shown promise in tumor 
      classification, but current models lack detailed morphological and textural 
      characterization. Methods: This study analyzed MRI data from 145 patients (76 
      malignant and 69 benign) across multiple centers. Radiomic features were 
      extracted from T1-weighted (T1-w) images with contrast and T2-weighted (T2-w) 
      images based on manually annotated tumor volumes. A dedicated ML pipeline 
      assessed the effectiveness of different radiomic features and their integration 
      with clinical variables. The DNetPRO algorithm was used to extract signatures 
      combining radiomic and clinical data. Results: The results showed that ML 
      classification using both data types achieved a median Matthews Correlation 
      Coefficient (MCC) of 0.60 ± 0.07. The best-performing DNetPRO models reached an 
      MCC of 0.73 (T1-w + T2-w) and 0.61 (T1-w only). Key clinical features included 
      symptoms and tumor size, while radiomic features provided additional diagnostic 
      insights, particularly regarding gray-level distribution in T2-w and texture 
      complexity in T1-w images. Conclusions: Despite its potential, ML-based radiomics 
      faces challenges in clinical adoption due to data variability and model 
      diversity. Standardization and interpretability are crucial for reliability. The 
      DNetPRO approach helps explain feature importance and relationships, reinforcing 
      the clinical relevance of integrating radiomic and clinical data for sinonasal 
      tumor classification.

TI  - Learning the natural history of human disease with generative transformers.
LID - 10.1038/s41586-025-09529-3 [doi]
AB  - Decision-making in healthcare relies on understanding patients' past and current 
      health states to predict and, ultimately, change their future course(1-3). 
      Artificial intelligence (AI) methods promise to aid this task by learning 
      patterns of disease progression from large corpora of health records(4,5). 
      However, their potential has not been fully investigated at scale. Here we modify 
      the GPT(6) (generative pretrained transformer) architecture to model the 
      progression and competing nature of human diseases. We train this model, 
      Delphi-2M, on data from 0.4 million UK Biobank participants and validate it using 
      external data from 1.9 million Danish individuals with no change in parameters. 
      Delphi-2M predicts the rates of more than 1,000 diseases, conditional on each 
      individual's past disease history, with accuracy comparable to that of existing 
      single-disease models. Delphi-2M's generative nature also enables sampling of 
      synthetic future health trajectories, providing meaningful estimates of potential 
      disease burden for up to 20 years, and enabling the training of AI models that 
      have never seen actual data. Explainable AI methods(7) provide insights into 
      Delphi-2M's predictions, revealing clusters of co-morbidities within and across 
      disease chapters and their time-dependent consequences on future health, but also 
      highlight biases learnt from training data. In summary, transformer-based models 
      appear to be well suited for predictive and generative health-related tasks, are 
      applicable to population-scale datasets and provide insights into temporal 
      dependencies between disease events, potentially improving the understanding of 
      personalized health risks and informing precision medicine approaches.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Gliomas and brain metastases (Mets) are the most common brain 
      malignancies. The treatment strategy and clinical prognosis of patients are 
      different, requiring accurate diagnosis of tumor types. However, the traditional 
      radiomics diagnostic pipeline requires manual annotation and lacks integrated 
      methods for segmentation and classification. To improve the diagnosis process, a 
      gliomas and Mets computer-aided diagnosis method with automatic lesion 
      segmentation and ensemble decision strategy on multi-center datasets was 
      proposed. METHODS: Overall, 1,022 high-grade gliomas and 775 Mets patients' 
      preoperative MR images were adopted in the study, including contrast-enhanced 
      T1-weighted (T1-CE) and T2-fluid attenuated inversion recovery (T2-flair) 
      sequences from three hospitals. Two segmentation models trained on the gliomas 
      and Mets datasets, respectively, were used to automatically segment tumors. 
      Multiple radiomics features were extracted after automatic segmentation. Several 
      machine learning classifiers were used to measure the impact of feature selection 
      methods. A weight soft voting (RSV) model and ensemble decision strategy based on 
      prior knowledge (EDPK) were introduced in the radiomics pipeline. Accuracy, 
      sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating 
      characteristic curve (AUC) were used to evaluate the classification performance. 
      RESULTS: The proposed pipeline improved the diagnosis of gliomas and Mets with 
      ACC reaching 0.8950 and AUC reaching 0.9585 after automatic lesion segmentation, 
      which was higher than those of the traditional radiomics pipeline (ACC:0.8850, 
      AUC:0.9450). CONCLUSION: The proposed model accurately classified gliomas and 
      Mets patients using MRI radiomics. The novel pipeline showed great potential in 
      diagnosing gliomas and Mets with high generalizability and interpretability.

TI  - Association Between the Glucose-to-Lymphocyte Ratio and 28-Day Mortality in 
      Patients with Mechanical Ventilation.
PG  - 358-366
LID - 10.4274/balkanmedj.galenos.2025.2025-2-49 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The association between the glucose-to-lymphocyte ratio (GLR) and 
      adverse outcomes in intensive care unit patients receiving mechanical ventilation 
      (MV) has not been clearly established. AIMS: To examine the link between GLR and 
      28-day mortality in MV patients and to develop an interpretable machine learning 
      model to predict mortality risk. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study. METHODS: 
      Data were obtained from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
      (MIMIC-IV, version 3.1) database. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and 
      restricted cubic spline (RCS) curves were employed to assess the relationship 
      between GLR and mortality. Patients were categorized into high and low GLR groups 
      for Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Subgroup analyses were performed to evaluate 
      the association across different patient populations. Selected variables were 
      used to construct eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), support vector machine, 
      Naive Bayes, and k-nearest neighbors models. Model interpretability was assessed 
      using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values. RESULTS: A total of 5,738 
      patients met the inclusion criteria. RCS analysis indicated a nonlinear 
      relationship between GLR and 28-day mortality. Patients with elevated GLR had 
      significantly higher 28-day mortality rates (hazard ratio > 1, p < 0.05). Among 
      the models, XGBoost demonstrated the best performance, achieving an area under 
      the ROC curve of 0.969 and an F1-score of 0.963. SHAP analysis identified Acute 
      Physiology Score III, GLR, and lactate as the three most important predictors. 
      CONCLUSION: GLR is nonlinearly associated with 28-day mortality in patients 
      undergoing MV and may serve as a valuable prognostic marker. The interpretable 
      XGBoost model confirmed the significant association between GLR and short-term 
      mortality.

AB  - Deep learning (DL) can accelerate the prediction of prognostic biomarkers from 
      routine pathology slides in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, current approaches 
      rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and have mostly been validated on 
      small patient cohorts. Here, we develop a new transformer-based pipeline for 
      end-to-end biomarker prediction from pathology slides by combining a pre-trained 
      transformer encoder with a transformer network for patch aggregation. Our 
      transformer-based approach substantially improves the performance, 
      generalizability, data efficiency, and interpretability as compared with current 
      state-of-the-art algorithms. After training and evaluating on a large multicenter 
      cohort of over 13,000 patients from 16 colorectal cancer cohorts, we achieve a 
      sensitivity of 0.99 with a negative predictive value of over 0.99 for prediction 
      of microsatellite instability (MSI) on surgical resection specimens. We 
      demonstrate that resection specimen-only training reaches clinical-grade 
      performance on endoscopic biopsy tissue, solving a long-standing diagnostic 
      problem.

AB  - Fragmentation of healthcare systems through limited cross-speciality 
      communication and intermittent, intervention-based care, without insight into 
      follow-up and compliance, results in poor patient experiences and potentially 
      contributes to suboptimal outcomes. Data-driven tools and novel technologies have 
      the capability to address these shortcomings, but insights from all stakeholders 
      in the care continuum remain lacking. A structured online questionnaire was given 
      to respondents (n = 1432) in nine global geographies to investigate attitudes to 
      the use of data and novel technologies in the management of vascular disease. 
      Patients with coronary or peripheral artery disease (n = 961), physicians 
      responsible for their care (n = 345), and administrators/healthcare leaders with 
      responsibility for commissioning/procuring cardiovascular services (n = 126) were 
      included. Narrative themes arising from the survey included patients' desire for 
      more personalized healthcare, shared decision-making, and improved communication. 
      Patients, administrators, and physicians perceived and experienced deficiencies 
      in continuity of care, and all acknowledged the potential for data-driven 
      techniques and novel technologies to address some of these shortcomings. Further, 
      physicians and administrators saw the 'upstream' segment of the care 
      journey-before diagnosis, at point of diagnosis, and when determining 
      treatment-as key to enabling tangible improvements in patient experience and 
      outcomes. Finally, despite acceptance that data sharing is critical to the 
      success of such interventions, there remains persistent issues related to trust 
      and transparency. The current fragmented care continuum could be improved and 
      streamlined through the adoption of advanced data analytics and novel 
      technologies, including diagnostic and monitoring techniques. Such an approach 
      could enable the refocusing of healthcare from intermittent contacts and 
      intervention-only focus to a more holistic patient view.

      Subtypes and spatial heterogeneity in colon cancer.

AB  - Colon cancer (CC) is the third most prevalent cancer type. It is highly 
      heterogeneous, particularly in terms of molecular profiles, which have both 
      prognostic and predictive impacts on the treatment efficacy. However, CC 
      treatment in adjuvant situations is currently guided solely by T and N staging. 
      In this context, Consensus Molecular Subtypes (CMS) was introduced to stratify CC 
      patients based on molecular profiles. Recent studies have shown that CMS can be 
      heterogeneous in CC, leading to a worse prognosis. This study focuses on 
      predicting CMS and its heterogeneity in CC using deep learning on digitized 
      haematoxylin-eosin ± saffron-stained Whole Slide Images (WSIs). Data and WSI of 
      1,996 patients from the PETACC-8, TCGA-COAD, and PRODIGE-13 cohorts were used. 
      The model is trained to predict a 4-dimensional CMS vector, reflecting 
      intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH). It comprises a self-supervised model for 
      embedding image patches into vectors and a weakly-supervised model predicting CMS 
      calls. Ground-truth CMS scores are obtained with the CMSclassifier package. 
      Interpretability analyses are performed at the slide and patch levels. For 
      homogeneous tumors, the model trained on PETACC-8 achieves 93.0% (±1.4%) 
      macro-average AUC in internal cross-validation (CV) and 94.4% macro-average AUC 
      in external validation over PRODIGE-13, while the TCGA-COAD model reaches 85.4% 
      (±3.0%) in CV and 92.4% over PRODIGE-13. The trained models also provide spatial 
      distributions of CMS across tumor slides and associate specific histological 
      features to each CMS. Finally, the models are able to predict ITH. The results 
      show that a deep learning model trained on routine histology slides is capable of 
      providing an efficient and robust method for predicting CMS and characterizing a 
      patient's ITH, paving the way for the routine consideration of CMS/ITH in 
      clinical decision-making in the adjuvant setting.

TI  - Causal inference in the diagnosis and prognosis of ovarian cancer: current state 
      and future directions.
LID - 10.1007/s12094-025-03967-1 [doi]
AB  - Ovarian cancer represents one of the most lethal gynecologic malignancies, 
      characterized by low early detection rates and challenging prognostic assessment. 
      Conventional diagnostic modalities demonstrate limited sensitivity and 
      specificity for early-stage disease identification. Recent research has begun to 
      explore causal inference methodologies as complementary approaches that may 
      enhance diagnostic precision and prognostic capability. This systematic review 
      evaluates the current state and future prospects of causal inference 
      methodologies in enhancing ovarian cancer diagnosis and prognosis. We performed a 
      comprehensive systematic review focusing on causal inference methodologies 
      applied to ovarian cancer research. The analysis encompassed biomarker 
      identification, pathogenic mechanism elucidation, and multimodal data 
      integration. Additionally, we analyzed the synergistic combination of causal 
      inference with machine learning approaches across genomic, transcriptomic, 
      proteomic, and imaging datasets. Causal inference methods have shown 
      effectiveness in identifying crucial biomarkers and revealing underlying 
      pathogenic mechanisms of ovarian cancer. The integration of machine learning with 
      causal inference has enhanced model interpretability, clinical applicability, and 
      diagnostic-prognostic accuracy. These approaches have achieved improved 
      predictions of disease progression and optimization of treatment strategies by 
      leveraging clinical, genetic, and imaging data. Causal inference shows 
      considerable potential in advancing precision medicine for ovarian cancer, 
      offering robust frameworks for addressing confounding factors and establishing 
      causal relationships. As these methodologies evolve and data volumes expand, 
      their application may become increasingly valuable in oncology practice.

LID - e0281618
AB  - Within the framework of precision medicine, the stratification of individual 
      genetic susceptibility based on inherited DNA variation has paramount relevance. 
      However, one of the most relevant pitfalls of traditional Polygenic Risk Scores 
      (PRS) approaches is their inability to model complex high-order non-linear 
      SNP-SNP interactions and their effect on the phenotype (e.g. epistasis). Indeed, 
      they incur in a computational challenge as the number of possible interactions 
      grows exponentially with the number of SNPs considered, affecting the statistical 
      reliability of the model parameters as well. In this work, we address this issue 
      by proposing a novel PRS approach, called High-order Interactions-aware Polygenic 
      Risk Score (hiPRS), that incorporates high-order interactions in modeling 
      polygenic risk. The latter combines an interaction search routine based on 
      frequent itemsets mining and a novel interaction selection algorithm based on 
      Mutual Information, to construct a simple and interpretable weighted model of 
      user-specified dimensionality that can predict a given binary phenotype. Compared 
      to traditional PRSs methods, hiPRS does not rely on GWAS summary statistics nor 
      any external information. Moreover, hiPRS differs from Machine Learning-based 
      approaches that can include complex interactions in that it provides a readable 
      and interpretable model and it is able to control overfitting, even on small 
      samples. In the present work we demonstrate through a comprehensive simulation 
      study the superior performance of hiPRS w.r.t. state of the art methods, both in 
      terms of scoring performance and interpretability of the resulting model. We also 
      test hiPRS against small sample size, class imbalance and the presence of noise, 
      showcasing its robustness to extreme experimental settings. Finally, we apply 
      hiPRS to a case study on real data from DACHS cohort, defining an 
      interaction-aware scoring model to predict mortality of stage II-III Colon-Rectal 
      Cancer patients treated with oxaliplatin.

PG  - 2101-2115
LID - 10.1007/s00417-025-06831-8 [doi]
AB  - Retinal oximetry, which refers to the measurement of the oxygen saturation of 
      haemoglobin in retinal blood, has emerged as a promising tool for understanding 
      ocular and systemic diseases over the past few decades. Advances in traditional 
      dual-wavelength measurement techniques, as well as their integration with more 
      advanced technologies, have driven significant progress in the field. Researchers 
      have utilised commercially available devices to explore the applications of 
      retinal oximetry in both healthy individuals and various disease states. To 
      provide a comprehensive overview of the current status and development trends of 
      retinal oximetry in ophthalmology, this review analyses relevant studies on 
      retinal oximetry, including its principles, techniques, instrumentation, and 
      applications in healthy individuals, ocular diseases, and systemic disorders. As 
      a biomarker, retinal oximetry provides reliable insights into the retinal and 
      systemic microcirculation in a noninvasive, rapid, and convenient manner. It has 
      demonstrated potential value in the measurement of standardised data and in 
      contributing to the understanding of disease mechanisms. However, its measurement 
      accuracy is influenced by factors such as vessel diameter, retinal pigmentation, 
      and optical media transparency. Future advancements, including wide-field imaging 
      technology, nonmydriatic technology, integration with blood flow measurement 
      techniques, and artificial intelligence, are expected to further improve the 
      accuracy and clinical application potential of retinal oximetry.

AB  - Objective: To develop a clinical decision support tool that can predict 
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk with high accuracy while requiring minimal 
      clinical feature input, thus reducing the time and effort required by clinicians 
      to manually enter data prior to obtaining patient risk assessment. Results: In 
      this study, we propose a robust feature selection approach that identifies five 
      key features strongly associated with CVD risk, which have been found to be 
      consistent across various models. The machine learning model developed using this 
      optimized feature set achieved state-of-the-art results, with an AUROC of 91.30%, 
      sensitivity of 89.01%, and specificity of 85.39%. Furthermore, the insights 
      obtained from explainable artificial intelligence techniques enable medical 
      practitioners to offer personalized interventions by prioritizing 
      patient-specific high-risk factors. Conclusion: Our work illustrates a robust 
      approach to patient risk prediction which minimizes clinical feature requirements 
      while also generating patient-specific insights to facilitate shared 
      decision-making between clinicians and patients.

TI  - Combined kinome inhibition states are predictive of cancer cell line sensitivity 
      to kinase inhibitor combination therapies.

AB  - Protein kinases are a primary focus in targeted therapy development for cancer, 
      owing to their role as regulators in nearly all areas of cell life. Kinase 
      inhibitors are one of the fastest growing drug classes in oncology, but 
      resistance acquisition to kinase-targeting monotherapies is inevitable due to the 
      dynamic and interconnected nature of the kinome in response to perturbation. 
      Recent strategies targeting the kinome with combination therapies have shown 
      promise, such as the approval of Trametinib and Dabrafenib in advanced melanoma, 
      but similar empirical combination design for less characterized pathways remains 
      a challenge. Computational combination screening is an attractive alternative, 
      allowing in-silico screening prior to in-vitro or in-vivo testing of drastically 
      fewer leads, increasing efficiency and effectiveness of drug development 
      pipelines. In this work, we generate combined kinome inhibition states of 40,000 
      kinase inhibitor combinations from kinobeads-based kinome profiling across 64 
      doses. We then integrated these with baseline transcriptomics from CCLE to build 
      robust machine learning models to predict cell line sensitivity from NCI-ALMANAC 
      across nine cancer types, with model accuracy R(2) ~ 0.75-0.9 after feature 
      selection using elastic-net regression. We further validated the model's ability 
      to extend to real-world examples by using the best-performing breast cancer model 
      to generate predictions for kinase inhibitor combination sensitivity and synergy 
      in a PDX-derived TNBC cell line and saw reasonable global accuracy in our 
      experimental validation (R(2) ~ 0.7) as well as high accuracy in predicting 
      synergy using four popular metrics (R(2) ~ 0.9). Additionally, the model was able 
      to predict a highly synergistic combination of Trametinib (MEK inhibitor) and 
      Omipalisib (PI3K inhibitor) for TNBC treatment, which incidentally was recently 
      in phase I clinical trials for TNBC. Our choice of tree-based models over 
      networks for greater interpretability also allowed us to further interrogate 
      which specific kinases were highly predictive of cell sensitivity in each cancer 
      type, and we saw confirmatory strong predictive power in the inhibition of MAPK, 
      CDK, and STK kinases. Overall, these results suggest that kinome inhibition 
      states of kinase inhibitor combinations are strongly predictive of cell line 
      responses and have great potential for integration into computational drug 
      screening pipelines. This approach may facilitate the identification of effective 
      kinase inhibitor combinations and accelerate the development of novel cancer 
      therapies, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

AB  - Pathologic myopia is a leading cause of visual impairment and blindness. While 
      deep learning-based approaches aid in recognizing pathologic myopia using color 
      fundus photography, they often rely on implicit patterns that lack clinical 
      interpretability. This study aims to diagnose pathologic myopia by identifying 
      clinically significant morphologic patterns, specifically posterior staphyloma 
      and myopic maculopathy, by leveraging ultra-widefield (UWF) images that provide a 
      broad retinal field of view. We curate a large-scale, multi-source UWF myopia 
      dataset called PSMM and introduce RealMNet, an end-to-end lightweight framework 
      designed to identify these challenging patterns. Benefiting from the fast 
      pretraining distillation backbone, RealMNet comprises only 21 million parameters, 
      which facilitates deployment for medical devices. Extensive experiments conducted 
      across three different protocols demonstrate the robustness and generalizability 
      of RealMNet. RealMNet achieves an F1 Score of 0.7970 (95% CI 0.7612-0.8328), mAP 
      of 0.8497 (95% CI 0.8058-0.8937), and AUROC of 0.9745 (95% CI 0.9690-0.9801), 
      showcasing promise in clinical applications.

AB  - Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) are expected to play a critical role in precision 
      medicine. Currently, PRS predictors are generally based on linear models using 
      summary statistics, and more recently individual-level data. However, these 
      predictors mainly capture additive relationships and are limited in data 
      modalities they can use. We developed a deep learning framework (EIR) for PRS 
      prediction which includes a model, genome-local-net (GLN), specifically designed 
      for large-scale genomics data. The framework supports multi-task learning, 
      automatic integration of other clinical and biochemical data, and model 
      explainability. When applied to individual-level data from the UK Biobank, the 
      GLN model demonstrated a competitive performance compared to established neural 
      network architectures, particularly for certain traits, showcasing its potential 
      in modeling complex genetic relationships. Furthermore, the GLN model 
      outperformed linear PRS methods for Type 1 Diabetes, likely due to modeling 
      non-additive genetic effects and epistasis. This was supported by our 
      identification of widespread non-additive genetic effects and epistasis in the 
      context of T1D. Finally, we constructed PRS models that integrated genotype, 
      blood, urine, and anthropometric data and found that this improved performance 
      for 93% of the 290 diseases and disorders considered. EIR is available at 
      https://github.com/arnor-sigurdsson/EIR.

TI  - Developing Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence Models to Predict Vascular Disease 
      Progression: the VASCUL-AID-RETRO Study Protocol.
PG  - 15266028251313963
LID - 10.1177/15266028251313963 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) and peripheral artery disease 
      (PAD) are two vascular diseases with a significant risk of major adverse 
      cardiovascular events and mortality. A challenge in current disease management is 
      the unpredictable disease progression in individual patients. The 
      VASCUL-AID-RETRO study aims to develop trustworthy multimodal predictive 
      artificial intelligence (AI) models for multiple tasks including risk 
      stratification of disease progression and cardiovascular events in patients with 
      AAA and PAD. METHODS: The VASCUL-AID-RETRO study will collect data from 5000 AAA 
      and 6000 PAD patients across multiple European centers of the VASCUL-AID 
      consortium using electronic health records from 2015 to 2024. This 
      retrospectively-collected data will be enriched with additional data from 
      existing biobanks and registries. Multimodal data, including clinical records, 
      radiological imaging, proteomics, and genomics, will be collected to develop AI 
      models predicting disease progression and cardiovascular risks. This will be done 
      while integrating the international ethics guidelines and legal standards for 
      trustworthy AI, to ensure a socially-responsible data integration and analysis. 
      PROPOSED ANALYSES: A consensus-based variable list of clinical parameters and 
      core outcome set for both diseases will be developed through meetings with key 
      opinion leaders. Blood, plasma, and tissue samples from existing biobanks will be 
      analyzed for proteomic and genomic variations. AI models will be trained on 
      segmented AAA and PAD artery geometries for estimation of hemodynamic parameters 
      to quantify disease progression. Initially, risk prediction models will be 
      developed for each modality separately, and subsequently, all data will be 
      combined to be used as input to multimodal prediction models. During all 
      processes, data security, data quality, and ethical guidelines and legal 
      standards will be carefully considered. As a next step, the developed models will 
      be further adjusted with prospective data and internally validated in a 
      prospective cohort (VASCUL-AID-PRO study). CONCLUSION: The VASCUL-AID-RETRO study 
      will utilize advanced AI techniques and integrate clinical, imaging, and 
      multi-omics data to predict AAA and PAD progression and cardiovascular events. 
      CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: The VASCUL-AID-RETRO study is registered at 
      www.clinicaltrials.gov under the identification number NCT06206369. CLINICAL 
      IMPACT: The VASCUL-AID-RETRO study aims to improve clinical practice of vascular 
      surgery by developing artificial intelligence-driven multimodal predictive models 
      for patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms or peripheral artery disease, 
      enhancing personalized medicine. By integrating comprehensive data sets including 
      clinical, imaging, and multi-omics data, these models have the potential to 
      provide accurate risk stratification for disease progression and cardiovascular 
      events. An innovation lies in the extensive European data set in combination with 
      multimodal analyses approaches, which enables the development of advanced models 
      to facilitate better understanding of disease mechanisms and progression. For 
      clinicians, this means that more precise, individualized treatment plans can be 
      established, ultimately aiming to improve patient outcomes.

TI  - RDAG U-Net: An Advanced AI Model for Efficient and Accurate CT Scan Analysis of 
      SARS-CoV-2 Pneumonia Lesions.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics14182099 [doi]
LID - 2099
AB  - Background/Objective: This study aims to utilize advanced artificial intelligence 
      (AI) image recog-nition technologies to establish a robust system for identifying 
      features in lung computed tomog-raphy (CT) scans, thereby detecting respiratory 
      infections such as SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Spe-cifically, the research focuses on 
      developing a new model called Residual-Dense-Attention Gates U-Net (RDAG U-Net) 
      to improve accuracy and efficiency in identification. Methods: This study 
      employed Attention U-Net, Attention Res U-Net, and the newly developed RDAG U-Net 
      model. RDAG U-Net extends the U-Net architecture by incorporating ResBlock and 
      DenseBlock modules in the encoder to retain training parameters and reduce 
      computation time. The training dataset in-cludes 3,520 CT scans from an open 
      database, augmented to 10,560 samples through data en-hancement techniques. The 
      research also focused on optimizing convolutional architectures, image 
      preprocessing, interpolation methods, data management, and extensive fine-tuning 
      of training parameters and neural network modules. Result: The RDAG U-Net model 
      achieved an outstanding accuracy of 93.29% in identifying pulmonary lesions, with 
      a 45% reduction in computation time compared to other models. The study 
      demonstrated that RDAG U-Net performed stably during training and exhibited good 
      generalization capability by evaluating loss values, model-predicted lesion 
      annotations, and validation-epoch curves. Furthermore, using ITK-Snap to convert 
      2D pre-dictions into 3D lung and lesion segmentation models, the results 
      delineated lesion contours, en-hancing interpretability. Conclusion: The RDAG 
      U-Net model showed significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency in the 
      analysis of CT images for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, achieving a 93.29% recognition 
      accuracy and reducing computation time by 45% compared to other models. These 
      results indicate the potential of the RDAG U-Net model in clinical applications, 
      as it can accelerate the detection of pulmonary lesions and effectively enhance 
      diagnostic accuracy. Additionally, the 2D and 3D visualization results allow 
      physicians to understand lesions' morphology and distribution better, 
      strengthening decision support capabilities and providing valuable medical 
      diagnosis and treatment planning tools.

AB  - Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is a valuable modality in the diagnosis 
      and characterization of cardiovascular diseases, since it can identify 
      abnormalities in structure and function of the myocardium non-invasively and 
      without the need for ionizing radiation. However, in clinical practice, it is 
      commonly acquired as a collection of separated and independent 2D image planes, 
      which limits its accuracy in 3D analysis. This paper presents a completely 
      automated pipeline for generating patient-specific 3D biventricular heart models 
      from cine magnetic resonance (MR) slices. Our pipeline automatically selects the 
      relevant cine MR images, segments them using a deep learning-based method to 
      extract the heart contours, and aligns the contours in 3D space correcting 
      possible misalignments due to breathing or subject motion first using the 
      intensity and contours information from the cine data and next with the help of a 
      statistical shape model. Finally, the sparse 3D representation of the contours is 
      used to generate a smooth 3D biventricular mesh. The computational pipeline is 
      applied and evaluated in a CMR dataset of 20 healthy subjects. Our results show 
      an average reduction of misalignment artefacts from 1.82 ± 1.60 mm to 
      0.72 ± 0.73 mm over 20 subjects, in terms of distance from the final 
      reconstructed mesh. The high-resolution 3D biventricular meshes obtained with our 
      computational pipeline are used for simulations of electrical activation 
      patterns, showing agreement with non-invasive electrocardiographic imaging. The 
      automatic methodologies presented here for patient-specific MR imaging-based 3D 
      biventricular representations contribute to the efficient realization of 
      precision medicine, enabling the enhanced interpretability of clinical data, the 
      digital twin vision through patient-specific image-based modelling and 
      simulation, and augmented reality applications. This article is part of the theme 
      issue 'Advanced computation in cardiovascular physiology: new challenges and 
      opportunities'.

TI  - Discovering Distinct Phenotypical Clusters in Heart Failure Across the Ejection 
      Fraction Spectrum: a Systematic Review.
PG  - 333-349
LID - 10.1007/s11897-023-00615-z [doi]
AB  - REVIEW PURPOSE: This systematic review aims to summarise clustering studies in 
      heart failure (HF) and guide future clinical trial design and implementation in 
      routine clinical practice. FINDINGS: 34 studies were identified (n = 19 in HF 
      with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)). There was significant heterogeneity 
      invariables and techniques used. However, 149/165 described clusters could be 
      assigned to one of nine phenotypes: 1) young, low comorbidity burden; 2) 
      metabolic; 3) cardio-renal; 4) atrial fibrillation (AF); 5) elderly female AF; 6) 
      hypertensive-comorbidity; 7) ischaemic-male; 8) valvular disease; and 9) devices. 
      There was room for improvement on important methodological topics for all 
      clustering studies such as external validation and transparency of the modelling 
      process. The large overlap between the phenotypes of the clustering studies shows 
      that clustering is a robust approach for discovering clinically distinct 
      phenotypes. However, future studies should invest in a phenotype model that can 
      be implemented in routine clinical practice and future clinical trial design.

TI  - An Innovative Multi-Omics Model Integrating Latent Alignment and Attention 
      Mechanism for Drug Response Prediction.
LID - 10.3390/jpm14070694 [doi]
LID - 694
AB  - By using omics, we can now examine all components of biological systems 
      simultaneously. Deep learning-based drug prediction methods have shown promise by 
      integrating cancer-related multi-omics data. However, the complex interaction 
      between genes poses challenges in accurately projecting multi-omics data. In this 
      research, we present a predictive model for drug response that incorporates 
      diverse types of omics data, comprising genetic mutation, copy number variation, 
      methylation, and gene expression data. This study proposes latent alignment for 
      information mismatch in integration, which is achieved through an attention 
      module capturing interactions among diverse types of omics data. The latent 
      alignment and attention modules significantly improve predictions, outperforming 
      the baseline model, with MSE = 1.1333, F1-score = 0.5342, and AUROC = 0.5776. 
      High accuracy was achieved in predicting drug responses for piplartine and 
      tenovin-6, while the accuracy was comparatively lower for mitomycin-C and 
      obatoclax. The latent alignment module exclusively outperforms the baseline 
      model, enhancing the MSE by 0.2375, the F1-score by 4.84%, and the AUROC by 6.1%. 
      Similarly, the attention module only improves these metrics by 0.1899, 2.88%, and 
      2.84%, respectively. In the interpretability case study, panobinostat exhibited 
      the most effective predicted response, with a value of -4.895. We provide 
      reliable insights for drug selection in personalized medicine by identifying 
      crucial genetic factors influencing drug response.

TI  - Predicting ICU Delirium in Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients Using Demographic, 
      Clinical, and Laboratory Admission Data: A Machine Learning Approach.
LID - 10.3390/life15071045 [doi]
LID - 1045
AB  - Delirium is a common and underrecognized complication among critically ill 
      patients, associated with prolonged ICU stays, cognitive dysfunction, and 
      increased mortality. Its multifactorial causes and fluctuating course hinder 
      early prediction, limiting timely management. Predictive models based on data 
      available at ICU admission may help to identify high-risk patients and guide 
      early interventions. This study evaluated machine learning models used to predict 
      delirium in critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections using a 
      prospective cohort of 426 patients. The dataset included demographic 
      characteristics, clinical data (e.g., comorbidities, medication, reason for ICU 
      admission, interventions), and routine lab test results. Five models-Logistic 
      Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Naïve 
      Bayes-were developed using 112 features. Feature selection relied on Information 
      Gain, and model performance was assessed via 10-fold cross-validation. The Naïve 
      Bayes model showed moderate predictive performance and high interpretability, 
      achieving an AUC of 0.717, accuracy of 65.3%, sensitivity of 62.4%, specificity 
      of 68.1%, and precision of 66.2%. Key predictors included invasive mechanical 
      ventilation, deep sedation with benzodiazepines, SARS-CoV-2 as the reason for ICU 
      admission, ECMO use, constipation, and male sex. These findings support the use 
      of interpretable models for early delirium risk stratification using routinely 
      available ICU data.

AB  - Due to tumor heterogeneity, a subset of patients fails to benefit from current 
      treatment strategies. However, an integrated analysis of imaging features, 
      genetic molecules, and clinical phenotypes can characterize tumor heterogeneity, 
      enabling the development of more personalized treatment approaches. Despite its 
      potential, cross-modal databases remain underexplored. To address this gap, we 
      established a comprehensive database encompassing 9965 genes, 5449 proteins, 1121 
      metabolites, 283 pathways, 854 imaging features, and 73 clinical factors from 
      colorectal cancer patients. This database identifies significantly distinct 
      molecules and imaging features associated with clinical phenotypes and provides 
      survival analysis based on these features. Additionally, it offers genetic 
      molecule annotations, comparative expression levels between tumor and normal 
      tissues, imaging features linked to genetic molecules, and imaging-based models 
      for predicting gene expression levels. Furthermore, the database highlights 
      correlations between genetic molecules, clinical factors, and imaging features. 
      In summary, we present MIPD (Molecules, Imaging, and Clinical Phenotype 
      Correlation Database), a user-friendly, interactive, and specialized platform 
      accessible at http://corgenerf.com. MIPD facilitates the interpretability of 
      cross-modal data by providing query, browse, search, visualization, and download 
      functionalities, thereby offering a valuable resource for advancing precision 
      medicine in colorectal cancer. Database URL: http://corgenerf.

TI  - Deep Multi-Modal Skin-Imaging-Based Information-Switching Network for Skin Lesion 
      Recognition.
LID - 10.3390/bioengineering12030282 [doi]
LID - 282
AB  - The rising prevalence of skin lesions places a heavy burden on global health 
      resources and necessitates an early and precise diagnosis for successful 
      treatment. The diagnostic potential of recent multi-modal skin lesion detection 
      algorithms is limited because they ignore dynamic interactions and information 
      sharing across modalities at various feature scales. To address this, we propose 
      a deep learning framework, Multi-Modal Skin-Imaging-based Information-Switching 
      Network (MDSIS-Net), for end-to-end skin lesion recognition. MDSIS-Net extracts 
      intra-modality features using transfer learning in a multi-scale fully shared 
      convolutional neural network and introduces an innovative information-switching 
      module. A cross-attention mechanism dynamically calibrates and integrates 
      features across modalities to improve inter-modality associations and feature 
      representation in this module. MDSIS-Net is tested on clinical disfiguring 
      dermatosis data and the public Derm7pt melanoma dataset. A Visually Intelligent 
      System for Image Analysis (VISIA) captures five modalities: spots, red marks, 
      ultraviolet (UV) spots, porphyrins, and brown spots for disfiguring dermatosis. 
      The model performs better than existing approaches with an mAP of 0.967, accuracy 
      of 0.960, precision of 0.935, recall of 0.960, and f1-score of 0.947. Using 
      clinical and dermoscopic pictures from the Derm7pt dataset, MDSIS-Net outperforms 
      current benchmarks for melanoma, with an mAP of 0.877, accuracy of 0.907, 
      precision of 0.911, recall of 0.815, and f1-score of 0.851. The model's 
      interpretability is proven by Grad-CAM heatmaps correlating with clinical 
      diagnostic focus areas. In conclusion, our deep multi-modal information-switching 
      model enhances skin lesion identification by capturing relationship features and 
      fine-grained details across multi-modal images, improving both accuracy and 
      interpretability. This work advances clinical decision making and lays a 
      foundation for future developments in skin lesion diagnosis and treatment.

PG  - 666-675
LID - 10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-221763 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Osteoarthritis (OA) patient stratification is an important challenge 
      to design tailored treatments and drive drug development. Biochemical markers 
      reflecting joint tissue turnover were measured in the IMI-APPROACH cohort at 
      baseline and analysed using a machine learning approach in order to study 
      OA-dominant phenotypes driven by the endotype-related clusters and discover the 
      driving features and their disease-context meaning. METHOD: Data quality 
      assessment was performed to design appropriate data preprocessing techniques. The 
      k-means clustering algorithm was used to find dominant subgroups of patients 
      based on the biochemical markers data. Classification models were trained to 
      predict cluster membership, and Explainable AI techniques were used to interpret 
      these to reveal the driving factors behind each cluster and identify phenotypes. 
      Statistical analysis was performed to compare differences between clusters with 
      respect to other markers in the IMI-APPROACH cohort and the longitudinal disease 
      progression. RESULTS: Three dominant endotypes were found, associated with three 
      phenotypes: C1) low tissue turnover (low repair and articular 
      cartilage/subchondral bone turnover), C2) structural damage (high bone 
      formation/resorption, cartilage degradation) and C3) systemic inflammation (joint 
      tissue degradation, inflammation, cartilage degradation). The method achieved 
      consistent results in the FNIH/OAI cohort. C1 had the highest proportion of 
      non-progressors. C2 was mostly linked to longitudinal structural progression, and 
      C3 was linked to sustained or progressive pain. CONCLUSIONS: This work supports 
      the existence of differential phenotypes in OA. The biomarker approach could 
      potentially drive stratification for OA clinical trials and contribute to 
      precision medicine strategies for OA progression in the future. TRIAL

AB  - Chronic liver disease is a cluster of disorders associated with complex 
      haemodynamic alterations, which is characterised by structural and functional 
      disruptions of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic vasculature. 'Vasomics' is an 
      emerging omics discipline that comprehensively analyses and models the vascular 
      system by integrating pathophysiology of disease, biomechanics, medical imaging, 
      computational science and artificial intelligence. Vasomics is further typified 
      by its multidimensional, multiscale and high-throughput nature, which depends on 
      the rapid and robust extraction of well-defined vascular phenotypes with clear 
      clinical and/or biological interpretability. By leveraging multimodality medical 
      imaging techniques, vascular functional assessments, pathological image 
      evaluation, and related computational methods, integrated vasomics provides a 
      deeper understanding of the associations between the vascular system and disease. 
      This in turn reveals the crucial role of the vascular system in disease 
      occurrence, progression and treatment responses, thereby supporting precision 
      medicine approaches. Pathological vascular features have already demonstrated 
      their key role in different clinical scenarios. Despite this, vasomics is yet to 
      be widely recognised. Therefore, we furnished a comprehensive definition of 
      vasomics providing a classification of existing hepatic vascular phenotypes into 
      the following categories: anatomical, biomechanical, biochemical, 
      pathophysiological and composite.

AB  - The identification and understanding of gene-environment interactions can provide 
      insights into the pathways and mechanisms underlying complex diseases. However, 
      testing for gene-environment interaction remains a challenge since a.) 
      statistical power is often limited and b.) modeling of environmental effects is 
      nontrivial and such model misspecifications can lead to false positive 
      interaction findings. To address the lack of statistical power, recent methods 
      aim to identify interactions on an aggregated level using, for example, polygenic 
      risk scores. While this strategy can increase the power to detect interactions, 
      identifying contributing genes and pathways is difficult based on these 
      relatively global results. Here, we propose RITSS (Robust Interaction Testing 
      using Sample Splitting), a gene-environment interaction testing framework for 
      quantitative traits that is based on sample splitting and robust test statistics. 
      RITSS can incorporate sets of genetic variants and/or multiple environmental 
      factors. Based on the user's choice of statistical/machine learning approaches, a 
      screening step selects and combines potential interactions into scores with 
      improved interpretability. In the testing step, the application of robust 
      statistics minimizes the susceptibility to main effect misspecifications. Using 
      extensive simulation studies, we demonstrate that RITSS controls the type 1 error 
      rate in a wide range of scenarios, and we show how the screening strategy 
      influences statistical power. In an application to lung function phenotypes and 
      human height in the UK Biobank, RITSS identified highly significant interactions 
      based on subcomponents of genetic risk scores. While the contributing single 
      variant interaction signals are weak, our results indicate interaction patterns 
      that result in strong aggregated effects, providing potential insights into 
      underlying gene-environment interaction mechanisms.

TI  - An Interpretable Radiomics Model Based on Two-Dimensional Shear Wave Elastography 
      for Predicting Symptomatic Post-Hepatectomy Liver Failure in Patients with 
      Hepatocellular Carcinoma.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop and validate an interpretable 
      radiomics model based on two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE) for 
      symptomatic post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) prediction in patients 
      undergoing liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: A total 
      of 345 consecutive patients were enrolled. A five-fold cross-validation was 
      performed during training, and the models were evaluated in the independent test 
      cohort. A multi-patch radiomics model was established based on the 2D-SWE images 
      for predicting symptomatic PHLF. Clinical features were incorporated into the 
      models to train the clinical-radiomics model. The radiomics model and the 
      clinical-radiomics model were compared with the clinical model comprising 
      clinical variables and other clinical predictive indices, including the model for 
      end-stage liver disease (MELD) score and albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score. Shapley 
      Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was used for post hoc interpretability of the 
      radiomics model. RESULTS: The clinical-radiomics model achieved an AUC of 0.867 
      (95% CI 0.787-0.947) in the five-fold cross-validation, and this score was higher 
      than that of the clinical model (AUC: 0.809; 95% CI: 0.715-0.902) and the 
      radiomics model (AUC: 0.746; 95% CI: 0.681-0.811). The clinical-radiomics model 
      showed an AUC of 0.822 in the test cohort, higher than that of the clinical model 
      (AUC: 0.684, p = 0.007), radiomics model (AUC: 0.784, p = 0.415), MELD score 
      (AUC: 0.529, p < 0.001), and ALBI score (AUC: 0.644, p = 0.016). The SHAP 
      analysis showed that the first-order radiomics features, including first-order 
      maximum 64 × 64, first-order 90th percentile 64 × 64, and first-order 10th 
      percentile 32 × 32, were the most important features for PHLF prediction. 
      CONCLUSION: An interpretable clinical-radiomics model based on 2D-SWE and 
      clinical variables can help in predicting symptomatic PHLF in HCC.
