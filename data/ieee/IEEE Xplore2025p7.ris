AB  - Accurate predictive reasoning is a cornerstone of biomedical decision-making, particularly in precision oncology, where elucidating the intricate relationships between disease-risk genes and biological processes is critical. This study presents a novel "Thought Graph" methodology, an advancement of the Tree of Thoughts framework, to systematically generate and refine biological process representations derived from gene sets while addressing the trade-off between specificity and uncertainty. Balancing these factors is essential for robust and interpretable gene set analyses, as it accounts for the complexity, variability, and overlapping functions of biological pathways. Furthermore, we introduce a quantitative metric that integrates specificity and uncertainty, thereby enhancing the rigor and transparency of the inference process. Using a subset of the Gene Ontology database, we evaluate the effectiveness of our system in generating biologically meaningful terms that accurately describe the underlying biological processes of gene sets. We compare its performance against a domain-specific tool (GSEA) and five LLM baselines across multiple metrics. Our system achieves the highest cosine similarity (64.00%) and specificity percentile (96.40%), highlighting its capacity to generate terms closely aligned with human annotations while maintaining a balance between specificity and accuracy. By advancing the artificial intelligence driven analyses, this work facilitates more informed decision-making in biomedical research, precision oncology, and related fields.

AB  - Prostate cancer is a major public health problem, and early diagnosis is paramount in improving therapy outcomes. The traditional interpretation of MRI is made difficult by the heterogeneity of the gland in tissue composition, which may lead to potential diagnostic variability. This work proposes a machine learning-based framework that employs deep learning methods for accurate and early detection of prostate cancer. The system integrates ResNet with transfer learning to enhance feature extraction and thus complements an existing SVM classifier in making final decisions. Pre-processing steps enhance image quality, followed by automatic segmentation of regions of interest using advanced segmentation. The integration of deep feature extraction and machine learning classification improves diagnostic accuracy with minimal human intervention. The novelty is the integration of transfer learning with conventional classifiers, which enables improved interpretability and efficiency. By providing a holistic and automated diagnostic system, the system helps clinicians make timely and accurate clinical decisions, which ultimately lead to better patient outcomes.

AB  - Diagnostic discrepancies, a persistent threat in healthcare, compromise patient outcomes and hinder effective treatment. Despite their prevalence, addressing diagnostic discrepancies remains a complex challenge due to the limitations of traditional methods and fragmented and inaccessible data. The emergence of machine learning (ML) offers a promising solution by analyzing vast medical datasets to detect subtle disease signatures and improve treatment personalization with unparalleled precision. However, data quality and availability remain significant barriers, as incompleteness, inconsistencies, and biases can distort ML models, leading to potentially harmful misinterpretations. This paper highlights the critical role of diagnostic discrepancy statistics in overcoming these challenges and proposes a standardized data schema that ensures interoperable, real-time, and historical data without compromising patient privacy. By addressing the current lack of accessible diagnostic discrepancy data, the schema lays a foundation for more effective analysis, better patient outcomes, and improved use of machine learning in healthcare. The key contribution of this paper is the framework that allows for increased data transparency and improved data quality.

AB  - A major complication of diabetes, Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are recognized by significant health outcomes when detected early. In this work, we propose the novel hybrid CNN-SVM model for accurate and scalable DFU detection that combines feature extraction strengths of deep learning and reliable classification power of machine learning. We evaluate the proposed model on the publicly available DFUC2021 dataset of 5000 annotated DFU images and that are split into 60%, 20% and 20% training, validation and testing set respectively. Or, this hybrid approach demonstrated a stunning accuracy of 94.5% which surpassed both the standalone CNN model with 91.2% specificity, and the traditional SVM classifier with handcrafted features at 82.5%. In addition, it exhibits higher precision (93.2%), recall (93.8%), F1 score (93.5%) and on an AUC - ROC of 0.98, attesting to its ability to discriminate between DFU and non - DFU cases better. To implemented the CNN component, based on the ResNet-50 architecture, for extracting deep hierarchical features and the SVM classifier with RBF kernel for generating robust decision boundaries thereby reducing over fitting and improving generalization. Experimental results, along with confusion matrix analysis and ROC curve evaluation, show that the model has potential to be applied in clinic, achieving significant reduction of false positives and false negatives. Proposed hybrid approach to detect DFU proposes a scalable and efficient solution for DFU detection that can be deployed for real world healthcare and telemedicine applications. Further work will investigate merging explainable Al techniques to add interpretability to the model and extending the model for multi class DFU classification.

AB  - The rise in maternal mortality rates, particularly in rural areas, underscores the urgent need for accurate and interpreted diagnostic tools to help healthcare professionals make informed decisions about delivery methods. This study proposes an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)-based classification model for predicting delivery methods (vaginal or cesarean) using the Random Forest algorithm, enhanced with Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME). The model was developed through Design Science Research methodology and trained on 300 medical records from midwifery practices in the rural Bandung Regency. Data preprocessing involved data cleaning, categorical feature encoding, and train-test splitting. Model performance optimization was achieved using hyperparameter tuning via RandomizedSearchCV. Evaluation metrics included accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix analysis, and validation through 5-fold cross-validation to ensure robustness and generalizability. The results showed an accuracy of 95%, with F1-scores of 0.96 for vaginal delivery and 0.94 for cesarean section. LIME visualizations identified abnormal fetal position, prior cesarean history, and fetal macrosomia as key predictors influencing cesarean outcomes. Despite promising results, the model's generalizability might be limited by the exclusive use of six clinical features and data from a single rural region. This study shows that the model provides accurate and transparent predictions, making it useful for supporting maternal care in low-resource settings.

AB  - As a complex neural network system, the brain regions and genes collaborate to effectively store and transmit information. We abstract the collaboration correlations as the brain region gene community network (BG-CN) and present a new deep learning approach, such as the community graph convolutional neural network (Com-GCN), for investigating the transmission of information within and between communities. The results can be used for diagnosing and extracting causal factors for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). First, an affinity aggregation model for BG-CN is developed to describe intercommunity and intracommunity information transmission. Second, we design the Com-GCN architecture with intercommunity convolution and intracommunity convolution operations based on the affinity aggregation model. Through sufficient experimental validation on the AD neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) dataset, the design of Com-GCN matches the physiological mechanism better and improves the interpretability and classification performance. Furthermore, Com-GCN can identify lesioned brain regions and disease-causing genes, which may assist precision medicine and drug design in AD and serve as a valuable reference for other neurological disorders.

AB  - Hair artifacts in dermoscopic images significantly hinder the accurate diagnosis of melanoma and other skin conditions by obscuring critical lesion details. To address this challenge, we introduce DPA-HairNet, a novel Dual Encoder Attention-Based Network designed specifically for effective hair artifact removal while preserving lesion integrity. The model features a dual encoder architecture to separately process hair-specific and lesion-specific features, an attention mechanism to prioritize diagnostically relevant regions, and a dual-output design that generates precise hair segmentation masks and high-quality reconstructed images. This study leverages the ISIC 2018 and HAM10000 datasets, incorporating advanced data augmentation techniques to enhance dataset diversity and ensure robust model training. DPA-HairNet was evaluated against six state-of-the-art segmentation models using comprehensive metrics, including Accuracy, Dice Coefficient, Jaccard Index, PSNR, MAE, Specificity, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, where the proposed model outperformed all models. Furthermore, classification performance was assessed before and after hair artifact removal using twelve pre-trained classifiers, demonstrating significant improvements in diagnostic accuracy. Explainable AI techniques, Grad-CAM, UMAP and attention heatmaps, were employed to interpret and validate the model’s focus. These results underscore DPA-HairNet’s effectiveness and potential integration into clinical workflows to enhance dermoscopic image analysis and diagnosis. Future work will explore generalization to additional artifact types and optimization for real-time clinical deployment.

AB  - Substantial progress has been made in developing deep-learning models for clinical diagnosis. While excelling in diagnostics, the broader clinical decision-making process also involves establishing optimal follow-up intervals (TCU), crucial for prognosis and timely treatment. To fully support clinical practice, it is imperative that deep learning models contribute to both initial diagnosis and TCU prediction. However, relying on separate monolithic models is computationally demanding and lacks interpretability, hindering clinician trust. Our proposed bilateral model, emphasizing ophthalmological cases, offers both initial diagnoses and follow-up predictions, enhancing interpretability and trust in clinical applications as clinicians are more likely to trust recommendations, knowing the diagnosis used is correct. Inspired by clinical practice, the model integrates hierarchical inference and self-supervised learning techniques to enhance predictive accuracy and interpretability. Consisting of a sparse autoencoder, diagnosis classifier, and TCU classifier, the model leverages insights from clinicians and observations of ophthalmological datasets to capture salient features and facilitate robust learning. By employing shared weights for encoding and diagnosing each organ, the model optimizes efficiency and doubles the effective dataset size. Experimental results on an ophthalmological dataset demonstrate superior performance compared to baseline models, with the hierarchical inference structure providing valuable insights into the model's decision-making process. The bilateral model not only enhances predictive modeling for conditions affecting bilaterally symmetrical organs but also empowers clinicians with interpretable outputs crucial for informed clinical decision-making, thereby advancing clinical practice and improving patient care.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most common cause of death globally, and thus the need for early and accurate diagnosis systems becomes even more important. The present paper proposes a hybrid predictive model that combines Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to process clinical data and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image diagnosis. The combination of image data and preprocessed structured patient data enables the model to take advantage of strengths in machine learning and deep learning techniques. Preprocessing and XGBoost-optimizing clinical features are left to CNN to extract complex visual patterns from images involving cardiology. Outputs of both the models are combined to improve the reliability of predictions and reduce error from single-modal analysis. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) provides interpretability through ensuring that there is insight into the decision made by the model. The suggested system was tested on a large multimodal dataset and resulted in a classification accuracy of more than 90 %, which was 8-12% higher than that of individual models. The method exhibits robustness, enhanced generalization, and the ability to aid healthcare professionals with proactive and accurate tools for the early detection and intervention of CVD.

AB  - Deep learning models, notably convolutional neural networks (CNNs), demonstrate great promise in medical image processing. Nonetheless, CNNs frequently encounter challenges in capture holistic context and long- range dependencies in high-resolution images, which are crucial for accurate medical diagnostics. A new state-of-the-art technique called Vision Transformers (ViTs) uses self-attention mechanisms for gathering global correlations between image patches, thereby addressing some of the inherent limitations of CNNs. This study investigates the application of ViTs for diagnosing breast cancer from ultrasound images of tumor. The findings suggest that ViTs not only achieve competitive accuracy in identifying breast cancer lesions but also offer superior interpretability through attention mechanism, which can aid clinicians in understanding model decisions. This paper highlights the potential of ViTs as a powerful tool in medical imaging, particularly for breast cancer diagnosis, and outlines future research directions for enhancing clinical applicability.

Current approaches often rely on single data modalities, lack interpretability, and compromise data privacy through centralized models, limiting their scalability and applicability in real-world clinical settings, especially in sparse and noisy data environments. This research aims to address these challenges through a multi-objective framework encompassing advanced machine-learning techniques. The first objective focuses on developing a clinical imaging-genetic data fusion model using self-supervised graph neural networks to manage sparse datasets, achieving accuracy gains of 92–94% and improving AUC-ROC scores by 5–8% over baseline models. The second objective introduces the Federated Meta-Learning Framework for Liver Disease Prediction (FML-LDP), enabling privacy-preserving, collaborative model training across institutions. This framework achieves precision levels of 88–91%, reduces computational overhead by 15–20%, and ensures adaptability to diverse patient scenarios. The third objective addresses the need for interpretability through the Explainable Deep Learning Framework with Reinforcement Learning Optimization (EDL-RL), which dynamically selects optimal features using reinforcement learning. This framework enhances interpretability by 25–30%, integrates Shapley-value-based feature explanations, and maintains high predictive accuracy (90–93%) to improve clinical trust.By integrating multi-modal data learning, privacy-preserving collaboration, and interpretable AI, this work provides a robust and scalable solution for liver disease prediction, setting a new benchmark for clinical decision support systems.

AB  - Objective: Many healthcare problems involve complex patient trajectories represented as Multivariate Time Series (MTS), with predictions often coming as Time Series (TS) outputs. Despite recent advances, these “MTS-to-TS” inference tasks remain challenging due to data irregularity, temporal dependencies, and the need for clinical explainability. To address these demands, we propose novel eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods for “MTS-to-TS” architectures, enabling tracking of patient evolution and identification of key variable patterns associated with adverse outcomes. We evaluate our approach on private ICU data from the University Hospital of Fuenlabrada (UHF) for Multidrug Resistance (MDR) prediction and the public HiRID dataset (circulatory failure). Methods: We introduce three XAI techniques: i) Irregular Time SHapley Additive exPlanation (IT-SHAP), a post-hoc extension of TimeSHAP to TS outputs; ii) Hadamard Attention, an intrinsic mechanism for capturing temporal dependencies; and iii) Causal Conditional Mutual Information, a pre-hoc approach for feature selection. Results: MDR prediction achieved highest performance with a GRU using Hadamard Attention (ROC-AUC=0.783$\pm$0.023), while circulatory failure was best predicted with LSTM (ROC–AUC of 0.9970$\pm$1.6e$^{-3}$). In terms of explainability, IT-SHAP uncovered clinically relevant risk factors—early antibiotic use and bacterial cultures—later validated by UHF clinicians. Conclusion: Our framework offers temporal explainability in “MTS-to-TS” architectures, allowing clinicians to trace disease trajectories and understand the contribution of each variable at each time step. Significance: Integrating explainable MDR risk predictions into EHR systems enables early interventions, improved antimicrobial stewardship, and infection control. The framework's scalability to other ICU challenges underscores its clinical impact.

AB  - Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of global mortality through the narrowing of coronary arteries from plaque buildup, which restricts blood flow to the heart. Recent studies indicate the genetic underpinnings of CAD and how complex genetic variations affect its occurrence. However, the scarcity and heterogeneity of genetic datasets make it difficult to predict CAD with a high degree of accuracy, particularly for rare critical variants. The combination of patient medical history, clinical variables, and genetic information through machine learning algorithms enhances the prediction of CAD. However, techniques such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM have the potential but are limited in their predictive capabilities due to data quality and representation issues. This work proposes the use of GANs as a solution to overcome these inherent difficulties - generating synthetic genetic variants that can capture the nuances in real - world data. The GAN-simulated data closely mimics true patterns of genetic variants and hence reveals complex genetic interactions. Addition of the GAN-simulated data to the CAD prediction model significantly improves the generalization capability across different populations, reducing bias and allowing an improved estimation of risk. In conjunction with explainable AI techniques, this GAN-based approach would enable prevention for individuals at higher risk of developing CAD. Though GANs offer a lot of promise, overcoming challenges like overfitting and mode collapse as well as ethics associated with using synthetic data calls for a judicious approach for their proper application in the clinic.

AB  - Early and accurate disease prognosis remains a critical challenge in modern healthcare, especially when clinical data is high-dimensional, heterogeneous, and incomplete. This paper proposes a novel Transformer-Based Multi-Modal Deep Learning Framework that synergistically integrates Electronic Health Records (EHR) and medical imaging data to predict disease progression at an early stage. Leveraging the power of Vision Transformers (ViT) for image modality and TabTransformer for structured EHR data, our model captures both spatial and contextual patterns, enabling robust prognostic predictions. The framework employs a cross-attention fusion module to align and integrate features from the two modalities, ensuring effective information transfer. We evaluate our model on two publicly available datasets: MIMIC-IV for EHR and NIH Chest X-ray14 for imaging. The results demonstrate significant improvements in AUC, F1-score, and accuracy compared to existing multi-modal and single-modality baselines. Additionally, we incorporate a SHAP-based interpretability module to provide transparent decision-making for clinicians. This study highlights the potential of transformer-based multi-modal learning to revolutionize early disease prognosis, supporting timely and personalized medical interventions.

AB  - This study proposes an innovative diabetes prediction chatbot that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to determine the likelihood of diabetes based on specific patient inputs. Unlike conventional machine learning models and in addition to providing precise, individualized, robust prediction of diabetes augmented by the percentage of its confidence, this chatbot provides detailed text-based explanations for its individual predictions and enhances user's understanding by retrieving and presenting similar cases using case-based reasoning techniques. Utilizing key health indicators such as hypertension status, heart disease presence, smoking history, BMI, HbA1c level, and blood glucose levels, the chatbot not only predicts the presence of diabetes but also educates users about the underlying reasons for each prediction. The system's explanation module promotes transparency and trust in the predictive process. The proposed architecture integrates the retrieval augmented generation (RAG) technique with prompt engineering across multiple LLMs, including Llama 3.1, GPT- 3.5, and Gemma2. This approach augments the chatbot's responses with contextually relevant data from similar past cases, thereby enhancing both relevance and accuracy. Furthermore, RAG minimizes LLM hallucinations while enhancing them with up-to-date, precise, personalized medical information. The objective of this chatbot is to offer healthcare professionals and patients a dependable, educational instrument for early detection of diabetes supported by transparent AI principles. This will have a positive effect on preventative healthcare measures.

Its prevalence in Sri Lanka is increasing due to limited public awareness and delays in diagnosis caused by resource constraints in the healthcare system. To facilitate early and efficient detection, this study proposes a deep learning model for DR detection in Sri Lankan patients. A dataset of 272 retinal fundus images was collected from a Sri Lankan hospital and used to train a model based on the MobileNet architecture, achieving an accuracy of 99.19%. The study faced limitations due to the small dataset size. Future work will focus on collecting retinal fundus images from across the island to enhance the dataset and improve model performance.

AB  - Infectious/contagious diseases remain a significant global health challenge, necessitating accurate identification to mitigate their spread. The widespread adoption of wearable healthcare devices capable of continuously monitoring physiological parameters presents a unique opportunity for enhancing disease detection strategies. In this article, we develop a new data fusion-enabled explainable artificial intelligence-assisted light gradient boosting model (LightGBM) (FuXAI) model in edge networks to predict contagious disease in the early stage. The overall contributions of the proposed FuXAI model are threefold. First, we create a comprehensive health profile for each individual by employing data fusion techniques and integrating health parameters received from multiple sources. Second, we integrate a new lightweight machine learning (ML) model, the LightGBM, to predict the disease at resource-constraint edge devices over the fused data. Finally, we leverage the power of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to develop interpretable algorithms, integrating with the LightGBM that can identify subtle patterns and correlations within the fused data, potentially revealing early warning signs of infectious diseases and creating trust in medical professionals during decision-making. Extensive simulation results of the proposed model over the standard ML models using benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the model.

AB  - This work explores the Random Forest classifier's effectiveness in analyzing healthcare data for predicting stroke risks. In this study, data preprocessing is done intensively, which ranges from handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and handling class imbalance, where the data is oversampled using SMOTE to balance the data between stroke and no-stroke cases. After preprocessing, the proposed approach uses the Random Forest classifier to predict the possibility of a stroke in people for the processed data. Further, features related to model selection and characteristics, including a grid search that incorporates cross-validation, are used to fine-tune the classifier for the best results. The performance of the developed Random Forest model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Moreover, the interpretability of the model is examined to determine which factors affect stroke prediction. The results prove that the Random Forest classifier has high potential in the prediction of stroke risks with 94.42% accuracy, using advanced model selection and tuning techniques. Therefore, this study contributes towards clinical applications employing the Random Forest method, especially when applied with a preprocessing approach such as SMOTE, which can be beneficial in clinical settings for its ability to assess stroke risk mutually with approaches pertinent for healthcare practitioners and academics.

AB  - With advancements in artificial intelligence, it is natural for the health industry to focus on IOT devices. AI could promote a paradigm shift in how doctors and patients interact through immediate updates, predictive features, and remote access. The focus of this study is the outreach and employment aspects revolving around AI-enabled health care, with special attention to mHealth solutions. We searched through published data and came across 112 relevant studies identifying keywords such as accessibility, empowerment, and workforce. One of the most interesting findings was the fact that AI targeting mobile applications has the possibility of increasing access to health services by approximately 60 percent for rural areas, as well as increasing the patient cooperative rate by approximately 45%, where a predictive health tracking device has been utilized. We proposed two new measures: the Physical Activity and Nutrition Index (PANI) and Health Status Index (HSI), allowing for better diabetes risk predictions with a 0.82 AUC-ROC and better generalizability than traditional baselines, with an improvement of 12%. When identifying the best available ML models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Bayesian Neural Networks, we found that the hybrid Random Forest + Linear SVC model had the best performance with recall and accuracy of 0.77 and 0.72, respectively. The ability of the model to demonstrate both interpretability and specificity was evident. It was also observed that synthetic data augmentation (SMOTE) increased the recall for minority class predictions by 18% but did not reduce specificity.

AB  - Improving the drug development process can expedite the introduction of more novel drugs that cater to the demands of precision medicine. Accurately predicting molecular properties remains a fundamental challenge in drug discovery and development. Currently, a plethora of computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) methods have been widely employed in the field of molecular prediction. However, most of these methods primarily analyze molecules using low-dimensional representations such as SMILES notations, molecular fingerprints, and molecular graph-based descriptors. Only a few approaches have focused on incorporating and utilizing high-dimensional spatial structural representations of molecules. In light of the advancements in artificial intelligence, we introduce a 3D graph-spatial co-representation model called AEGNN-M, which combines two graph neural networks, GAT and EGNN. AEGNN-M enables learning of information from both molecular graphs representations and 3D spatial structural representations to predict molecular properties accurately. We conducted experiments on seven public datasets, three regression datasets and 14 breast cancer cell line phenotype screening datasets, comparing the performance of AEGNN-M with state-of-the-art deep learning methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the satisfactory performance of the AEGNN-M model. Furthermore, we analyzed the performance impact of different modules within AEGNN-M and the influence of spatial structural representations on the model's performance. The interpretability analysis also revealed the significance of specific atoms in determining particular molecular properties.

AB  - Neonatal cardiac arrest, particularly in preterm infants admitted to Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs), is a serious condition with a need for early and accurate detection. This study proposes a hybrid framework combining deep learning models with statistical techniques that can improve the reliability and accuracy of predictions for the occurrence of cardiac arrest in neonates. Using the Preterm Infant Cardio- Respiratory Signals Database, we extract spatial features from ECG and respiratory signals using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and capture temporal dependencies using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The framework is complemented by statistical models, including Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests, to enhance classification robustness and interpretability. The proposed system preprocesses raw physiological signals to remove noise, extracts meaningful features, and generates real-time predictions with high Accuracy of 92. Comparative analysis with existing methods demonstrates significant improvements in performance, highlighting the system's potential for early detection and real-time intervention in NICUs. This hybrid approach not only improves neonatal survival rates but also ensures interpretability, enabling healthcare providers to make confident and informed decisions.

AB  - The integration of multi-modal healthcare data—encompassing electronic health records (EHRs), medical imaging, and unstructured clinical notes—holds transformative potential for predictive analytics but remains underexplored due to challenges in data heterogeneity and interpretability. This paper introduces a hierarchical attention-based fusion framework to predict sepsis onset 6 hours prior to clinical diagnosis, leveraging temporal (EHRs), spatial (chest X-rays), and textual (radiology notes) data. The proposed model employs modality-specific encoders: a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) for EHR time-series, a ResNet-50 pretrained on chest X-rays, and a BioBERT transformer for clinical text. A novel cross-modal attention mechanism dynamically aligns features across modalities, addressing missing data and sampling rate disparities. Evaluated on a multi-center ICU dataset of 12,000 patients, the framework achieves an AUC-ROC of 94.3% (18% improvement over EHR-only models) and reduces false negatives by 22%, demonstrating statistically significant improvements (p < 0.001) in early sepsis detection. Clinical simulations reveal a 14% reduction in ICU mortality through timely interventions, validated by physician feedback. This work advances multi-modal fusion strategies for high-stakes clinical decision-making while maintaining interpretability via SHAP-based explainability.

AB  - In this study, we introduce two innovative hybrid models designed for predicting individual pharmacy costs: the Autoencoder-Gated Recurrent Unit (Auto-GRU) and the GoogLeNet-Residual Network (GR-Net). Utilizing data from high utilizers obtained through the Medicaid rebate program, these models aim to provide accurate predictions of total pharmacy costs for individual patients. Our approach involves rigorous data preprocessing, including the removal of missing values, and the fine-tuning of hyperparameters using the Adam optimizer. We systematically evaluate and compare the performance of these hybrid models with that of four individual models, Autoencoder (AE), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), GoogLeNet, and Residual Network (ResNet), using performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), training time, inference time and memory usage. Without correlation, Auto-GRU outperformed its individual models with an MSE value of 0.1675 versus GRU’s MSE of 0.2806 and AE’s MSE of 0.4086. GR-Net, without correlation, also beats the individual models with an MSE value of 0.0027 versus GoogLeNet’s MSE value of 0.0106 and ResNet’s MSE value of 0.0201. Similarly, with correlation, Auto-GRU outperformed its individual models with an MSE value of 0.2655 versus GRU’s MSE of 0.4089 and AE’s MSE of 0.4243. GR-Net, with correlation, also beats the individual models with an MSE value of 0.0097 versus GoogLeNet’s MSE value of 0.0882 and ResNet’s MSE value of 0.0106. Both the hybrid models outperformed the individual models in terms of MAE, MAE and RMSE both with and without correlation. Also, to interpret models prediction, we have implemented Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations, an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) technique. These findings highlight the robustness and effectiveness of the hybrid models in predicting pharmacy costs, underscoring their potential for integration into healthcare expense management systems.

AB  - Interpreting and communicating electrocardiogram (ECG) findings are crucial yet challenging tasks in cardiovascular diagnosis, traditionally requiring significant expertise and precise clinical communication. This paper presents Cardi-GPT v2(hereafter referred to as Cardi-GPT2), an enhanced version of our previously proposed expert system [1], by introducing a transformer-based model extension and an adaptive feedback mechanism to improve both ECG interpretation and clinician interaction. By augmenting an 8 -layer CNN backbone with a transformer encoder, Cardi-GPT2 achieves a weighted accuracy of 0.7508 across 24 cardiac conditions in processing 12-lead ECG data. A novel fuzzification layer translates predictions into intuitive linguistic terms, while a conversational chatbot facilitates interactive explanations and allows real-time expert feedback. The system dynamically updates its knowledge base, fuzzification logic, and model weights through continual learning, employing Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) to preserve prior knowledge during feedback-driven fine-tuning. Evaluated on a diverse dataset spanning six hospitals across four countries, Cardi-GPT2 demonstrates superior diagnostic performance and a chatbot response quality score of $\mathbf{7 8. 4 \%}$. By bridging the gap between intricate ECG data interpretation and actionable clinical insights, Cardi-GPT2 represents a transformative innovation in cardiovascular healthcare, promising to improve diagnostic accuracy, clinical workflows, and patient outcomes across diverse medical settings.

AB  - Stroke is a leading cause of disability worldwide, often causing gait impairments that limit a person’s mobility and independence. Accurate gait analysis is critical for effective rehabilitation, but traditional evaluation approaches are based on clinical observations that lack precision and consistency and are affected by the physiotherapist’s experience. Deep learning models, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, have been shown to have potential in gait analysis but their reliance on huge datasets restricts its relevance to stroke rehabilitation since patient-specific gait patterns have significant variability. This review explores the potential of current state-of-the-art models utilizing motion sensor data (IMU) towards learning individual strokesurvivors’ unique gait characteristics, to be studied by physiotherapists through simulation for developing individualized recovery plans. This study recommends CNNLSTM architecture, Few-Shot Learning (FSL) approaches, and synthetic data generation to address data scarcity and enhance model personalization for stroke gait analysis. However, challenges such as model complexity, clinical interpretability, lack of resolution in IMU sources and the reliability of synthetic data are some of the highlighted obstacles that demand attention for future work.

AB  - Alongside insufficient traditional health care practices, the contemporary world of information has no mechanisms to ensure the safety of patient information simply because the execution of cyber-attacks and data breaches is so easy. These breaches are made easy by storage with a single location used for the whole area that is the type of infrastructure. Blockchain technology secures the system that only the employees are allowed to access the systems which require Electronic Health Records (EHR) information through limiting access. This research is aimed at ascertaining the reduction in the average margin of the middleman and a decrease in security risk with the adoption of blockchain technology that guarantees the information of the patient is tamper proof and traceable. A combination of digital contracts (smart contracts), hashing cryptographic data, and DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology) can ensure the control of who can access the data, while still allowing some limited access, thus a secure data transfer is guaranteed. The patient is at the controlling side of identity management through Blockchain, in which only certain parties have access to his/her information. Also, in the study, the assessed model of Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) was utilized along-side the comparison of PoW and PoS. The examples demonstrate how blockchain technology is able to add security, transparency, and an audit trail to document transactions in the healthcare industry which is what it needs most. Implementing these safeguards would outline the conditions required to allow prominent usage of future study development would primarily concentrate on the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and smart health data, as well as the extension of scale if any, whose configuration had already taken place.

AB  - Using the abundance of genetic data available, cancer categorization using genomic data is an important field of study aimed at improving the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of different forms of cancer. Genomic data offers a full picture of the molecular mechanisms behind cancer. This data includes gene expression levels, DNA methylation patterns, copy number variations, and mutations. However, reliable cancer classification is severely hampered by the enormous dimensionality and complexity of these datasets. It is suggested that in order to improve the performance and interpretability of the classification model in cancer data, this hybrid technique should make use of both SVM and other traditional PCA. In order to improve performance while maintaining biological relevance in genomic characteristics, the approach entails employing PCA to reduce the dimensions. After that, the reduced dataset's complicated patterns are found using the SVM model. The strategy is put to the test to see how well it handles high-dimensional genetic data and what potential it creates for improving cancer detection and customized treatment regimens.

AB  - Most often, skin diseases affect millions around the world and hence require early and accurate diagnosis for appropriate treatment. Visual examination, biopsy, which can be time consuming and subjective, are traditional methods of dermatological diagnosis. The objective of this study is to determine the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for automated skin disease categorization in order to increase diagnostic accuracy and speed. On a diverse dataset, a ResNet50 based deep learning model was trained with a validation accuracy of 94.81%. The model was able to precisely classify the skin conditions such as melanoma, leprosy as well as eczema. The results show that CNN based models close the gap between dermatologists and primary care providers in rural and underserved areas. Even so, its strength is hindered by the dataset diversity, model interpretability, and ethical concerns of clinical deployment. Overall this study shows the possibility of using AI in dermatology for diagnosis of skin disease and the availability of a quality healthcare to the people.

AB  - Data fusion, which involves combining signals from multiple sensors simultaneously, enhances the accuracy of inferences drawn from complex datasets. This article presents a fusion method for multisensor data that utilizes 1-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D-CNNs) to integrate the decisions of individual models detecting the same events across different physiological signals. The approach is designed to improve diagnostic accuracy by analyzing the degree of agreement between the decisions of these models. To further assist healthcare practitioners in their decision-making process, especially when discrepancies arise between the models, the fusion method incorporates explainable AI techniques, specifically the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME). These techniques provide insights into the model's decision-making process, making it easier for practitioners to trust the results. The proposed fusion architecture is specifically evaluated for atrial fibrillation detection using two multimodal signal inputs from a subset of the MIMIC III database. In this case, the fusion algorithm employs 1D-CNN-based models to detect atrial fibrillation from electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals. The individual ECG and PPG models achieved high accuracies of 98.85% and 98.52%, with sensitivities of 100% and 99.39%, respectively. When the models were fused based on their agreement, the output demonstrated even better performance, achieving an accuracy of 99.85% and sensitivity of 99.80%. This approach underscores the potential of CNN-based fusion techniques in enhancing the reliability of physiological event detection.

AB  - This paper presents a novel framework for medical data assessment that integrates automated AI analysis, SHAP-based interpretability, and human feedback to generate comprehensive medical reports. Our approach employs a logistic regression model evaluated on a heart disease dataset, demonstrating robust performance across training, validation, and test splits. The framework uses SHAP values to provide transparent, quantitative insights into the influence of each clinical parameter on the prediction outcome. By incorporating human feedback as the definitive ground truth, the system refines its outputs, thereby bridging the gap between automated analysis and evolving clinical expertise. This integration addresses common challenges in clinical data including missing entries, coding discrepancies, and heterogeneity across healthcare providers to ensure that the generated reports are both consistent and reliable. The resulting automated report not only reduces the documentation burden on healthcare professionals but also standardizes reporting workflows, ultimately enhancing diagnostic decision-making. Future work will focus on extending the multi-agent framework to encompass additional clinical tasks and on integrating reinforcement learning techniques to enable continuous model improvement based on real-time feedback.

AB  - Accurate and interpretable prediction of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is essential for managing chronic kidney disease (CKD) and supporting clinical decisions. Recent advances in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown strong potential in clinical prediction tasks due to their ability to process visual and textual information. However, challenges related to deployment cost, data privacy, and model reliability hinder their adoption. In this study, we propose a collaborative framework that enhances the performance of open-source LMMs for eGFR forecasting while generating clinically meaningful explanations. The framework incorporates visual knowledge transfer, abductive reasoning, and a short-term memory mechanism to enhance prediction accuracy and interpretability. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves predictive performance and interpretability comparable to proprietary models. It also provides plausible clinical reasoning processes behind each prediction. Our method sheds new light on building AI systems for healthcare that combine predictive accuracy with clinically grounded interpretability.

AB  - Biomedical research often faces challenges with limited dataset sizes, primarily due to privacy concerns limiting aggregation and the high costs associated with data collection. These limitations make it difficult to train effective machine learning models, especially those designed to work with complex, unstructured data such as time-series sequences from medical records, or images and 3D volumes from CT and MRI scans. To address this issue, we propose Adaptive Complexity Deep Neural Networks (ACDNNs), a novel approach designed for small dataset scenarios. ACDNNs tackle the critical challenge of selecting the right model complexity to avoid overfitting in limited data settings. They simultaneously learn and solve problems across a hierarchy of complexity levels, enabling the model to adjust its complexity during evaluation, rather than relying on pre-set assumptions before training begins. We demonstrate that ACDNNs can be trained on small datasets without significant performance loss due to overfitting. In a time-series AKI prediction dataset derived from MIMIC-IV EHR data, ACDNNs show lower training error compared to conventional CNNs on datasets with fewer than 10,000 samples. Additionally, on the BreastMNIST and AdrenalMNIST medical image and 3D volume benchmarks, ACDNNs achieve accuracies of 90.1% and 82.4%, respectively, outperforming modern methods tested by the dataset authors which achieve maximum scores of 86.3% and 80.3% respectively. In exploratory evaluations on structured synthetic and genetic data we observe that ACDNNs excel in problems with large numbers of confounders. We demonstrate that this property can be exploited to aid identification of key predictive objects in medical images.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has profoundly transformed our lives, reshaping industries and impacting nearly every aspect of society over the past few decades. It has recently become even more influential, primarily due to the rise of foundation models representing a new paradigm in AI development. These models, characterized by their large-scale training on vast datasets, have unique capabilities such as emergence and transference, enabling them to generalize across diverse tasks. Since their introduction, foundation models have been increasingly applied in fields such as autonomous driving, computer vision, marketing, finance, industrial robotics, and healthcare. Pathologists worldwide use computational methods to analyze diseases that profoundly impact human well-being, including cancer diagnosis and staging, genetic mutation prediction, and treatment and prognosis forecasting. In this article, we discuss how, despite the promise of foundation models in various applications, their development and application in computational pathology remain challenging due to inherent characteristics such as emergence, homogenization, hallucination, transference, compositionality, and explainability. While powerful, these traits introduce numerous ethical concerns and challenges, impacting safety and reliability, patient privacy, accountability, and equity and fairness in healthcare access. We examine these ethical issues, focusing on key concerns like algorithmic discrimination and misuse, accuracy, privacy breaches, transparency, public accessibility, and accountability. Furthermore, potential solutions to these challenges are analyzed, offering future perspectives on promoting the development and application of more ethical AI and foundation models in computational pathology. These insights aim to guide foundation models toward responsible integration of AI in healthcare.

AB  - Patient forecasting is crucial for healthcare management, enabling optimal resource allocation, improved patient outcomes, and better decision-making in emergency settings. While traditional statistical models like ARIMA continue to be widely used due to their interpretability, their limitations in processing complex and dynamic healthcare data have led to the growing adoption of deep learning (DL) techniques. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based models have shown promising results in the literature, particularly in capturing temporal dependencies. However, their ability to adapt to sudden fluctuations in patient arrivals remains a major challenge, which is critical for effective hospital planning. This study compares several modern deep learning architectures and evaluates their effectiveness in healthcare time series forecasting, aiming to improve predictive accuracy while addressing the challenge of capturing extreme variations in emergency department patient visits. The models assessed include xLSTM variants (xLSTM-Time, xLSTM-Mixer), PatchTST, Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), RWKV-TS, Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), and TimesNet. Our results indicate that PatchTST achieves the lowest forecasting error (RMSE = 13.18, MAPE = 7.17%), demonstrating superior adaptability to complex temporal patterns. However, all models struggle with extreme daily fluctuations, emphasizing the need for more advanced hybrid approaches and the integration of external data sources to enhance robustness and reliability in real-world healthcare applications.

AB  - Heart failure (HF) remains a major global health concern, with early risk prediction playing a crucial role in improving patient outcomes and reducing hospitalization rates. Traditional predictive models often struggle to capture the complex and evolving nature of a patient’s health status over time. To address this challenge, we propose a Temporal Risk Pattern Network (TRPN), a novel approach that leverages time-series electronic health records (EHRs) to identify patterns in disease progression. By incorporating a graph-based structure with temporal attention mechanisms, TRPN dynamically models fluctuations in key clinical indicators, allowing for more accurate and personalized risk assessment. Our model constructs a temporal risk graph, which continuously learns from patient data to detect early warning signals of heart failure. This approach enables the identification of both short-term variations and long-term trends in vital signs, laboratory results, and comorbidities. Using real-world EHR datasets, we evaluate TRPN against traditional machine learning models, demonstrating its superior performance in accuracy, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, the interpretability of the network enhances clinical trust, supporting healthcare providers in making timely and informed decisions. By integrating advanced temporal modeling with predictive analytics, TRPN offers a robust framework for heart failure risk prediction, paving the way for proactive patient management and personalized treatment strategies.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus is a prevalent metabolic disorder that requires early detection to prevent severe complications. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as blood tests, are often invasive, costly, and impractical for routine monitoring. This study proposes a novel, noninvasive diagnostic approach leveraging advanced iris image analysis with Vision Transformers (ViTs). By capturing subtle structural and textural variations in the iris associated with diabetes, our method enables accurate and efficient disease identification. The proposed framework involves preprocessing techniques to enhance crucial iris features, followed by feature extraction and classification using a fine-tuned ViT model. ViTs excel in capturing long-range dependencies and complex patterns, making them well-suited for detecting diabetic indicators within iris textures. Our model is trained and validated on a diverse dataset comprising iris images from both diabetic and non-diabetic individuals, ensuring robustness and generalizability. This non-invasive approach, combined with the interpretability and scalability of ViTs, presents a transformative alternative to conventional diagnostic techniques. By integrating AI-driven healthcare solutions, this research contributes to the advancement of early diabetic detection, offering a practical and accessible tool for proactive disease management.

AB  - The neurodegenerative condition Alzheimer's disease (AD) has phenotypic alterations linked to genetic variations and imaging pathology. AD costs about $250 billion annually and affects 5.8 million Americans. Biomarker genomics, based on brain imaging, has been created to better the AD pathogenesis and early diagnosis. Therefore, effective ways to find AD biomarkers for early diagnosis and medication are needed. Conventional diagnostic methods, focused on postmortem findings and clinical symptoms, struggle to understand genetic, molecular, and neuroanatomical interactions. This noninvasive, high-throughput technique addresses these issues by combining genomic data with multimodal imaging phenotypes. The proposed framework introduces Multimodal Alzheimer’s Disease Diagnostic model (MADM) which integrates Neuroimaging, cognitive assessments, and genetic data to enhance early detection, improve diagnostic accuracy, and personalize treatment strategies. The MADM system analyzes multimodal data, finds illness biomarkers, and predicts progression using powerful AI and ML. This paradigm's thorough and systematic Alzheimer's disease diagnosis includes cognitive test scores, MRI, PET, and genetic indicators including APOE and SNP genotyping. Consolidating data sets is key to precision medicine. This enables targeted therapy and better patient outcomes. Multimodal dementia ratings outperformed MRI and PET scan dementia ratings in predicting MADM progression in healthy control participants, according to ADNI data. In contrast to relying just on genetic data, a combination of neuroimaging, cognitive test scores, and genetic markers was found to be a more effective way to detect patients with stable moderate cognitive impairment. Classification accuracy in the remaining stratified groups was enhanced by combining multimodal data.

AB  - Facial expression recognition (FER) is a critical technology with applications in healthcare, security, and media. However, variations in facial images and biased datasets, particularly concerning gender, often lead to inconsistent predictions. This research evaluates the impact of gender on FER using five deep learning models: Sequential, ResNet-50, DenseNet, MobileNetV2, and InceptionV3. These models were trained and tested on male-only, female-only, and mixed datasets to identify gender bias, determine which algorithms mitigate bias most effectively, and understand which facial expressions are more susceptible to bias. The study employs bias measures like accuracy difference, F-1 score difference and disparate impact. The findings aim to contribute to the development of fairer and more accurate FER systems by addressing gender bias and improving recognition across diverse demographic groups.

A secondary dataset containing 200 samples has been used, including the 5 key features: heart rate, sleep duration, screen time, physical activity and caffeine intake. Stress Levels were classified into 3 classes which are low, medium and high based on the predefined rules. The three supervised machine learning models in this study are used which are Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). These models are created and trained on the dataset. Further, the performance of the models is evaluated through testing data. The dataset is divided into two parts i.e., training data and testing data in the ratio of 80:20. While SVM offered clear linear decision boundaries, the Decision tree model gave simplicity and interpretability. The ANN model comprising of $\mathbf{1 0}$ neurons demonstrate strong ability to learn difficult, non-linear patterns between the characteristics. Supported by 2D and 3D visualization, confusion matrices and prediction accuracy were applied to evaluate the outcomes. This work shows how Artificial Intelligence methods could be used in behavioral monitoring and healthcare.

AB  - As Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems become increasingly embedded in critical aspects of society, concerns about fairness, accountability, transparency, and inclusivity have become central to both academic and industry discourse. While Agile methodologies dominate modern software development, they often lack structured mechanisms to embed ethical reflection and inclusive design into day-to-day workflows. This paper introduces the RAID Framework, or Responsible and Inclusive AI in Agile Development, a conceptual model that integrates Responsible AI principles and inclusive practices directly within Agile ceremonies and artifacts. Developed using a Design Science Research methodology, RAID consists of five modular components: ethics-oriented backlog items, fairness-aware user stories, inclusive personas, a Responsible AI sprint checklist, and ethical retrospective prompts. Each component is mapped to a specific stage in the Scrum process. Scenario-based walkthroughs across various domains, including finance, healthcare, education, and public services, demonstrate the framework’s adaptability and potential to identify ethical risks without compromising team velocity. By embedding ethics and inclusion as core engineering concerns, RAID offers a scalable pathway toward building AI systems that are not only technically robust but also socially responsible.

AB  - Deep learning (DL) is being used by more and more people and organizations to evaluate massive datasets and derive insightful information. Advanced DL algorithms are now frequently used in the healthcare industry to forecast the early start of serious illnesses like cancer, heart disease, and renal failure. Due mostly to delayed detection, cervical cancer continues to be a major worldwide health concern and one of the leading causes of mortality for women. Better survival rates and efficient treatment depend on early detection. This paper proposes a deep learning method based on medical records that uses Bi-LSTM to predict the risk of cervical cancer. Data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation are all part of the methodology. When compared to more conventional techniques like logistic regression and SVM, the suggested model yields an AUC-ROC score of 0.93. Additionally, by emphasizing important risk factors, SHAP improves interpretability. To support the effectiveness of the model, a detailed explanation of the confusion matrix and performance indicators is provided. The applicability of LSTM and BERT approaches to sequential data processing is briefly examined. To classify risk levels, the proposed approach entails pre-processing patient records, extracting key features, and training a deep learning model. The model's ability to support medical practitioners by improving diagnostic accuracy is confirmed by experimental results. Additionally, AI-driven technology enhances conventional diagnostic techniques by lowering the strain on medical staff and providing individualized insights for every patient. By incorporating deep learning into cervical cancer screening, early detection rates might rise, healthcare resource allocation could be optimized, and mortality could eventually decline.

AB  - Sleep, a fundamental physiological process, manifests as a cascade of changes in brain waves, muscle tension, eye movements, and heart and respiratory activities. Monitoring and analyzing sleep and sleep patterns is thus essential for understanding their impact on physical, mental, and emotional health. Traditional methods, exemplified by polysomnography (PSG) and Actigraphy, have long been the gold standards for sleep staging diagnosis but suffer from high costs, subjectivity in data interpretation and patient discomfort. Deep learning (DL), a subset of artificial intelligence, has lately emerged as a transformative force in sleep analysis. This paper comprehensively examines state-of-the-art DL models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) evaluating their exceptional potential to classify sleep stages accurately. The literature survey encompasses studies of various physiological signals through Electroencephalogram (EEG), Electrooculogram (EOG), Electromyogram (EMG), and Electrocardiogram (ECG) for automated sleep staging. Model performances are compared across multiple datasets like SleepEDF, SHHS, and PhysioNet, showeasing high classification accuracies-often exceeding 85%—when leveraging hybrid models with multimodal inputs. Key findings indicate that CNN and hybrid models offer high classification accuracy, particularly when multiple signals are utilized. Despite these advancements, challenges such as data quality, interpretability, and generalizability persist. The findings suggest that DL holds immense promise for improving diagnostic accuracy, scalability, and accessibility in sleep research. Furthermore, this review helps to identify open challenges and opportunities for future research, emphasizing the integration of personalized medicine and cloud-based healthcare solutions.

AB  - Healthcare fraud is a major problem that leads to wasted money and decreased efficiency in medical insurance systems. Traditional fraud-detection methods based on fixed rules struggle to adapt to new scam techniques and often misclassify valid cases as fraudulent. In this article, we put forward a Transformer-Based Anomaly Detection model to enhance fraud detection in medical insurance claims. The model uses self-attention, a feature of transformers, to examine the Medical Malpractice Insurance Dataset and spot unusual patterns by evaluating the reconstruction error thresholds. Developed with PyTorch Lightning, the system’s effectiveness is evaluated through metrics that include AUC-ROC, Silhouette Score, and Confusion Matrix. Our results indicate that this model successfully identifies fraudulent claims while significantly lowering the number of false positives. By providing a scalable and adaptable solution, this approach overcomes the limitations of traditional methods, strengthens the fraud detection framework in the insurance industry, and ultimately protects financial and economic efficiency.

AB  - A third of America's elderly die of Alzheimer's or dementia every year. Treatments like MRI scans and injections can cost thousands of dollars and fail to accommodate individual patient needs. Moreover, prior literature has prioritized disease detection instead of its spread, making treatment less effective over time. While Alzheimer's produces physical changes in the brain, it also causes behavioral changes such as increased repetitiveness or irritability. These changes manifest themselves in writings, a form of emotional expression. The researcher harnessed this phenomenon to develop MindMap, the first webbased tool that maps the progression of Alzheimer's disease in the brain based on the psychological features exhibited in diary entries of early-stage patients. The researcher assessed around 1000 diary entries across a set of patients ($\mathbf{n} \boldsymbol{=} \mathbf{1 0}$) and evaluated the presence of various psychological features such as positivity and sensitivity over time. These behavioral biomarkers were used to develop personalized forecasting models to map the progression of the features within each patient. Numerous models (ARIMA, SARIMAX, and ExponentialSmoothing) were trained and hyperparameter-tuned for this task. The best performing models achieved average MAE, RMSE, and MAPE of about 0.609, 0.775, and 25.4 % respectively on patient test data, indicating high predictive accuracy for each psychological feature. Moreover, the Mann-Whitney U test revealed a high average correlation between forecasts and true progression ($\mathbf{p = 0. 8 8 1}$).

Black-box models, such as neural networks, offer powerful prediction capabilities but lack interpretability, while traditional models like support vector machines (SVMs) provide transparency, but struggle with complex data distributions. This research aims to develop an interpretable feature extraction method by combining Dictionary Learning (DL) with SVMs. By incorporating classifier loss into the DL process, a joint optimization scheme is proposed using the alternate direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Experiments on the MNIST dataset show promising results, with extensions to multi-class classification and a novel rank-one projection formulation for interpretability.

AB  - Recent advances in prototypical learning have shown remarkable potential to provide useful decision interpretations associating activation maps and predictions with class-specific training prototypes. Such prototypical learning has been well-studied for various single-label diseases, but for quite relevant and more challenging multi-label diagnosis, where multiple diseases are often concurrent within an image, existing prototypical learning models struggle to obtain meaningful activation maps and effective class prototypes due to the entanglement of the multiple diseases. In this paper, we present a novel Cross- and Intra-image Prototypical Learning (CIPL) framework, for accurate multi-label disease diagnosis and interpretation from medical images. CIPL takes advantage of common cross-image semantics to disentangle the multiple diseases when learning the prototypes, allowing a comprehensive understanding of complicated pathological lesions. Furthermore, we propose a new two-level alignment-based regularisation strategy that effectively leverages consistent intra-image information to enhance interpretation robustness and predictive performance. Extensive experiments show that our CIPL attains the state-of-the-art (SOTA) classification accuracy in two public multi-label benchmarks of disease diagnosis: thoracic radiography and fundus images. Quantitative interpretability results show that CIPL also has superiority in weakly-supervised thoracic disease localisation over other leading saliency- and prototype-based explanation methods.

AB  - Visual impairment presents a significant barrier to independent mobility and personal safety for millions worldwide. This work introduces a deep learning-based assistive system built on the YOLOv4-tiny architecture, designed to support visually impaired users through real-time object detection, distance measurement, and navigation assistance. Unlike earlier YOLOv3-or YOLOv5-based aids that often trade off speed for accuracy or lack efficient feedback mechanisms, the proposed system strikes a balance between high-speed processing and high-precision detection. It uniquely integrates auditory and haptic feedback mechanisms to promptly alert users to nearby obstacles (within a 30-inch threshold) and potholes, addressing challenges in dynamic environments. Experimental evaluation demonstrates strong system performance, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.93, an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.89, and a precision score of 0.97 on the KITTI dataset, all while maintaining real-time processing speeds of 45 frames per second. Supplementary dynamic visualizations—such as continuous distance-time plots and periodic object class histograms—provide operational transparency and aid in system calibration. Notably, the system outperforms YOLOv3-based implementations by 20% in detection accuracy and operates with a latency of under 50 milliseconds, ensuring a seamless user experience on low-power edge devices. These results affirm the solution’s potential as a scalable, cost-effective mobility aid for visually impaired individuals in real-world, diverse environments.

AB  - Precise quantification of protein-ligand interaction is critical in early-stage drug discovery. Artificial intelligence (AI) has gained massive popularity in this area, with deep-learning models used to extract features from ligand and protein molecules. However, these models often fail to capture intermolecular non-covalent interactions, the primary factor influencing binding, leading to lower accuracy and interpretability. Moreover, such models overlook the spatial structure of protein-ligand complexes, resulting in weaker generalization. To address these issues, we propose Non-covalent Interaction-aware Graph Neural Network (NciaNet), a novel method that effectively utilizes intermolecular non-covalent interactions and 3D protein-ligand structure. Our approach achieves excellent predictive performance on multiple benchmark datasets and outperforms competitive baseline models in the binding affinity task, with the benchmark core set v.2016 achieving an RMSE of 1.208 and an R of 0.833, and the core set v.2013 achieving an RMSE of 1.409 and an R of 0.805, under the high-quality refined v.2016 training conditions. Importantly, NciaNet successfully learns vital features related to protein-ligand interactions, providing biochemical insights and demonstrating practical utility and reliability.

AB  - Incorporating deep learning into computer-aided medical diagnosis has led to significant advancements. However, a major challenge remains in interpreting deep learning models, especially in identifying the features critical for diagnosis. This study proposes a method for the early detection of colorectal cancer. The method uses the dyadic wavelet packet transform, root mean square, and zero count metrics to extract meaningful features from endoscopic images. These features effectively capture variations in pixel values and delineate contours and patterns. A standout strength of the proposed method lies in its interpretability. The direct feature extraction process enhances both the method’s transparency and the classification results’ comprehensibility. Furthermore, by analyzing the mean absolute values of principal component scores, we provide insightful explanations for misclassification cases, offering a deeper understanding of the classification mechanics. We experimentally evaluated the performance of the proposed method against five deep learning models on three diverse datasets. The results showed that our method achieved a validation accuracy of 99.2% on the Saga University Hospital dataset, 97.4% on the Kvasir-SEG dataset, and 97.8% on the CVC-ClinicDB dataset. These scores surpassed all other models tested, with precision, recall, and F1-measure values consistently higher across datasets, highlighting the method’s robustness and potential for reliable early colorectal cancer detection.

This study introduces a robust prediction framework utilizing the CatBoost algorithm, specifically tailored for handling categorical and imbalanced datasets. The Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset was employed to assess the performance of CatBoost in comparison with traditional classifiers including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and k-Nearest Neighbors. Evaluation was based on key metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, and AUC-ROC. CatBoost consistently achieved superior results, showcasing its ability to handle the intricacies of medical data effectively. Furthermore, to enhance transparency in predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values were applied to interpret feature contributions, offering clear insights into the clinical relevance of each variable. These findings demonstrate that CatBoost not only delivers high predictive accuracy but also supports interpretability, making it a strong candidate for integration into AI-driven diagnostic systems in healthcare.

AB  - Facial Expression Recognition (FER) plays a pivotal role in emotion processing, as facial expressions are primary source for perceiving human emotions. Over the past two decades, research in affective computing has significantly advanced, particularly in areas such as FER, speech emotion recognition, emotion recognition from physiological signals, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and robotics. This study focuses on FER, emphasizing the importance of interpretability and transparency in its applications across healthcare, education, industry, and transportation. We propose distributed frameworks for classifying seven discrete emotions—anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, neutral, and surprise—using Action Units (AUs) from the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). These AUs effectively describe facial muscle movements and capture subtle variations in facial expressions. Our approach leverages benchmark datasets, including AffectNet, FER2013 and CK+48, which contains millions of labeled facial images, and employs distributed machine learning to enable scalable data processing. Experimental results indicates that logistic regression outperforms other multiclass classification algorithms, achieving a classification accuracy of 99.88%. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis was used, which helped to highlight the contribution of specific AUs to emotion predictions, enhancing model interpretability. The distributed framework further improves classification performance by training multiple models on distinct subsets of data or focusing on specific facial regions, resolving ambiguities in similar emotion classes, and reducing training time. This work underscores the significance of distributed and explainable approaches in FER, ensuring scalable, accurate, and transparent emotion recognition systems for diverse applications.

AB  - Brain tumor detection from MRI scans significantly benefits from advanced deep learning techniques; however, conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) often lack interpretability, limiting clinical trust. This research proposes an explainable hybrid framework integrating CNNbased feature extraction using ResNet50 with Random Forest (RF) classification, augmented by Grad-CAM++ for enhanced transparency. Evaluations performed on the BraTS 2020 dataset (2,500 MRI images categorized into glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors, and healthy tissues) demonstrated the superior performance of the CNN-RF hybrid model, achieving an accuracy of 97.2%, precision of 96.8%, recall of 96.4%, and $F 1$-score of 96.6%. These results significantly outperformed traditional models such as VGG16 (accuracy: 92.4%), EfficientNet-B0 (accuracy: 94.5%), and CNN-only ResNet50 (accuracy: 95.8%). Additionally, ROCAUC analysis validated exceptional discriminatory power with an AUC score of 98.5%, highlighting the robust diagnostic potential of the hybrid model. The incorporation of GradCAM++ visualization markedly improved interpretability by effectively identifying clinically relevant tumor features, closely aligning with expert radiologist observations. Confusion matrix and training-validation accuracy analyses further confirmed stable model generalization and minimal misclassification. Overall, the developed CNN-RF framework combines high diagnostic accuracy with critical interpretability, promoting clinical acceptance and offering substantial potential for enhancing diagnostic decision-making in medical imaging practice.

AB  - Interpretable deep-learning models have received widespread attention in the field of image recognition. However, owing to the coexistence of medical-image categories and the challenge of identifying subtle decision-making regions, many proposed interpretable deep-learning models suffer from insufficient accuracy and interpretability in diagnosing images of medical diseases. Therefore, this study proposed a feature-driven inference network (FeaInfNet) that incorporates a feature-based network reasoning structure. Specifically, local feature masks (LFM) were developed to extract feature vectors, thereby providing global information for these vectors and enhancing the expressive ability of FeaInfNet. Second, FeaInfNet compares the similarity of the feature vector corresponding to each subregion image patch with the disease and normal prototype templates that may appear in the region. It then combines the comparison of each subregion when making the final diagnosis. This strategy simulates the diagnosis process of doctors, making the model interpretable during the reasoning process, while avoiding misleading results caused by the participation of normal areas during reasoning. Finally, we proposed adaptive dynamic masks (Adaptive-DM) to interpret feature vectors and prototypes into human-understandable image patches to provide an accurate visual interpretation. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available medical datasets, including RSNA, iChallenge-PM, COVID-19, ChinaCXRSet, MontgomerySet, and CBIS-DDSM, demonstrated that our method achieves state-of-the-art classification accuracy and interpretability compared with baseline methods in the diagnosis of medical images. Additional ablation studies were performed to verify the effectiveness of each component.

AB  - This article presents a novel wireless silent speech interface (SSI) integrating multichannel textile-based electromyography (EMG) electrodes into headphone earmuff for real-time, hands-free communication. Unlike conventional patch-based EMG systems, which require large-area electrodes on the face or neck, our approach ensures comfort, discretion, and wearability while maintaining robust silent speech decoding. The system utilizes four graphene/PEDOT:PSS-coated textile electrodes to capture speech-related neuromuscular activity, with signals processed via a compact ESP32-S3-based wireless readout module. To address the challenge of variable skin-electrode coupling, we propose a 1-D SE-ResNet architecture incorporating squeeze-and-excitation (SE) blocks to dynamically adjust per-channel attention weights, enhancing robustness against motion-induced impedance variations. The proposed system achieves 96% accuracy on ten commonly used voice-free control words, outperforming conventional single-channel and nonadaptive baselines. Experimental validation, including explainable AI (XAI)-based attention analysis and t-SNE feature visualization, confirms the adaptive channel selection capability and effective feature extraction of the model. This work advances wearable EMG-based SSIs, demonstrating a scalable, low-power, and user-friendly platform for silent communication, assistive technologies, and human–computer interaction.

AB  - Pancreatic cancer (PC), known for its alarmingly high untreated fatality rate, is a crucial area of concentration for AI-powered healthcare research. In order to increase diagnosis accuracy, this study investigates the revolutionary potential of artificial intelligence and health informatics. This study prioritizes both diagnostic accuracy and model interpretability for practical clinical usage by combining machine learning models with multi-source clinical data in a new way to maximize early PC diagnosis. Through the use of Deep Learning and Machine Learning, more especially Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures, the authors’ goal is to enhance the analysis of genetic profiles, electronic health data, and complicated medical imagery. AI systems are better at identifying early-stage indications that humans frequently overlook, that improves the chances for early intervention. These approaches improve diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, drastically decrease false positives, and boost confidence in identifying high-risk indicators. The results demonstrate how AI has the ability to significantly improve therapeutic and diagnostic accuracy while also speeding up diagnosis. These developments might significantly reduce death rates. In order to further maximize these AI models’ effectiveness in the fight against PC.

AB  - Explainable artificial intelligence improves the interpretability of machine learning models, which is essential for reliable decision-making in healthcare. Integrating information-theoretic (IT) approaches into feature selection (FS) facilitates a more rational assessment of feature importance (FI) by capturing redundant and synergistic contributions. This study proposes a novel combined FI-FS method that extends the High-order Interactions Feature Importance (Hi-Fi) framework by replacing variance-based with IT metrics for improved quantification of high-order feature interactions. The method adapts the Leave One Covariate Out metric to identify feature subsets that maximise or minimise Conditional Mutual Information (CMI), prioritising features that increase synergy and reduce redundancy. Feature interpretation is further supported by analysing how selected variables interact, revealing both individual and joint predictive relevance. The proposed framework is applied to cardiovascular time series from 127 young, healthy individuals recorded at rest and under stress conditions (postural and mental stress). The analysed features are extracted from beat-to-beat electrocardiographic RR intervals, pulse-pulse intervals (PP), and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP) time series and are computed in the time, frequency, and information domains. FI results show that features reflecting variability, spectral content, and entropy, especially from RR, DBP, and PP, are more informative than static measures. RR features consistently show the highest unique information, while PP contributes mainly through synergy. The FS process reduces feature count by ∼20%, and a Support Vector Machine trained on the selected features achieves ∼80% accuracy in multi-class stress classification. Overall, this IT-based Hi-Fi framework captures individual informativeness and complex signal interactions, improving dependency detection, interpretability, and physiological insight.

AB  - The level of triglycerides in the blood is a key indicator of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, kidney disease, thyroid disorders, and liver disease. This study explores advanced regression analysis and feature selection techniques to improve the assessment of triglyceride levels. Extreme dimensionality reduction methods, including Principal Component Analysis and Independent Component Analysis, along with Lasso regression for feature extraction, were employed to improve feature characterization and eliminate noise. Several machine learning models—CatBoost, XGBoost, Random Forest, and LightGBM—were evaluated using R2, RMSE, and MAE as performance metrics. Among them, CatBoost demonstrated superior performance due to its ability to capture nonlinearity and complex interactions. The study also highlights the impact of feature engineering, with Principal Component Analysis and Lasso improving model efficiency by reducing redundant features. In addition, ensemble techniques such as stacking and bagging improved model stability and predictive accuracy. Explainability methods, including SHAP and LIME, were used to identify key characteristics that influence triglyceride levels, providing valuable information on prediction characteristics. These findings emphasize the importance of robust models, effective feature selection and interpretability techniques in achieving reliable triglyceride level predictions, which ultimately supports clinical decision-making in healthcare.

AB  - Medical supply chains face critical challenges in balancing transparent data access with privacy protection while maintaining environmental sustainability. Organizations must share crucial information like production specifications and environmental monitoring data, yet protect sensitive information such as proprietary formulations and patient records. Traditional access control mechanisms use centralized approaches that lack transparency, create single points of failure, and cannot adapt to the complex data sharing requirements of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based Internet of Things (IoT) (AIoT) -enhanced green medical supply chains. To address these challenges, we propose green blockchain hierarchical AIoT-enhanced medical supply chain (G-BHAIMS), a novel framework that enables secure, energy-efficient data access control. G-BHAIMS employs a multi-chain architecture that segregates sensitive medical data storage from access control operations, while integrating environmental monitoring through AIoT devices. Our framework introduces a hierarchical access control model with data classification based on sensitivity levels and ecological impact factors, implemented through energy-efficient smart contracts. Experimental results demonstrate that G-BHAIMS achieves a 98.5% correct access decision rate, outperforming the best baseline method by 2.5 percentage points. The framework maintains an average execution time of 22ms (21.4% faster than comparable systems) and throughput above 95 TPS under heavy loads. Most significantly, G-BHAIMS reduces energy consumption by 17.8% and decreases carbon emissions by 16.1% compared to the best alternative approach, aligning security requirements with green supply chain principles.

AB  - This research work introduces a voting ensemble of AdaBoost, CatBoost, and XGBoost classifiers with feature selection using Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) to improve breast cancer diagnosis. The model employs such modern concepts in artificial neural networks to outperform conventional and single-algorithm methods in breast cancer prediction. The model trained with the medical and demographic data identified by EHRs had even higher accuracy rate of 94.24% compared to earlier models which ranged from 74.14%, to 86.6%. Due to the involvement of GWO in feature selection, the most relevant features were found to construct the model, improving its performance and enhancing the interpretability of the model as well. Due to the high model accuracy and application speed, there is a prospect of its utilization in clinical work. The results of the research create a possibility to enhance an overall number of calculations with the help of several progressive algorithms and thus, to increase the efficiency of examination and possible treatments of breast cancer. As suggested in the present study, future research in developing and validating the translation process of the model will require independent, bigger, and less homogeneous samples to test its generalizability for clinical practice.

This approach leverages Deep Feature Synthesis (DFS) for automated feature generation. It utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform textual data into compact, predictive categorical representations, reducing dimensionality while preserving semantic relevance. Robust preprocessing techniques—such as data type adjustments, imputation, encoding, and normalization—enhance data quality, while Bayesian Optimization facilitates efficient hyperparameter tuning. In addition, integrating LIME provides transparent insights into model predictions and feature selection processes, thereby fostering trust in decision-making. Evaluations on diverse datasets from healthcare, education, telecommunications, and finance demonstrate significant performance improvements, with key metrics increasing by over 10%. This pipeline effectively addresses the challenges of integrating textual data into structured formats and optimizing model parameters, supporting more effective data-driven decision-making.

AB  - Recently, there has been a growing concern with food labeling, ingredient safety, and transparency on a global level. Consumers want to learn about allergens, additives, and nutrients, but complexity in interpretation has challenged them. The study investigates and evaluates food labels while integrating ingredient entry, public transparency, and label analysis through the processes of assessing, labeling, and interpreting. The application of OCR technology on food images from multiple brands extracts ingredient lists and nutritional information that indicate allergens and regulated substances. The results suggest lapses in the labeling, ones that are inconsistent with the description of the so-called ‘clean’ allergens, which have completely different public health implications. The proposed study provides a tool for food safety by analyzing the automated software proposed for label analysis to inform policies and guide consumer decisions.

AB  - Pneumonia remains one of the leading causes of death throughout the world, especially in less developed nations where diagnostic centers of healthcare are simply not available. Traditional methods for diagnosis are timeconsuming and dependent upon skilled radiologists, yet diagnosis at an early stage decreases mortality and saves lives. Deep learning using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) has recently shown to be highly accurate in classifying medical images. Comparative performance of EfficientNet models B0B7 in classifying pneumonia using chest X-ray images is assessed in this study. The dataset in this study includes $\mathbf{5, 8 6 3}$ images labeled as NORMAL and PNEUMONIA. Optimal hyperparameters transfer learning was implemented to train all the models to perform with high accuracy for classification. Results indicate EfficientNet B1 had 96.17% accuracy, 95.14% F1-score, and 97.41 % recall with highest sensitivity for detecting pneumonia cases. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis also demonstrates the models' stability, as all AUCs are greater than 0.98. The findings suggest deep learning models, as in this research, EfficientNet models can provide accurate computer-aided diagnostic support for the detection of pneumonia. Some of the areas of future research involve enhancing model interpretability, expanding the data sets to represent diverse populations, and deploying AI diagnostic tools in clinical environments. Application of such models in resource-poor environments has the potential to make a significant difference in early pneumonia detection, decreasing world disease and death burdens.

AB  - Cardio vascular diseases remain one of the major reasons for global morbidity and mortality, thus requiring immediate risk identification and preemptive healthcare measures. A cloud computing framework based on supervised machine learning algorithms serves as the proposal to predict cardiovascular risks at an early stage. Through a cloud system that stores and analyzes patient data from EHRs and real-time sources the system provides secure and scaleable infrastructure for efficient processing and data analysis. Supervised learning models, including logistic regression and decision trees, together with support vector machines and random forests with gradient boosting, are evaluated in the study for patient risk identification, which depends on clinical data and demographic and lifestyle information. Feature selection methods enhance both interpretability and decrease feature dimensions in models. The measurements used to evaluate models include precision, accuracy as well as recall and F1-score and AUC-ROC. Ensemble prediction models provide superior outcomes to conventional approaches as proven through experimental tests which produce high prediction accuracy. Deployment through the cloud platform enables both remote access to and instant inference capabilities and the integration with medical information platforms. Early cardiovascular risk assessment becomes possible using this method because it supplies both affordability and scalability combined with precision thus enabling medical professionals to deliver timely treatment with customized plans. The proposed predictive model shows immense capability to change preventive cardiology services by using data-driven intelligent healthcare methods in current medical settings.

AB  - Lung diseases, such as asthma, pneumonia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pose considerable global health issues, making early diagnosis essential for effective treatment. Traditional diagnostic techniques for these ailments, especially auscultation using a stethoscope, are subjective and susceptible to inaccuracies. This study introduces CALMNet, a deep learning model that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and a TimeDistributed layer to accurately analyze lung sounds by considering both their spatial and time-related features. The model is trained and assessed utilizing the ICBHI dataset, which encompasses a varied collection of lung sounds from patients with various respiratory ailments. Preprocessing techniques, including double denoising (FFT and high-pass filtering), were utilized to enhance the audio data quality, while feature extraction methods such as Mel Spectrograms, Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), and Chroma Short-Time Fourier Transform (ChromaSTFT) were employed to capture the fundamental characteristics of lung sounds. The results show that CALMNet achieves an impressive accuracy of 97.65%, with an F1-score of 0.909, precision of 0.911, and recall of 0.90, outperforming other models like CNNs and LSTMs. CALMNet exhibits enhanced efficacy in differentiating various lung illnesses, as evidenced by the confusion matrix and ROC curve analysis. The model’s exceptional accuracy and strong performance indicate its promise as an effective instrument for the automated classification of lung illnesses, providing a dependable, objective, and scalable option for clinical use. Future endeavors will concentrate on augmenting the dataset, enhancing model interpretability, and executing real-time diagnostic applications to further elevate its applicability in healthcare environments.

AB  - The rapid proliferation of misinformation across online platforms poses a challenge that calls for advanced real-time detection and verification mechanisms. Most existing methods depend on some form of user inspection or centralized system which tends to be slow, biased, and subjective. In this paper, we address these gaps by integrating Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), and blockchain technology in a single novel framework. The system functions through three primary processes: event detection, trust evaluation, and validation through blockchain. In the primary step, NLP models examine data streams like news articles, tweets, and forum posts to capture major events across diverse areas including politics, finance, healthcare, and natural disasters. The second step applies ML algorithms to evaluate the identified events based on source credibility, narrative reliability, and factual consistency analysis. In the last stage, the verification process is facilitated through the use of blockchain technology which assures transparency, immutability, decentralization, and security by recording verified events alongside their trust scores on a blockchain ledger. This multi-disciplinary approach not only enhances accuracy and boosts accountability but also streamlines real-time processing while tackling the challenges of trusted event detection and verification. By applying NLP, ML, and blockchain, this paper proposes a new paradigm of trust enhancement for digital information.

AB  - A prevalent health issue that necessitates prompt and precise diagnosis-often with X-ray imaging-is bone fractures. Conventional fracture identification techniques depend on radiologists' manual analysis, which can be laborious and error-prone, especially for tiny or complicated fractures. For automatic and extremely accurate fracture diagnosis in X-ray pictures, this study Convolutional neural networks and other deep learning models are combined in this hybrid model. (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) with an attention mechanism. While the ViT provides global context by recording dependencies over the entire image, the CNN component is utilized for efficient feature extraction, concentrating on local patterns like edges and textures. By focusing on possible fracture sites, the attention mechanism improves the model's interpretability and spatial localization even more. Our domain-agnostic model was trained and validated using a high degree of data augmentation on a number of popular X-ray datasets, including the MURA and Bone X-ray datasets, for the purpose of attain robustness. The hybrid model enhances accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC scores in comparison to traditional CNN-only techniques. Furthermore, attention heatmaps and Grad-CAM enhance visualization, which helps doctors comprehend how the system works. This study demonstrates how attention-mechanism-based hybrid CNN-ViT architectures can enhance automatic fracture detection systems, improving clinical radiology diagnostics' precision and efficiency.

AB  - Existing deep learning methods have achieved remarkable results in diagnosing retinal diseases, showcasing the potential of advanced AI in ophthalmology. However, the black-box nature of these methods obscures the decision-making process, compromising their trustworthiness and acceptability. Inspired by the concept-based approaches and recognizing the intrinsic correlation between retinal lesions and diseases, we regard retinal lesions as concepts and propose an inherently interpretable framework designed to enhance both the performance and explainability of diagnostic models. Leveraging the transformer architecture, known for its proficiency in capturing long-range dependencies, our model can effectively identify lesion features. By integrating with image-level annotations, it achieves the alignment of lesion concepts with human cognition under the guidance of a retinal foundation model. Furthermore, to attain interpretability without losing lesion-specific information, our method employs a classifier built on a cross-attention mechanism for disease diagnosis and explanation, where explanations are grounded in the contributions of human-understandable lesion concepts and their visual localization. Notably, due to the structure and inherent interpretability of our model, clinicians can implement concept-level interventions to correct the diagnostic errors by simply adjusting erroneous lesion predictions. Experiments conducted on four fundus image datasets demonstrate that our method achieves favorable performance against state-of-the-art methods while providing faithful explanations and enabling concept-level interventions.

AB  - Fall detection is a critical issue in elderly care, as falls can lead to severe injuries and even fatalities. Early and accurate detection of falls is crucial to mitigate harm and reduce healthcare costs. Recent advances in deep learning have shown promise in enhancing fall detection systems by leveraging complex patterns in wearable sensor data. This paper proposes a novel model combining a multi-input convolutional neural network (MICNN), bidirectional long short-term memory (BiL-STM), and additive attention mechanism. The MICNN extracts detailed features from multiple sensors, such as accelerometers and gyroscopes, while the BiLSTM captures temporal dependencies in the data. The additive attention mechanism improves interpretability by emphasizing sensor signals that are most relevant to fall events. Moreover, the additive attentionbased MICNN-BiLSTM model demonstrates reduced validation times, enhancing its suitability for real-time applications. We evaluated the model on two benchmark datasets, KFall, and MobiAct achieving 99.30% and 98.85% accuracy, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) presents a significant challenge, necessitating ongoing research and preventive measures. The intricate landscape of lipid metabolism plays a crucial role in SIDS, with disruptions in key lipid components like Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFA), alongside other lipids such as triglycerides (TG) and phospholipids (PL), being significant. In this context, SCFA are essential products of the fermentation process by gut microbiota, hold particular interest. SCFA are integral to energy regulation and metabolism, influencing overall well-being. Their unique characteristics, such as chain length and saturation level, provide insights into their potential effects. Alterations in SCFA metabolism can disrupt energy balance, adding to the complexity of SIDS. Leveraging machine learning (ML) presents a promising avenue for unraveling the intricate profiles of SCFA and decoding patterns indicative of heightened SIDS risk. Ensuring interpretability in healthcare is essential for building trust and developing effective prevention strategies. This research delves into understanding SIDS, with a specific focus on SCFA and their role in metabolic health. The application of ML, particularly the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Stacking model, demonstrated exceptional accuracy of 94% and 96.15% with a recall of 100% and 92.31%, respectively. The models also demonstrated strong classification capabilities, as indicated by a high True Positive Rate (TPR) in the AUC, a low Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.20, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.04 and Standard deviation (SD) of 0.10, emphasizing the robustness and precision of the approach. These results underscore the potential of ML in the early assessment of SIDS risk, highlighting the critical role of SCFA and advancing the prospects for preventative healthcare.

AB  - New case of lung cancer is among the leading causes of cancer related deaths in the world and therefore early detection improves prognosis. In this paper, the author presents a new deep learning model, which combines CNN and LSTM for better lung cancer detection. The CNN component extracts the spatial features out of individual slices of the CT, while the LSTM extracts temporal dependencies over several consecutive slices to let the model take advantage of both spatial and temporal patterns. The proposed CNN-LSTM model can reach 92.1% accuracy on LIDC-IDRI dataset, it significantly outperforms the standalone CNN with 87.0% and LSTM with 85.3%. Indeed, the current model achieved high accuracy (90.2%), recall (91.5%), and F1- score (90.8%), which suggests that it is effective in minimizing the number of false negatives and false positives that are critical in clinical diagnosis. It has a high accuracy in distinguish malignant from benign nodule with the AUC of 0.93 as well. The ablative studies supported the joint operations of the CNN and LSTM, and the application of the integrated architectural design was found to show improved performance. Hyperparameter tuning, with the learning rate at 0.001 and the utilizing of 128 LSTM units, brought improvements to learn statistical models. Grad-CAM graphics enhanced interpretability as focal points on the regions associated with malignancy were enlarged. However, problems like high computation time and requirement of large amounts of labeled data still exist even in such a well-developed model. To the present study, this paper provides a theoretical possibility of early and accurate diagnosis of lung cancer to improve the application of AI in healthcare.

AB  - Cervical cancer is main causes of mortality for women worldwide, specifically in countries with lower and middle income. Early detection by predictive modeling is significantly reduce its impact by enabling its timely intervention. This research shows a machine-learning framework that contains behavioral, psychosocial and cognitive attributes to forecast cervical cancer risk using advanced ensemble methods. The dataset contains 72 records with 20 variables features like sexual risk behavior, empowerment, and social support combine with a binary target, which indicates cancer presence. Two modern classifiers HistGradient Boosting Classifier and XGBoost to develop and evaluate predictive models. Both models are train on standardize data and assess on an unseen testing set using precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve. The HistGradient Boosting Classifier achieves an AUC of 0.99, while XGBoost also demonstrate strong performance with a comparable AUC. Visualization using t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) reveals different patterns between cancer and non-cancer groups supports the models capabilities. Results show that gradient-based ensemble methods is highly effective for classifying cervical cancer using non-clinical predictors. The models obtains high precision and recall in detecting positive cases, which is critical in medical diagnostics. This technique shows the feasibility of using behavioral and psychosocial profiling in machine learning structure to support early risk stratification of cervical cancer. Future work will use interpretability tools such as SHAP to identify the most influential features and validate findings on larger and more diverse datasets.

AB  - Detecting early signs of clinical deterioration is vital for ensuring patient safety and enabling timely intervention. This paper introduces a hybrid Early Warning System (EWS) that integrates physiological monitoring with semantic symp-tom reasoning to support clinical decision-making. The system leverages automated machine learning to identify nonlinear patterns in historical vital sign data, while a curated knowledge base links patient-reported symptoms to standardized clinical concepts. A conversational large language model guides user interaction, asking context-aware questions to clarify ambiguous input and improve data completeness. Once both physiological and symptom-based inputs are harmonized, the system generates an interpretable EWS score and suggests potential diagnoses or symptom clusters. This approach enhances predictive accuracy while maintaining transparency and promoting trust among clin-icians. By combining data-driven modeling with semantic reasoning and interactive AI, the proposed framework demonstrates a promising direction for human-centered, next-generation clinical decision support systems.

AB  - Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare are driving research into solutions that can provide personalized guidance. For these solutions to be used as clinical decision support tools, the results provided must be interpretable and consistent with medical knowledge. To this end, this study explores the use of explainable AI to characterize the risk of developing cardiovascular disease in patients diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. A dataset of 9613 records from patients diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was classified into three categories of cardiovascular risk (low, moderate, and high), as estimated by the Framingham Risk Score. Counterfactual explanations were generated with two different methods, MUlti Counterfactuals via Halton sampling (MUCH) and Diverse Counterfactual Explanation (DiCE). An error control mechanism is introduced in the preliminary classification phase to reduce classification errors and obtain meaningful and representative explanations. Furthermore, the concept of counterfactual conformity is introduced as a new way to validate single counterfactual explanations in terms of their conformity, based on proximity with respect to the factual observation and plausibility. The results indicate that explanations generated with MUCH are generally more plausible (lower implausibility) and more distinguishable (higher discriminative power) from the original class than those generated with DiCE, whereas DiCE shows better availability, proximity and sparsity. Furthermore, filtering the counterfactual explanations by eliminating the non-conformal ones results in an additional improvement in quality. The results of this study suggest that combining counterfactual explanations generation with conformity evaluation is worth further validation and expert assessment to enable future development of support tools that provide personalized recommendations for reducing individual risk by targeting specific subsets of biomarkers.

AB  - PPD is a state of mood, behavior, or emotional disturbances caused by the interaction of biological, psychological, social, and behavioral factors that a woman experiences after childbirth. It is still a global public health issue. The Context-Aware Adaptive Meta-Learner (CAML) framework is a cutting-edge prediction model that uses multi-modal data and context detection to properly predict PPD risk. We collected 1,503 data on maternal health, network connections, and activity rhythms from a medical institution using e-survey questionnaires and wearable sensors. LSTM networks for temporal analysis, XGBoost for ranking accuracy, CNN for visual pattern identification, and Gradient Boosting Machines make up the CAML framework. Contextual modules teach social and family activity identification, and an Explainable Meta-Learner based on SHAP and LIME offers PPD risk variables. After k-fold cross-validation, transfer learning, and domain adaptation, this research had 98.7% predicted accuracy. It outperformed state-of-the-art approaches in CAML model predictability and interpretability. According to the study, multi-modal data integration, explainable AI, and context-wise analysis may change maternity care. The CAML framework gives healthcare practitioners clinical and assignable information to customize PPD prevention, mental health therapies, and ALM living experiences to new mothers' fundamentally vulnerable and heterogeneous social and clinical backgrounds.

AB  - The clinical signs of vascular Parkinsonism (VP) and Parkinson's disease (PD) overlap, making an accurate diagnosis more difficult. Machine learning techniques like Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Naive Bayes (NB) have a great potential for enhancing differential diagnosis. Using synthetic data that replicates key biomarkers and motor and non-motor symptoms, this study assesses how successfully NB and SVM diagnose PD and VP. This ensures consistent variation for a thorough investigation. Several preprocessing and feature selection techniques were used to maximize the models' performance. Due primarily to its capacity to manage intricate, non-linear decision boundaries, the results demonstrate that SVM outperforms NB in terms of classification accuracy, precision, and recall. However, NB provides more interpretability and quicker training times, which can be useful in settings with limited resources. Overall, the findings indicate that while NB offers a workable solution for speedier initial screens, SVM is better suited for handling challenging classification tasks in Parkinsonian illnesses.
