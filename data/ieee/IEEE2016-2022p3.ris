AB  - Federated learning is a collaborative/distributed machine learning system which is designed to address the privacy issues in centralized machine learning systems. The transparency and provenance of a machine learning model are important aspects of federated learning systems since they impact peoples’ lives in various domains (e.g., from healthcare to personal finance to employment). However, most of the existing federated learning systems deal with centralized coordinators which are vulnerable to attacks and privacy breaches. Also, they do not provide any standard transparency and provenance mechanisms for the resulting models. In this paper, we propose a blockchain and Model Card-based integrated federated learning system "Bassa-ML" providing enhanced transparency and trust for the models. Model parameter sharing, local model generation, model averaging, and model sharing functions are implemented using smart contracts. The generated models, model training information, and model reports are stored in the blockchain ledger as Model Card Objects. This results in enhanced transparency and auditability to the federated learning process.

AB  - Explainable AI was born as a pathway to allow humans to explore and understand the inner working of complex systems. Though, establishing what is an explanation and objectively evaluating explainability, are not trivial tasks. With this paper, we present a new model-agnostic metric to measure the Degree of Explainability of (correct) information in an objective way, exploiting a specific theoretical model from Ordinary Language Philosophy called the Achinstein’s Theory of Explanations, implemented with an algorithm relying on deep language models for knowledge graph extraction and information retrieval. In order to understand whether this metric is actually behaving as explainability is expected to, we have devised an experiment on two realistic Explainable AI-based systems for healthcare and finance, using famous AI technology including Artificial Neural Networks and TreeSHAP. The results we obtained suggest that our proposed metric for measuring the Degree of Explainability is robust on several scenarios.

AB  - The machinery of life operates on the complex interactions between genes and proteins. Attempts to capture these interactions have culminated into the study of Genetic Networks. Genetic defects lead to erroneous interactions, which in turn lead to diseases. For personalized treatment of these diseases, a careful analysis of Genetic Networks and a patient's genetic data is required. In this work, we co-design a novel probabilistic AI model along with a reconfigurable architecture to enable personalized treatment for cancer patients. This approach enables a cost-effective and scalable solution for widespread use of personalized medicine. Our model offers interpretability and realistic confidences in its predictions, which is essential for medical applications. The resulting personalized inference on a dataset of 3k patients agrees with doctor's treatment choices in 80% of the cases. The other cases are diverging from the universal guideline, enabling individualized treatment options based on genetic data. Our architecture is validated on a hybrid SoC-FPGA platform which performs 25× faster than software, implemented on a 16-core Xeon workstation, while consuming 25× less power.

AB  - Successive subspace learning, a novel green, unsupervised and interpretable machine learning paradigm is widely used in image and point cloud data classification, medical diagnosis, and forgery detection. The multi-stage Saab transform and Channel-wise Saab transform extract low-level to high-level data features for successive subspace learning, but the feature extraction process has some privacy security issues that hinder its further development. Li et al. [1] have proposed corresponding privacy-preserving schemes for the multi-stage Saab transform. However, the above methods would be in the multi-stage Channel-wise Saab transformation has the possibility of failure. Therefore, this paper proposes a noise truncation method based on the differential privacy approach to privacy-protect the Channel-wise Saab transform and designs a green neural network with privacy protection and interpretability using the protected multi-stage Channel-wise Saab transform, Layer-wise relevance propagation method and back propagation algorithm, named SFLW-CNN. Finally, extensive experiments show that the SFLW-CNN method proposed in this paper achieves trade-offs in utility, privacy, and interpretability.

AB  - COVID-19 is breaking out and spreading globally, posing a severe threat to public health and economies worldwide due to its highly transmissible and pathogenic nature. Early, accurate and rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 can effectively stop the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Automatic diagnostic models based on deep learning can detect COVID-19 quickly and accurately. This paper uses a three-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (3D CNN) to build a COVID-19 diagnostic prediction model for COVID-19 detection. All 192 sets of chest Computed Tomography(CT) data collected are used for this study, including 96 sets of confirmed COVID-19 patients and 96 sets of CT scans of normal human lungs. 5-fold cross-validation is used to train and validate the model. 154 data sets are used to train the model, and 38 sets are used for testing. All experimental data are segmented using a pre-trained SP-V-Net to obtain 3D lung masks fed into 3D CNN for training and validation of the prediction model. In addition, to verify the accuracy of the model predictions and provide interpretability for medical diagnosis, we visualize the experimental results using Class Activation Maps(CAM) to localize the predicted disease regions. The results from several experiments show that the accuracy of our prediction model is 0.911, the Area Under Curve (AUC) 0.976, for no-COVID-19(Precision, 0.902, Recall 0.911, F1-Score 0.900), COVID-19 (Precision, 0.932, Recall 0.911, F1-Score 0.902). The experimental results show that our established diagnostic model can help physicians make a rapid and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 in response to the spread of COVID-19.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease is a large worldwide healthcare issue; symptoms often present suddenly with minimal warning. The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a fast, simple and reliable method of evaluating the health of the heart, by measuring electrical activity recorded through electrodes placed on the skin. ECGs often need to be analyzed by a cardiologist, taking time which could be spent on improving patient care and outcomes. Because of this, automatic ECG classification systems using machine learning have been proposed, which can learn complex interactions between ECG features and use this to detect abnormalities. However, algorithms built for this purpose often fail to generalize well to unseen data, reporting initially impressive results which drop dramatically when applied to new environments. Additionally, machine learning algorithms suffer a `black-box' issue, in which it is difficult to determine how a decision has been made. This is vital for applications in healthcare, as clinicians need to be able to verify the process of evaluation in order to trust the algorithm. This paper proposes a method for visualizing model decisions across each class in the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset, using adapted saliency maps averaged across complete classes to determine what patterns are being learned. We do this by building two algorithms based on state-of-the-art models. This paper highlights how these maps can be used to find problems in the model which could be affecting generalizability and model performance. Comparing saliency maps across complete classes gives an overall impression of confounding variables or other biases in the model, unlike what would be highlighted when comparing saliency maps on an ECG-by-ECG basis.

Adoption of internet of things could represent a new competitive advantage for pharma companies exhibiting pharma IoT. This is a conceptual explorative research demonstrates future of Indian pharma, which is in a verge to become self-reliant nation. The use of internet of things, artificial intelligence, big data analytics and tracking of customers carrying internet connected digital devices (TCCICDD) and sensors implanted in wearables would help to locate the customer medical history with health monitoring. This would also alert both the clinical manufacturers and users resulting in designing personalized based better future of Indian pharma industry. Future Pharma would see the business link paraphernalia across development and dispersal by using better, more reliable larger volumes of data to revolutionize manufacturing.

AB  - Identifying intravenous immunoglobulin-resistant patients is essential for the prompt and optimal treatment of Kawasaki disease, suggesting the need for effective risk assessment tools. Data-driven approaches have the potential to identify the high-risk individuals by capturing the complex patterns of real-world data. To enable clinically applicable prediction of intravenous immunoglobulin resistance addressing the incompleteness of clinical data and the lack of interpretability of machine learning models, a multi-stage method is developed by integrating data missing pattern mining and intelligible models. First, co-clustering is adopted to characterize the block-wise data missing patterns by simultaneously grouping the clinical features and patients to enable (a) group-based feature selection and missing data imputation and (b) patient subgroup-specific predictive models considering the availability of data. Second, feature selection is performed using the group Lasso to uncover group-specific risk factors. Third, the Explainable Boosting Machine, which is an interpretable learning method based on generalized additive models, is applied for the prediction of each patient subgroup. The experiments using real-world Electronic Health Records demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework for predictive modeling compared with a set of benchmark methods. This study highlights the integration of co-clustering and supervised learning methods for incomplete clinical data mining, and promotes data-driven approaches to investigate predictors and effective algorithms for decision making in healthcare.

AB  - Current society is facing remarkable changes in last decade directed by several processes: gains in life expectancy leading to ageing population; essential transformation caused by different epidemic situations including the recent COVID-19 pandemic; on-line work and isolation that leads to different levels of mental disorders; stressful working environments and everyday life. All these circumstances generate significant risk factors that drastically influence peoples' bad health status and conditions.On the other hand, in a lot of, even highly developed countries, health and medical support is getting more and more limited and out of normal working conditions due to different reasons.So, a very important question in this highly technologically developed society is if and how information communication technologies, artificial intelligence, and virtual agent technologies can help in changing and improving the current situation.One important scientific and research direction is oriented towards the development of high quality and reliable personalized medical and health services. The development of sophisticated, intelligent virtual agents i.e. a specific kind of medical e-coaching can help people in getting adequate advices and recommendations in order to improve their health conditions and quality of key life indicators.The use of agents in personalized and social medical and health platforms can open new possibilities for producing tailored recommendations during human-intelligent virtual agents' conversation and support. Some opportunities and challenges of human-agent communication are considered in order to increase human living and health conditions. Several paradigmatic cases of intelligent virtual agents are presented and challenges for future development.

AB  - Readmission rates have become one of the indicators used to evaluate health care systems in many countries. It is a huge waste of healthcare and financial resources. Therefore, researchers have been studying how to reduce readmission rates. After an in-depth study, a hybrid Adaboost-RandomForest model approach is proposed to predict the readmission risk of diabetic patients. Fisrtly, RandomUnderSampler technique is used to solve imbalance problem. Then AdaBoost model is trained and its predictions are merged into the original dataset as new features, and the model of RandomForest is trained and tested with the new dataset. The results show that the hybrid model proposed in this paper achieves 0.79, 0.78 and 0.78 in terms of precision, recall and AUC, respectively, outperforming single algorithm models such as Naive Bayes, Tabnet, decision tree and KNN. This paper also uses the interpretability of machine learning to obtain a feature importance analysis graph, explaining the reasons for the formation of decisions. Good results from hybrid models and importance analysis plots can help physicians improve treatment planning and length of hospital stay, which can reduce readmission rates.

AB  - Deep learning (DL) models have achieved paradigm-changing performance in many fields with high dimensional data, such as images, audio, and text. However, the black-box nature of deep neural networks is not only a barrier to adoption in applications such as medical diagnosis, where interpretability is essential, but it also impedes diagnosis of under performing models. The task of diagnosing or explaining DL models requires the computation of additional artifacts, such as activation values and gradients. These artifacts are large in volume, and their computation, storage, and querying raise significant data management challenges. In this paper, we develop a novel data sampling technique that produces approximate but accurate results for these model debugging queries. Our sampling technique utilizes the lower dimension representation learned by the DL model and focuses on model decision boundaries for the data in this lower dimensional space.

AB  - The first step in developing a responsible data science framework is to review the different types of statistical and machine learning models. Various types of models are handled differently, in particular transparent models versus blackbox models. This chapter provides a review of how a well&#x2010;intentioned algorithm to predict an individual's need for healthcare services ended up significantly underpredicting this need among African Americans, whose access to healthcare as a group is already limited. It explores how statistics and data science have led a Jekyll and Hyde existence for more than a century, dating from when modern statistical methods were born, joined at the hip with eugenics. Good and bad are often combined in the same package. Nowadays, automated decision&#x2010;making and lack of transparency are the sources of danger associated with artificial intelligence models. The chapter addresses the distinction between interpretable models and blackbox models that are not interpretable.

AB  - Non-used clinical information has negative implications on healthcare quality. Clinicians pay priority attention to clinical information relevant to their specialties during routine clinical practices but may be insensitive or less concerned about information showing disease risks beyond their specialties, resulting in delayed and missed diagnoses or improper management. In this study, we introduced an electronic health record (EHR)-oriented knowledge graph system to efficiently utilize non-used information buried in EHRs. EHR data were transformed into a semantic patient-centralized information model under the ontology structure of a knowledge graph. The knowledge graph then creates an EHR data trajectory and performs reasoning through semantic rules to identify important clinical findings within EHR data. A graphical reasoning pathway illustrates the reasoning footage and explains the clinical significance for clinicians to better understand the neglected information. An application study was performed to evaluate unconsidered chronic kidney disease (CKD) reminding for non-nephrology clinicians to identify important neglected information. The study covered 71,679 patients in non-nephrology departments. The system identified 2,774 patients meeting CKD diagnosis criteria and 10,377 patients requiring high attention. A follow-up study of 5,439 patients showed that 82.1% of patients who met the diagnosis criteria and 61.4% of patients requiring high attention were confirmed to be CKD positive during follow-up research. The application demonstrated that the proposed approach is feasible and effective in clinical information utilization. Additionally, it's valuable as an explainable artificial intelligence to provide interpretable recommendations for specialist physicians to understand the importance of non-used data and make comprehensive decisions.

AB  - Statistical regression methods can help pharmaceutical organizations improve the quality of their pharmacovigilance by predicting the expected quantity of adverse events during a trial. However, the use of statistical techniques also changes the risk profile of any downstream tasks, due to bias and noise in the model's predictions. That risk profile must be clearly understood, documented, and communicated across many different stakeholders in a highly regulated environment. Aggregated performance metrics such as explained variance or mean average error fail to tell the whole story, making it difficult for subject matter experts to feel confident in deciding to use a model. In this work, we describe guidelines for communicating regression model performance for models deployed in predicting adverse events. First, we describe an interview study in which both data scientists and subject matter experts within a pharmaceutical organization describe their challenges in communicating and understanding regression performance. Based on the responses in this study, we develop guidelines for which visualizations to use to communicate performance, and use a publicly available trial safety database to demonstrate their use.

AB  - Cardiac arrhythmia is a prevalent and significant cause of morbidity and mortality among cardiac ailments. Early diagnosis is crucial in providing intervention for patients suffering from cardiac arrhythmia. Traditionally, diagnosis is performed by examination of the Electrocardiogram (ECG) by a cardiologist. This method of diagnosis is hampered by the lack of accessibility to expert cardiologists. For quite some time, signal processing methods had been used to automate arrhythmia diagnosis. However, these traditional methods require expert knowledge and are unable to model a wide range of arrhythmia. Recently, Deep Learning methods have provided solutions to performing arrhythmia diagnosis at scale. However, the black-box nature of these models prohibit clinical interpretation of cardiac arrhythmia. There is a dire need to correlate the obtained model outputs to the corresponding segments of the ECG. To this end, two methods are proposed to provide interpretability to the models. The first method is a novel application of Gradient-weighted Class Activation Map (Grad-CAM) for visualizing the saliency of the CNN model. In the second approach, saliency is derived by learning the input deletion mask for the LSTM model. The visualizations are provided on a model whose competence is established by comparisons against baselines. The results of model saliency not only provide insight into the prediction capability of the model but also aligns with the medical literature for the classification of cardiac arrhythmia.Clinical relevance— Adapts interpretability modules for deep learning networks in ECG arrhythmia classfication, allowing for better clinical interpretation

AB  - A plethora of machine learning and deep learning methods are used for the assessment of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) from brain structural changes as seen in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with highly satisfactory results. However, these models are black-box and lack an explicit declarative knowledge representation and thus there is a difficulty in generating the underlying explanatory imaging structures. The objective of this study was to investigate the usefulness of rule extraction in the assessment of AD using decision trees (DT) and random forests (RF) algorithms and integrating the extracted rules within an argumentation-based reasoning framework in order to make the results easy to interpret and explain. The DT and RF algorithms were applied on brain MRI images acquired from normal controls (NC) and AD subjects. The KNIME analytics platform was used to compute the DT and the R project was used for the RF. The argumentation model implemented in the Gorgias framework achieved an average accuracy of 91%, exhibiting improved results compared to the models of DT and RF. The overall performance of all models in this study is in agreement with other studies. In addition, the explanations given by our approach for the various possible predictions provide a more useful and complete assessment of the state of the patient/case at hand. This study demonstrated the usefulness of rule extraction in the assessment of AD based on MRI features and the positive results of the use of the argumentation based symbolic reasoning for composing and interpreting the ML results.

AB  - Can we trust decisions made by artificial intelligence (AI)? This is a question that is important not just for computer scientists, but also an increasingly broad spectrum of non-specialist users of AI. AI is already used for decision support in healthcare (e.g. diagnosis), business and commerce (e.g. hiring, loan applications), and so on. There is therefore an urgent need to address the question of quality assurance of AI decision making. Contemporary AI focuses on a connectionist approach with an emphasis on artificial neural networks (NN) that get deeper and deeper for better quantitative regression or classification performance. However, while NN and more generally machine learning (ML) algorithms perform well statistically, results are individually unreliable. When ML fails, it can fail miserably with unclear failure models due to a lack of interpretability of many of the results generated by contemporary AI. This paper addresses this critical and timely issue by proposing a multi-prong framework that brings together elements of good old AI and ensemble decision making for enhanced interpretability, and best practices in software quality assurance, toward ensuring a high standard of quality in AI decision making. The framework is illustrated with use case scenarios drawn from multiple domains to demonstrate its broad applicability.

AB  - As serious public health problems require complex responses, health interventions often involve multiple components implemented by groups including policy experts, social workers, and health practitioners. The success or failure of an intervention depends on many different factors, ranging from available resources to characteristics of the targeted public health issue and community to the complex mechanics relating cause and effects of the actions performed. In this paper, we present a novel formal methodology to evaluate public health interventions, policies, and programs. Our method uses the theory of change (TOC) approach along with logic models that define the intervention under consideration to generate a causal diagram and an ontology-based inference model for causal description. The resulting causal diagram will then be compared to existing knowledge and data to determine whether the intervention is coherent, internally consistent and its goals are achievable in the allotted time with the resources provided. The contextual knowledge and semantics provided by the ontology will generate a more explainable, understandable, and trustworthy approach to compare and assess different interventions based on their shared goals. Depending upon the quality and quantity of data available we perform a mix of qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the interventions. This study uses smoking cessation interventions to showcase the proposed methodology in action.

AB  - A smart city ensures quality maintenance in diverse sectors, namely citizen safety, security, healthcare, transportation, and energy. Besides, data privacy and security have become an uprising concern for Electronic Health Records (EHR) in smart cities. This is because the EHR platforms are constantly getting cyber threats from cybercriminals. On the other hand, health insurance companies offer certain specific policies that require the association of patients' financial data with EHRs. Thus, additional security concern arises as fraudulent entities can alter these insurance policies. An extra challenge is triggered as patients need to validate their identities separately while communicating with different smart healthcare entities. This is because these healthcare facilities and insurance companies ought to ensure authenticity before offering any service for an individual. Hence, we have implemented a blockchain framework to safeguard patients' personal information and insurance policy. In this paper, we propose a solution for the healthcare system that provides data privacy and transparency. Furthermore, in the proposed system, insurance policies are incorporated in blockchain via the Ethereum platform and data privacy is shielded with cryptographic tools.

AB  - Deep learning-based support systems have demonstrated encouraging results in numerous clinical applications involving the processing of time series data. While such systems often are very accurate, they have no inherent mechanism for explaining what influenced the predictions, which is critical for clinical tasks. However, existing explainability techniques lack an important component for trustworthy and reliable decision support, namely a notion of uncertainty. In this paper, we address this lack of uncertainty by proposing a deep ensemble approach where a collection of DNNs are trained independently. A measure of uncertainty in the relevance scores is computed by taking the standard deviation across the relevance scores produced by each model in the ensemble, which in turn is used to make the explanations more reliable. The class activation mapping method is used to assign a relevance score for each time step in the time series. Results demonstrate that the proposed ensemble is more accurate in locating relevant time steps and is more consistent across random initializations, thus making the model more trustworthy. The proposed methodology paves the way for constructing trustworthy and dependable support systems for processing clinical time series for healthcare related tasks.

AB  - Machine translation software has seen rapid progress in recent years due to the advancement of deep Neural Networks. People routinely use machine translation software in their daily lives for tasks such as ordering food in a foreign restaurant, receiving medical diagnosis and treatment from foreign doctors, and reading international political news online. However, due to the complexity and intractability of the underlying Neural Networks, modern machine translation software is still far from robust and can produce poor or incorrect translations; this can lead to misunderstanding, financial loss, threats to personal safety and health, and political conflicts. To address this problem, we introduce referentially transparent inputs (RTIs), a simple, widely applicable methodology for validating machine translation software. A referentially transparent input is a piece of text that should have similar translations when used in different contexts. Our practical implementation, Purity, detects when this property is broken by a translation. To evaluate RTI, we use Purity to test Google Translate and Bing Microsoft Translator with 200 unlabeled sentences, which detected 123 and 142 erroneous translations with high precision (79.3% and 78.3%). The translation errors are diverse, including examples of under-translation, over-translation, word/phrase mistranslation, incorrect modification, and unclear logic.

AB  - With the rapid development of AI techniques, Computer-aided Diagnosis has attracted much attention and has been successfully deployed in many applications of health care and medical diagnosis. For some specific tasks, the learning-based system can compare with or even outperform human experts’ performance. The impressive performance owes to the excellent expressiveness and scalability of the neural networks, although the models’ intuition usually cannot be represented explicitly. Interpretability is, however, very important, even the same as the diagnosis precision, for computer-aided diagnosis. To fill this gap, our approach is intuitive to detect pneumonia interpretably. We first build a large dataset of community-acquired pneumonia consisting of 35389 cases (distinguished from nosocomial pneumonia) based on actual medical records. Second, we train a prediction model with the chest X-ray images in our dataset, capable of precisely detecting pneumonia. Third, we propose an intuitive approach to combine neural networks with an explainable model such as the Bayesian Network. The experiment result shows that our proposal further improves the performance by using multi-source data and provides intuitive explanations for the diagnosis results.

AB  - Because machine learning has been widely used in various domains, interpreting internal mechanisms and predictive results of models is crucial for further applications of complex machine learning models. However, the interpretability of complex machine learning models on biased data remains a difficult problem. When the important explanatory features of concerned data are highly influenced by contaminated distributions, particularly in risk-sensitive fields, such as self-driving vehicles and healthcare, it is crucial to provide a robust interpretation of complex models for users. The interpretation of complex models is often associated with analyzing model features by measuring feature importance. Therefore, this article proposes a novel method derived from high-dimensional model representation (HDMR) to measure feature importance. The proposed method can provide robust estimation when the input features follow contaminated distributions. Moreover, the method is model-agnostic, which can enhance its ability to compare different interpretations due to its generalizability. Experimental evaluations on artificial models and machine learning models show that the proposed method is more robust than the traditional method based on HDMR.

AB  - Promoting healthy lifestyle in an efficient way is a major public health challenge. Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots might substitute at least partly healthcare professionals in this work. Nonetheless, high-quality studies reported alongside high-quality standards are needed to prove their effectiveness and safety. We aimed to test the “Statistical analyzes and methods in the published literature” (SAMPL) guideline and assess the statistical reporting quality of available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on AI chatbots promoting healthy lifestyles. We relied on a systematic literature review published in 2021, to identify relevant RCTs. Only one RCT fulfilled our eligibility criteria. Out of the 12 SAMPL categories six categories comprising 43 guideline items were applicable for this RCT, but only 20 were complied with and 23 were not found at all or only partially in this RCT. Further research is encouraged on how to expand statistical reporting guidelines to AI-specific issues and more attention is recommended from authors on following the reporting standards.

Such an intensive use of data raises however major privacy concerns, especially in the mobile application ecosystem. In this paper, we first show different examples of privacy breaches that can arise in such ecosystem. Those examples show that achieving privacy is challenging and there is no unique technique that one can use; rather one must combine different techniques depending also on the intended use of data. We then outline critical challenges towards achieving comprehensive privacy solutions.

AB  - Many people with hearing loss are unaware of it and do not seek benefit from available interventions such as hearing aids. This is in part due to the limited accessibility to qualified hearing healthcare providers in developing and developed countries alike. Automated audiometry, which has gained in popularity amidst the torrent of advances in telemedicine and mobile health, makes it possible to deliver basic hearing tests to remote or otherwise underserved communities at low cost. While this technology makes it possible to perform hearing assessments outside of a sound booth, many individuals administering the test are non-specialists, and thus, have a limited ability to interpret audiometric measurements and to make tailored recommendations. In this paper, we present the first steps towards the development of a flexible, supervised learning approach for the classification of audiograms in terms of their shape, severity and symmetry. More specifically, we outline our approach to building a set of non-redundant, annotation-ready audiograms from a much larger dataset. In addition, we present a Rapid Audiogram Annotation Environment (RAAE) designed specifically for the collection of audiogram annotations from a large community of expert audiologists. Preliminary results indicate that annotations provided through our environment are consistent leading to low intra-coder variability. Data gathered through the RAAE will form the basis of learning algorithms to help non-experts make better decisions from audiometric data.

AB  - Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial examples where inputs with imperceptible perturbations mislead DNNs to incorrect results. Despite the potential risk they bring, adversarial examples are also valuable for providing insights into the weakness and blind-spots of DNNs. Thus, the interpretability of a DNN in the adversarial setting aims to explain the rationale behind its decision-making process and makes deeper understanding which results in better practical applications. To address this issue, we try to explain adversarial robustness for deep models from a new perspective of neuron sensitivity which is measured by neuron behavior variation intensity against benign and adversarial examples. In this paper, we first draw the close connection between adversarial robustness and neuron sensitivities, as sensitive neurons make the most non-trivial contributions to model predictions in the adversarial setting. Based on that, we further propose to improve adversarial robustness by stabilizing the behaviors of sensitive neurons. Moreover, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art adversarial training methods improve model robustness by reducing neuron sensitivities, which in turn confirms the strong connections between adversarial robustness and neuron sensitivity. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that our algorithm effectively achieves excellent results. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study adversarial robustness using neuron sensitivities.

AB  - The need for explainable AI is becoming increasingly important for critical decision domains such as healthcare for example. In this context, this paper is concerned with explaining the predictions of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with particular focus on multivariate Time Series (TS) problems. The approach is based on heatmaps as a visual means to highlight the significant variables over the temporal sequence. Furthermore, a channel-wise CNN architecture is implemented to allow for considering the TS variables separately. The approach is applied to the problem of predicting the risk of in-hospital mortality. We use a dataset from the MIMIC-III database, which included about 13K ICU records. The experimental results demonstrate rational insights that conform with the common medical knowledge in this regard.

AB  - Reinforcement Learning (RL) systems achieved outstanding performance in different domains such as Atari games, finance, healthcare, and self-driving cars. However, their black-box nature complicates their use, especially in critical applications such as healthcare. To solve this problem, researchers have proposed different approaches to interpret RL models. Some of these methods were adopted from machine learning, while others were designed specifically for RL. The main objective of this paper is to show and explain RL interpretation methods, the metrics used to classify them, and how these metrics were applied to understand the internal details of RL models. We reviewed papers that propose new RL interpretation methods, improve the old ones, or discuss the pros and cons of the existing methods.

AB  - AI has seen wide adoption for automating tasks in several domains. However, AI's use in high-value, sensitive, or safety-critical applications such as self-management for personalized health or personalized nutrition has been challenging. These require that the AI system follows guidelines or well-defined processes set by experts, community, or standards. We characterize these as process knowledge (PK). For example, to diagnose the severity of depression, the AI system should incorporate PK that is part of the clinical decision-making process, such as the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Likewise, a nutritionist's knowledge and dietary guidelines are needed to create food plans for diabetic patients. Furthermore, the BlackBox nature of purely data-reliant statistical AI systems falls short in providing user-understandable explanations, such as what a clinician would need to ensure and document compliance with medical guidelines before relying on a recommendation. Using the examples of mental health and cooking recipes for diabetic patients, we show why, what, and how to incorporate PK along with domain knowledge in machine learning. We discuss methods for infusing PK and present performance evaluation metrics. Support for safety and user-level explainability of the PK-infused learning improves confidence and trust in the AI system.

AB  - Human activity recognition (HAR) using IMU sensors, namely accelerometer and gyroscope, has several applications in smart homes, healthcare and human-machine interface systems. In practice, the IMU-based HAR system is expected to encounter variations in measurement due to sensor degradation, alien environment or sensor noise and will be subjected to unknown activities. In view of practical deployment of the solution, analysis of statistical confidence over the activity class score are important metrics. In this paper, we therefore propose XAI-BayesHAR, an integrated Bayesian framework, that improves the overall activity classification accuracy of IMU-based HAR solutions by recursively tracking the feature embedding vector and its associated uncertainty via Kalman filter. Additionally, XAI-BayesHAR acts as an out of data distribution (OOD) detector using the predictive uncertainty which help to evaluate and detect alien input data distribution. Furthermore, Shapley value-based performance of the proposed framework is also evaluated to understand the importance of the feature embedding vector and accordingly used for model compression.

AB  - Model interpretation is an active research area, aiming to unravel the black box of deep learning models. One common approach, saliency, leverages the gradients of the model to produce a per-input map highlighting the features most important for a correct prediction. However, saliency faces challenges in recurrent models due to the “vanishing saliency” problem: gradients decay significantly towards earlier time steps. We alleviate this problem and improve the quality of saliency maps by augmenting recurrent models with an attention mechanism. We validate our methodology on synthetic data and compare these results to previous work. This synthetic experiment quantitatively validate that our methodology effectively captures the underlying signal of the input data. To show that our work is valid in a real-world setting, we apply it to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data consisting of individuals with and without a diagnosis of schizophrenia. fMRI is notoriously complicated and a perfect candidate to show that our method works even for complex, high-dimensional data. Specifically, we use our methodology to find the relevant temporal information of the subjects and connect our findings to current and past research.

AB  - Machine-learned models are often perceived as “black boxes”: they are given inputs and hopefully produce desired outputs. There are many circumstances, however, where human-interpretability is crucial to understand (i) why a model outputs a certain prediction on a given instance, (ii) which adjustable features of that instance should be modified, and finally (iii) how to alter a prediction when the mutated instance is input back to the model. In this paper, we present a technique that exploits the feedback loop originated from the internals of any ensemble of decision trees to offer recommendations for transforming a k-labelled predicted instance into a k'-labelled one (for any possible pair of class labels k, k'). Our proposed algorithm perturbs individual feature values of an instance, so as to change the original prediction output by the ensemble on the so-transformed instance. This is also achieved under two constraints: the cost- and tolerance of transformation. Finally, we evaluate our approach on four distinct application domains: online advertising, healthcare, spam filtering, and handwritten digit recognition. Experiments confirm that our solution is able to suggest changes to feature values that help interpreting the rationale of model predictions, making it indeed useful in practice especially if implemented efficiently.

AB  - Summary <p>Healthcare cost of chronic disease management can be reduced using several advanced technologies. Wearable technology and mobile applications (apps) are widely available for health monitoring. These technologies are used by doctors, patients, and researchers for checking the health status. These devices can help in the development of telemedicine and telehealth via the use of Internet&#x2010;of&#x2010;Things, blockchain, and Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI has important applications in healthcare management. Diseases such as cardiac disorders, lung and heart problems, stroke and neurological disorders can be easily identified using AI systems. The AI system collects information and transfers them to analyst and help in reducing healthcare risks. Self&#x2010;control and self&#x2010;monitoring devices are useful for the elder people and those who cannot meet doctors frequently. It develops a secure, private, and trustable relationship between patients and healthcare providers. Blockchain technology helps in analysis of big data in healthcare, protect it, and maintain data transparency. Rapid progress of analytics techniques can control healthcare data and improve overall lifestyle.</p>

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases are the first cause of death in Italy. This has been worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic we are living in. Indeed, worldwide citizens are invited to stay at home to reduce the spreading of the virus, in the hospitals the priority is given to patients affected by COVID-19, and often patients affected by other diseases prefer to postpone routine check-ups, thus aggravating their health condition. There is a need for continuous monitoring of patients at risk, while contacts should be avoided. Telehealth systems, together with smart objects, are able to create assisted environments where patients are remotely and continuously monitored by the medical staff. In this paper, we present the overall architecture of a telehealth system, where vital parameters related to cardiovascular diseases such as heart rate, respiration rate, blood oxygen saturation, and color of lips are collected through a contact-less smart object. Based on these parameters, the level of cardiovascular risk is predicted through a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) which provides a highly interpretable model against a lower accuracy [1]. To investigate the extent to which the loss of accuracy can be balanced by the acquired interpretability, in this work, we compare the FIS model with black-box models derived by standard machine learning algorithms. Experiments show that the performance of the FIS model is comparable with those of black-box models. Moreover, the FIS is easy to implement and it is easily explainable, thus it is worth in the medical domain where either patients and medical staff need to understand and trust the prediction made by machines.

AB  - Electronic Health Records (EHR) have become state-of-the-art in healthcare services. It offers more efficient information management, enables robust data manipulation, and is cost-effective compared to the traditional approach. In Malaysia, studies have shown that healthcare workers manually monitor the health of drug addicts during rehabilitation. This causes late intervention issues when patients have withdrawals which can be the cause of death. This paper proposes an EHR framework that automates health monitoring using the Internet of Medical Things devices. This paper also discusses the differences between EHR frameworks, the application of Internet of Medical Things devices, and user requirements from healthcare worker's perspectives; that is the parameters to be monitored (1) oxygen saturation, (2) heart rate, (3) body temperature, and (4) GPS location. The medical industry would profit from this framework because it aligns with the Ministry of Health's present rules and standards. This framework enables total data ownership, which gives patients transparency and reassurance about data security and handling.

AB  - COVID-19 has lately infected a big number of people worldwide. Medical service frameworks are strained as a result of the infection. The emergency unit, which is part of the medical services area, has experienced several challenges as a result of the low data quality offered by existing ICU clinical equipment. The Internet of Things has enhanced the capability for essential information mobility in medical services in the twenty-first century. Nonetheless, many of today's ideal models use IoT innovation to assess patients' well-being. As a result, executives lack understanding regarding the most effective method to apply such innovation to ICU clinical equipment. The IoT Based Paradigm for Medical Equipment Management Systems, a breakthrough IoT-based paradigm for successfully administering clinical hardware in ICUs, is introduced in this study. During the COVID-19 episode, IoT technology is used to boost the data stream between clinical hardware, executive frameworks, and ICUs, enabling the maximum level of openness and reasonableness in clinical equipment redistribution. IoT MEMS conceptual and functional features were painstakingly drawn. Using IoT MEMS expands the capacity and limits of emergency clinics, effectively easing COVID-19. It will also have a substantial impact on the nature of the data and will improve the partners' trust and transparency.

AB  - The recent series of innovations in deep learning (DL) have shown enormous potential to impact individuals and society, both positively and negatively. DL models utilizing massive computing power and enormous datasets have significantly outperformed prior historical benchmarks on increasingly difficult, well-defined research tasks across technology domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, and human-computer interactions. However, DL's black-box nature and over-reliance on massive amounts of data condensed into labels and dense representations pose challenges for interpretability and explainability. Furthermore, DLs have not proven their ability to effectively utilize relevant domain knowledge critical to human understanding. This aspect was missing in early data-focused approaches and necessitated knowledge-infused learning (K-iL) to incorporate computational knowledge. This article demonstrates how knowledge, provided as a knowledge graph, is incorporated into DL using K-iL. Through examples from natural language processing applications in healthcare and education, we discuss the utility of K-iL towards interpretability and explainability.

AB  - As a non-invasive medical imaging scanning device, ultrasound has greatly increased the efficiency and accuracy of medical diagnosis. In recent years, portable ultrasound is being more widely used for its convenience and lower cost. Patients and physicians can receive the scanned images on their mobile phones at any time via a wireless network with low latency. However, it is difficult for portable ultrasound devices to capture images with the same quality as standard hospital ultrasound image acquisition systems. Usually, the images captured by portable ultrasound equipment have considerable noise. This noise undoubtedly affects the diagnosis of the physician. It is imperative to develop methods to remove the noise while preserving important information in the image. For this reason, we propose a novel denoising neural network model, called Feature-guided Denoising Convolutional Neural Network (FDCNN), to remove noise while retaining important feature information. In order to achieve high-quality denoising results, we employ a hierarchical denoising framework driven by a feature masking layer for medical images. Furthermore, we propose a feature extraction algorithm based on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) for medical images. Experimental results show that our medical image feature extraction method outperforms previous methods. Combined with the new denoising neural network architecture, portable ultrasound devices can now achieve better diagnostic performance.

AB  - The incorporation of technology in healthcare and hospital management has given a new perception to the medical procedures, and drug management for patient-centric care. Emerging technologies like blockchain, Internet of Things, and cognitive computing are most adaptable for designing smart healthcare systems. However, due to the diversified tasks involved, a design approach with broader understanding involving multiple factors that represent each area of the healthcare is the need of the hour. Game theory has gained prominence in modeling multi-player problems designated by strategic interdependency. This paper proposes a non-cooperative game strategy between players (stakeholders) to inspect how rationality is exhibited among the players who seamlessly try to get benefitted from the actions of other players. To evaluate the feasibility of the proposed model, a prototype was designed based on Ethereum permissioned blockchain employing Raspberry pi IoT devices and sensor-based cognition. Use of blockchain brings in trust, security and transparency to the system. The simulation results show that the proposed model provides better outcomes in terms of latency ( $\approx 15~\text {min}$ ), throughput and scalability with an increased number of transactions. The comparative analysis elucidates the fact that the proposed method outperforms the existing healthcare systems with a significant improvement of 10-15% in terms of resource utilization and provides faster and accurate patient-centric services.

AB  - Machine learning models especially deep neural network models have shown great potential in making decisions when analyzing clustered or longitudinal data. However, lack of model transparency is a major concern in risk sensitive domains such as social science and medical diagnosis. Despite the early success of explaining machine learning models, there is a lack of explanation methods that can be applied to any predictors on clustered data since most of the existing models assume that all observations are independent of each other. In this paper, we address this deficiency and propose to use a linear mixed model to mimic the local behavior of any complex model on clustered data, which can also improve the fidelity of the explanation method to the complex models. We apply our method to explain several models including a deep neural network model on two tasks including movie recommendation and medical record diagnosis. Experiment results show that our model outperforms the baseline models on several metrics such as fidelity and exactness.

AB  - Medical text classification assigns medical related text into different categories such as topics or disease types. Machine learning based techniques have been widely used to perform such tasks despite the obvious drawback in such “black box” approach, leaving no easy way to fine-tune the resultant model for better performance. We propose a novel constructive heuristic approach to generate a set of regular expressions that can be used as effective text classifiers. The main innovation of our approach is that we develop a novel regular expression based text classifier with both satisfactory classification performance and excellent interpretability. We evaluate our framework on real-world medical data provided by our collaborator, one of the largest online healthcare providers in the market, and observe the high performance and consistency of this approach. Experimental results show that the machine-generated regular expressions can be effectively used in conjunction with machine learning techniques to perform medical text classification tasks. The proposed methodology improves the performance of baseline methods (Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines) by 9% in precision and 4.5% in recall. We also evaluate the performance of modified regular expressions by human experts and demonstrate the potential of practical applications using the proposed method.

AB  - Deep learning models have achieved promising disease prediction performance of the Electronic Health Records (EHR) of patients. However, most models developed under the I.I.D. hypothesis fail to consider the agnostic distribution shifts, diminishing the generalization ability of deep learning models to Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data. In this setting, spurious statistical correlations between procedures and diagnoses that may change in different environments will be exploited, which can cause sub-optimal performances of deep learning models and spurious correlation between historical EHR and future diagnosis. To address this problem, we propose to use a causal representation learning method called Causal Healthcare Embedding (CHE). CHE aims at eliminating the spurious statistical relationship by removing the dependencies between diagnoses and procedures. We introduce the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) to measure the degree of independence between the embedded diagnosis and procedure features. Based on causal view analyses, we perform the sample weighting technique to get rid of such spurious relationship for the stable learning of EHR across different environments. Moreover, our proposed CHE method can be used as a flexible plug-and-play module to enhance existing deep learning models on EHR. Extensive experiments on two public datasets and five state-of-the-art baselines unequivocally show that CHE can improve the prediction accuracy of deep learning models on out-of-distribution data by a large margin. In addition, the interpretability study shows that CHE could successfully leverage causal structures to reflect a more reasonable contribution of historical records for predictions.

AB  - Tabular data with few observations and many features are common in the healthcare domain. With its rule-based approach to data modelling, the Tsetlin Machine has considerable potential to be a valuable tool in healthcare data analysis by providing interpretability to medical personnel. However, the performance of Tsetlin Machine models may be hampered by the presence of noise, which may often be the case with healthcare data due to individual differences across patients. This study shows that intelligent pre-filtering of healthcare measurement data using so-called component-based methods, such as Principal Component Analysis or Partial Least Squares Regression, can be beneficial for the performance of Tsetlin Machines. Modelling four healthcare data sets shows that the Tsetlin Machine achieved better predictive performance on pre-filtered data for data sets with high features-to-observations ratios.

AB  - Neural networks have been successfully applied to a wide range of human motion analysis topics in combination with wearable sensor data. However, their computation process is not readily comprehensible. Alternatively, many of the model interpretation efforts do not provide physiologically-relevant insights, thus still limiting their use in clinical settings. In this work, we take gait modifications under fatigue and cognitive task performance as a use case to present how in-depth investigations of neural networks can be performed using wearable sensor data. We collected walking data from 16 young healthy individuals in unfatigued and fatigued states and under single- (walking only) and dual-task (walking while concurrently performing a cognitive task) conditions using inertial measurement units. Convolutional neural networks were able to identify both fatigue and dual-task gait patterns with high classification accuracy. To interpret the model, the importance of each time step in the input time series was visualized using Layer-wise Relevance Propagation. The visualization revealed highly individualized gait changes among participants, as well as changes at precise time steps of the input signal that allow further investigations to infer potential underlying mechanisms. Our methods enable in-depth analysis of human movement using transparent neural networks with data collected from unobtrusive, mobile wearable sensors.

AB  - The grade groups (GGs) of Gleason scores (Gs) is the most critical indicator in the clinical diagnosis and treatment system of prostate cancer. End-to-end method for stratifying the patient-level pathological appearance of prostate cancer (PCa) in magnetic resonance (MRI) are of high demand for clinical decision. Existing methods typically employ a statistical method for integrating slice-level results to a patient-level result, which ignores the asymmetric use of ground truth (GT) and overall optimization. Therefore, more domain knowledge (e.g., diagnostic logic of radiologists) needs to be incorporated into the design of the framework. The patient-level GT is necessary to be logically assigned to each slice of a MRI to achieve joint optimization between slice-level analysis and patient-level decision-making. In this paper, we propose a framework (PCa-GGNet-v2) that learns from radiologists to capture signs in a separate two-dimensional (2-D) space of MRI and further associate them for the overall decision, where all steps are optimized jointly in an end-to-end trainable way. In the training phase, patient-level prediction is transferred from weak supervision to supervision with GT. An association route records the attentional slice for reweighting loss of MRI slices and interpretability. We evaluate our method in an in-house multi-center dataset (N = 570) and PROSTATEx (N = 204), which yields five-classification accuracy over 80% and AUC of 0.804 at patient-level respectively. Our method reveals the state-of-the-art performance for patient-level multi-classification task to personalized medicine.

AB  - Lack of standardization is highly visible while we use historical data sets or compare our model with others that use IoMT devices from different vendors. The problem also concerns the trust in highly decentralized and anonymous environments where sensitive data are transferred through the Internet and then are analyzed by third-party companies. In our research we propose a standard that has been implemented in the form of framework that allows describing requirements for methods and platforms that collect, manage, share, and perform data analysis form the Internet of Medical Things in order to increase trust. Further, we can distinguish two types of IoMT devices: passive and active. Passive devices measure some parameters of the body and save them in databases. Active devices have the functionality of passive devices and moreover, they can act in a defined way, eg.: inject directly into the patient's body some elements such as a medicament, electric signals to the nervous system, stimulus pacemaker, etc. Nevertheless how to create a safe and transparent environment for using data active sensors, developing safe ML models, performing medical decisions based on the created models and finally deploy this decision to the specified device. While the IoMT devices are used in real-life, professional healthcare the control system should offer tools for backtracking decisions, allowing e.g. to find who made a mistake, or which event caused a particular decision. Our framework provides backtracking in the IoMT environment in which for each medical decision supported by ML models we can prove which sensor sends the data, which data was used to create prediction/recommendation, what prediction was produced, who and when use it, what medical decision was made by who. We propose a vendor transparency framework for each IoMT devices and ML models that will process the medical data in order to increase patient's privacy and prevent for eventual data leaking.

AB  - Owing to the sensitive nature of healthcare data, the aforementioned approach to transferring patient data to central servers creates serious security and privacy issues. In addition, blockchain distributed ledger technology has introduced immutable storage and decentralized data management capability, which handles a large number of distributed nodes of E-Healthcare transactions via a serverless network, but in a limited manner because of blockchain-enabled resources. In this scenario, the medical industries are concerned about constituting an innovation in health information preservation and exchanging service delivery protocols without the connectivity of an untrusted third-party infrastructure. In this study, we proposed a blockchain hyperledger fabric-enabled consortium architecture called BIoMT, which provides security, integrity, transparency, and provenance to health-related transactions and exchanges sensitive clinical information in a serverless peer-to-peer (P2P) secure network environment. A consensus is designed and created to reduce the rate of blockchain resource constraints on the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). The privacy of individual health transactions before sharing is protected using the NuCypher Re-Encryption mechanism, which increases security and provides medical ledger integrity and transparency. Smart contracts are created and deployed to automate device registration, exchange transactions, and ledger preservation in immutable storage (filecoin) after cross verification and validation. The experimental results show that the proposed BIoMT reduces the computational cost by 26.13%, and the robust medical node generation increases to 60.37%. Thus, only 31.79% and 74.21% of IoMT-related information and serverless P2P network usage are maintained and saved, respectively.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) has great potential in diverse real-time mission-critical applications and one such application is telesurgery or robotic surgery. However, some issues like security, throughput, reliability, trust, and transparency are still challenging in an AI-enabled telesurgery system. Motivated from these challenges, in this paper, we propose a blockchain and AI-empowered telesurgery system towards 6G called BATS, which is a self-manageable, secure, transparent, and trustable system with massive Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (mURLLC). BATS uses AI algorithms such as eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to classify the disease with their criticality score ranging from 0 to 1. Moreover, BATS uses UAVs to transport light-weight healthcare items such as medicines and surgical tools in an emergent situation (during surgical procedures) to avoid road-traffic congestions. Results show that the proposed BATS scheme achieves better prediction accuracy, high throughput when the number of users increases, extremely low packet loss ratio, low storage cost, high mining profit, and low bandwidth consumption by the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) compared to the traditional HaBiTs and AaYusH schemes.

AB  - Due to their promising performance in clinical risk prediction with Electronic Health Records (EHRs), deep learning methods have attracted significant interest from healthcare researchers. However, there are 4 challenges: (i) Data insufficiency. Many methods require large amounts of training data to achieve satisfactory results. (ii) Interpretability. Results from many methods are hard to explain to clinicians (e.g., why the models make particular predictions and which events cause clinical outcomes). (iii) Domain knowledge integration. No existing method dynamically exploits complicated medical knowledge (e.g., relations such as cause and is-caused-by between clinical events). (iv) Time interval information. Most existing methods only consider the relative order of visits from EHRs, but ignore the irregular time intervals between neighboring visits. In the study, we propose a new model, Domain Knowledge Guided Recurrent Neural Networks (DG-RNN), by directly introducing domain knowledge from the medical knowledge graph into an RNN architecture, as well as taking the irregular time intervals into account. Experimental results on heart failure risk prediction tasks show that our model not only outperforms state-of-the-art deep-learning based risk prediction models, but also associates individual medical events with heart failure onset, thus paving the way for interpretable accurate clinical risk predictions.

AB  - Though deep learning has shown successful performance in classifying the label and severity stage of certain diseases, most of them give few explanations on how to make predictions. Inspired by Koch's Postulates, the foundation in evidence-based medicine (EBM) to identify the pathogen, we propose to exploit the interpretability of deep learning application in medical diagnosis. By isolating neuron activation patterns from a diabetic retinopathy (DR) detector and visualizing them, we can determine the symptoms that the DR detector identifies as evidence to make prediction. To be specific, we first define novel pathological descriptors using activated neurons of the DR detector to encode both spatial and appearance information of lesions. Then, to visualize the symptom encoded in the descriptor, we propose Patho-GAN, a new network to synthesize medically plausible retinal images. By manipulating these descriptors, we could even arbitrarily control the position, quantity, and categories of generated lesions. We also show that our synthesized images carry the symptoms directly related to diabetic retinopathy diagnosis. Our generated images are both qualitatively and quantitatively superior to the ones by previous methods. Besides, compared to existing methods that take hours to generate an image, our second level speed endows the potential to be an effective solution for data augmentation.

AB  - Existing research reveals that the misclassification rate for imbalanced data depends heavily on the problematic areas due to the existence of small disjoints, class overlap, borderline, and rare data samples. In this study, by stacking zero-order Takagi–Sugeno–Kang (TSK) fuzzy subclassifiers on the minority class and its problematic areas in the deep ensemble, a novel deep-ensemble-level-based TSK fuzzy classifier (IDE-TSK-FC) for imbalanced data classification tasks is presented to achieve both promising classification performance and high interpretability of zero-order TSK fuzzy classifiers. Simultaneously, according to the stacked generalization principle, the proposed classifier lifts up oversampling from the data level to the deep ensemble level with a guarantee of enhanced generalization capability for class imbalance learning. In the structure of IDE-TSK-FC, the first interpretable zero-order TSK fuzzy subclassifier is built on the original training dataset. After that, several successive zero-order TSK fuzzy subclassifiers are stacked layer by layer on the newly identified problematic areas from the original training dataset plus the corresponding interpretable predictions obtained by the averaging strategy on all previous layers. IDE-TSK-FC simply takes the classical  $K$ -nearest neighboring algorithm at each layer to identify its problematic area that consists of the minority samples and its surrounding  $K$  majority neighbors. After randomly neglecting certain input features and randomly selecting the five Gaussian membership functions for all the chosen input features and the augmented feature in the premise of each fuzzy rule, each subclassifier can be quickly obtained by using the least learning machine to determine the consequent part of each fuzzy rule. The experimental results on both the public datasets and a real-world healthcare dataset demonstrate IDE-TSK-FC’s superiority in class imbalanced learning.

AB  - To prevent diseases and reduce medical spending, many countries conduct general health checks while their effectiveness remains controversial. People voluntarily decide whether to participate in general health checks and, if ignored, this generates an endogeneity problem in the estimation of the effect of general health checks. In econometrics and statistics, instrumental variables are used to tackle this problem but classical approaches are oftentimes limited to capturing simple linear associations and overlook more complex nonlinear relationships among variables. To overcome this problem, we propose deep neural networks with two-stage structure that contains uncertainty aware attention. By using the proposed approach, we can fully leverage meaningful relationships among variables and handle the endogeneity problem while maintaining interpretable characteristics of the model. After the bias correction, we show that the effect of health checks on medical expenses turns out to be small. We also explore a pruning approach where the uncertainty of attention is used as a pruning criterion, which is analogous to the statistical significance in classical statistics. We find that the model performance improves without retraining when the proposed pruning is applied.

AB  - Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in various challenging tasks. However, the black-box nature of such networks is not acceptable to critical applications, such as healthcare. In particular, the existence of adversarial examples and their overgeneralization to irrelevant, out-ofdistribution inputs with high confidence makes it difficult, if not impossible, to explain decisions by such networks. In this paper, we analyze the underlying mechanism of generalization of deep neural networks and propose an (n, k) consensus algorithm which is insensitive to adversarial examples and can reliably reject out- of-distribution samples. Furthermore, the consensus algorithm is able to improve classification accuracy by using multiple trained deep neural networks. To handle the complexity of deep neural networks, we cluster linear approximations of individual models and identify highly correlated clusters among different models to capture feature importance robustly, resulting in improved interpretability. Motivated by the importance of building accurate and interpretable prediction models for healthcare, our experimental results on an ICU dataset show the effectiveness of our algorithm in enhancing both the prediction accuracy and the interpretability of deep neural network models on one-year patient mortality prediction. In particular, while the proposed method maintains similar interpretability as conventional shallow models such as logistic regression, it improves the prediction accuracy significantly.

AB  - Datasets from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are increasingly large and complex, creating challenges in their use for predictive modeling. The two major challenges are large-scale and high-dimensionality. One of the common way to address the large-scale challenge is through use of data phenotypes: clinically relevant characteristic groupings that can be expressed as logical queries (e.g., “senior patients with diabetes”). With the increasing use of machine learning across the continuum of care, phenotypes play an important role in modeling for population management, clinical trials, observational and interventional research, and quality measures. Yet, phenotype interpretation can often be difficult and require post-hoc clarifications from experienced clinicians. For example, detailed analysis may be needed to find that all patients in a a phenotype are diabetic seniors with complications from previous surgery. Moreover, the high-dimensionality problem is often addressed either separately or simultaneously with phenotyping by dimension reduction methods that may further hinder interpretability. In this paper, we introduce the notion of interpretable data phenotypes generated by an unsupervised learning technique. Methods are designed to disambiguate relative feature memberships, thus facilitating general clinical validation, and alleviating the problem of high-dimensionality. The empirical study applies the proposed unsupervised interpretable phenotyping method to a real world healthcare dataset (MIMIC), then uses hospital length of stay as a reference prediction task. The results demonstrate that the proposed method produces phenotypes with improved interpretability and without diminishing the quality of prediction results.

AB  - Peritoneal dialysis (PD) removes waste products from blood when the kidney is malfunctioned. Since there is no clear criterion for PD recommendation for patients with kidney disease, existing machine learning models (ML), which rely on credible decision criterion, are ineffective in making PD eligibility decisions, especially when the correlated traits or indicators (patterns) inherent in the PD data are diverse and subtle. Furthermore, the lack of interpretable transparency in traditional ML also weakens the credibility of the decision they produce. Hence, an in-depth knowledge of the patients’ characteristics is needed to render a clearer picture of the decision-making process and model to detect the rare PD eligibility cases. In this paper, we extend our previous work (Attribute-Value-Association Discovery and Disentanglement (ADD)), to an extended ADD for PD data analysis (PD-ADD) to overcome these problems. We show that PD-ADD is able to discover association patterns of patient profiles and symptoms to reveal PD characteristics and detect eligible rare cases. Experimental results show that PDADD is much superior to existing unsupervised clustering (with accuracy of 89.87% vs 73.37% of K-Means). It also enables straightforward interpretation of the underlying relations of patient characteristics in an unsupervised setting.

AB  - Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a worldwide chronic disease that, if it is recognized late, leads a vast majority of patients to suffer premature mortality and quality of life decline due to a progressive loss of kidney function. Data mining classifiers would contribute to an early diagnosis and hence preventing kidney severe damage since subtle patterns in CKD indicators can be discovered. By employing Cross Industry Standard Process of Data Mining (CRISP-DM) methodology along with features importance techniques, this work develops a classifier model that would support healthcare professionals in early diagnosis of CKD patients. By means of a data workflow pipeline, an automated data transformation, modelling and evaluation is applied to the CKD dataset extracted from the University of California Irvine-Machine Learning (UCI-ML) repository. The pipeline developed is used to carry out an exhaustive search of the best data mining classifier and the different parameters of the data preparation's sub-stages like data missing and feature selection. As a result, AdaBoost is selected as the best classifier with a 100% in terms of accuracy, precision, sensivity, specificity, and f1-score; outperforming the classification results obtained by the related works even with unseen data from a test set. Regarding model's interpretability, the application of feature selection reduces from 24 to 12 the group of features to be employed in the classifier model developed, achieving more explainable model's outputs. Furthermore, an analysis of the importance of features selected is carried out to explore the relevance of each selected feature.

AB  - Blockchain and Deep Learning (DL) are two of the most revolutionary concepts in the field of Computer Science. Both have made astounding leaps in research and application areas such as Finance, Healthcare, Internet of Things, and many more. Federated Learning (FL) is a type of distributed Deep Learning framework, in which the model is trained locally on each device and the trained gradients are sent to a central server which aggregates them and creates a global model. This helps ensure the data privacy of the user as the data never leaves the local device. However, this dependency on the central server can lead to various issues such as lack of transparency and communication bottleneck. Making this process decentralized can help address these issues. In this review, a detailed survey on using blockchain in federated learning is presented. This review also focuses on how can we use blockchain to make federated learning more transparent and decentralized to protect the privacy of the user. We also discuss the major strengths and drawbacks of each approach and further present a few ideas of our own, regarding some of these challenges and ways on how can these be improved. A new scheme to evaluate data using miners as well as methods to reduce storage overhead in decentralized federated learning are discussed in this paper.

AB  - Human-in-the-loop data analysis applications necessitate greater transparency in machine learning models for experts to understand and trust their decisions. To this end, we propose a visual analytics workflow to help data scientists and domain experts explore, diagnose, and understand the decisions made by a binary classifier. The approach leverages “instance-level explanations”, measures of local feature relevance that explain single instances, and uses them to build a set of visual representations that guide the users in their investigation. The workflow is based on three main visual representations and steps: one based on aggregate statistics to see how data distributes across correct / incorrect decisions; one based on explanations to understand which features are used to make these decisions; and one based on raw data, to derive insights on potential root causes for the observed patterns. The workflow is derived from a long-term collaboration with a group of machine learning and healthcare professionals who used our method to make sense of machine learning models they developed. The case study from this collaboration demonstrates that the proposed workflow helps experts derive useful knowledge about the model and the phenomena it describes, thus experts can generate useful hypotheses on how a model can be improved.

AB  - Image classification is used for many tasks such as recognising handwritten digits, identifying the presence of pedestrians for self-driving cars, and even providing medical diagnosis from cell images. The current state-of-the-art solution for image classification, typically, uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs), however, there are limitations in this approach such as the need for manually crafted architectures and low interpretability. A genetic programming solution is proposed in this paper that aims to overcome these limitations, while also taking advantage of useful operators in CNNs such as convolutions and pooling. The new approach is tested on four widely used benchmark image datasets, and the experimental results show that the new method has achieved comparable performance to the state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, the automatically evolved programs are highly interpretable, and visualisations of those programs reveal interesting patterns.

AB  - Early prediction of patients at risk of clinical deterioration can help physicians intervene and alter their clinical course towards better outcomes. In addition to the accuracy requirement, early warning systems must make the predictions early enough to give physicians enough time to intervene. Interpretability is also one of the challenges when building such systems since being able to justify the reasoning behind model decisions is desirable in clinical practice. In this work, we built an interpretable model for the early prediction of various adverse clinical events indicative of clinical deterioration. The model is evaluated on two datasets and four clinical events. The first dataset is collected in a predominantly COVID-19 positive population at Stony Brook Hospital. The second dataset is the MIMIC III dataset. The model was trained to provide early warning scores for ventilation, ICU transfer, and mortality prediction tasks on the Stony Brook Hospital dataset and to predict mortality and the need for vasopressors on the MIMIC III dataset. Our model first separates each feature into multiple ranges and then uses logistic regression with lasso penalization to select the subset of ranges for each feature. The model training is completely automated and doesn't require expert knowledge like other early warning scores. We compare our model to the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) and quick SOFA (qSOFA), commonly used in hospitals. We show that our model outperforms these models in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) while having a similar or better median detection time on all clinical events, even when using fewer features. Unlike MEWS and qSOFA, our model can be entirely automated without requiring any manually recorded features. We also show that discretization improves model performance by comparing our model to a baseline logistic regression model.

AB  - By highlighting important features that contribute to model prediction, visual saliency is used as a natural form to interpret the working mechanism of deep neural networks. Numerous methods have been proposed to achieve better saliency results. However, we find that previous visual saliency methods are not reliable enough to provide meaningful interpretation through a simple sanity check: saliency methods are required to explain the output of non-maximum prediction classes, which are usually not ground-truth classes. For example, let the methods interpret an image of “dog” given a wrong class label “fish” as the query. This procedure can test whether these methods reliably interpret model's predictions based on existing features that appear in the data. Our experiments show that previous methods failed to pass the test by generating similar saliency maps or scattered patterns. This false saliency response can be dangerous in certain scenarios, such as medical diagnosis. We find that these failure cases are mainly due to the attribution vanishing and adversarial noise within these methods. In order to learn reliable visual saliency, we propose a simple method that requires the output of the model to be close to the original output while learning an explanatory saliency mask. To enhance the smoothness of the optimized saliency masks, we then propose a simple Hierarchical Attribution Fusion (HAF) technique. In order to fully evaluate the reliability of visual saliency methods, we propose a new task Disturbed Weakly Supervised Object Localization (D-WSOL) to measure whether these methods can correctly attribute the model's output to existing features. Experiments show that previous methods fail to meet this standard, and our approach helps to improve the reliability by suppressing false saliency responses. After observing a significant layout difference in saliency masks between real and adversarial samples. we propose to train a simple CNN on these learned hierarchical attribution masks to distinguish adversarial samples. Experiments show that our method can improve detection performance over other approaches significantly.

AB  - The world of technology has experienced a paradigm shift in the span of two decades which in turn demands better and more effective measures for data security. Blockchain technology is used for serving this purpose widely. It is a tool which can be used for Peer to Peer (P2P) transactions and exchange assets digitally without the need of a central administration to govern and mediate, i.e. a decentralized system. It works by integrating various technologies like digital signatures, consensus algorithms, hashing etc. All these technologies make it possible to craft a system that provides a way for easy tracking of the previous transactions, adding a feature of security and transparency. Blockchain has revolutionized and transformed the outlook of business functionality in terms of transparency and decentralization. Apart from being the core of crypto-currencies which have impacted the global economy drastically, blockchain can prove to be beneficial in the healthcare sector, bringing reforms in social services, revolutionizing the financial sector, the education system and many more. This study aims to discuss the architecture of Blockchain, the features including privacy, security and transparency, the various domains in the modern world which can make use of blockchain technology to overcome the prevailing challenges.

AB  - Electronic health records (EHRs) contain patients’ heterogeneous data that are collected from medical providers involved in the patient’s care, including medical notes, clinical events, laboratory test results, symptoms, and diagnoses. In the field of modern healthcare, predicting whether patients would experience any risks based on their EHRs has emerged as a promising research area, in which artificial intelligence (AI) plays a key role. To make AI models practically applicable, it is required that the prediction results should be both accurate and interpretable. To achieve this goal, this paper proposed a label-dependent and event-guided risk prediction model (LERP) to predict the presence of multiple disease risks by mainly extracting information from unstructured medical notes. Our model is featured in the following aspects. First, we adopt a label-dependent mechanism that gives greater attention to words from medical notes that are semantically similar to the names of risk labels. Secondly, as the clinical events (e.g., treatments and drugs) can also indicate the health status of patients, our model utilizes the information from events and uses them to generate an event-guided representation of medical notes. Thirdly, both label-dependent and event-guided representations are integrated to make a robust prediction, in which the interpretability is enabled by the attention weights over words from medical notes. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method, we apply it to the MIMIC-III dataset, which contains real-world EHRs collected from hospitals. Our method is evaluated in both quantitative and qualitative ways.

AB  - The advance of digital technologies such as big data, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence ushers in the digital era for modern societies. Digital IT innovation plays an increasingly important role in helping supply chains recover from disruptions due to disastrous events like the COVID-19 outbreak. Nevertheless, there is a lack of systematic literature review on the phenomenon. As such an attempt, this paper explores the role of digital technology innovation in enhancing supply chain resilience and answers this question through a literature review and summarizes six dimensions of supply chain resilience, which provides some theoretical guidance for subsequent studies.

AB  - The auxiliary disease diagnosis based on electronic medical records is of great significance, providing doctors with diagnostic advice and avoiding misdiagnosis. Existing work on disease diagnosis mainly utilizes deep learning models to extract sequence information in electronic medical records, ignoring the interpretability of results and the structural knowledge, especially causal knowledge. In our work, we propose a multiscale label attention network based on abductive causal graph (MSLAN-ACG) to improve model accuracy and interpretability of results. First, we construct multiple encoders in the multiscale label attention network, which can extract n-gram segment information of different lengths for each disease. Meanwhile, to enhance the interpretability of results, we visualize the weight score of different segments for disease results. Second, we propose a disease representation method by defining an abductive causal graph and then using graph convolutional network for knowledge fusion on this graph. The information propagation based on abductive causal graph is consistent with the actual abductive reasoning process from symptoms to diseases, making the model more reasonable. The effectiveness of our model is demonstrated by achieving state-of-the-art results on MIMICIII-50 and ChineseEMR datasets.

AB  - With the exponential rise in government and private health-supported schemes, the number of fraudulent billing cases is also increasing. Detection of fraudulent transactions in healthcare systems is an exigent task due to intricate relationships among dynamic elements, including doctors, patients, and services. Hence, to introduce transparency in health support programs, there is a need to develop intelligent fraud detection models for tracing the loopholes in existing procedures, so that the fraudulent medical billing cases can be accurately identified. Moreover, there is also a need to optimize both the cost burden for the service provider and medical benefits for the client. This paper presents a novel process-based fraud detection methodology to detect insurance claim-related frauds in the healthcare system using sequence mining concepts. Recent literature focuses on the amount-based analysis or medication versus disease sequential analysis rather than detecting frauds using sequence generation of services within each specialty. The proposed methodology generates frequent sequences with different pattern lengths. The confidence values and confidence level are computed for each sequence. The sequence rule engine generates frequent sequences along with confidence values for each hospital’s specialty and compares them with the actual patient values. This identifies anomalies as both sequences would not be compliant with the rule engine’s sequences. The process-based fraud detection methodology is validated using last five years of a local hospital’s transactional data that includes many reported cases of fraudulent activities.

AB  - Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN), despite imitating the human visual system, present no such decision credibility as human observers. This phenomenon, therefore, leads to the limitations of DCNN's applications in the security and trusted computing, such as self-driving cars and medical diagnosis. Focusing on this issue, our work aims to explore the way DCNN makes decisions. In this paper, the major contributions we made are: firstly, provide the hypothesis, “point-wise activation” of convolution function, according to the analysis of DCNN's architectures and training process; secondly, point out the effect of “point-wise activation” on DCNN's uninterpretable classification and pool robustness, and then suggest, in particular, the contradiction between the traditional and DCNN's convolution kernel functions; finally, distinguish decision-making interpretability from semantic interpretability, and indicate that DCNN's decision-making mechanism need to evolve towards the direction of semantics in the future. Besides, the “point-wise activation” hypothesis and conclusions proposed in our paper are supported by extensive experimental results.

AB  - In recent years, convolutional neural network (CNN) has been widely used in security, autonomous driving, and healthcare. Even though CNN has achieved a great performance, the results produced by CNN are difficult to explain and sometimes irresponsible. The black-box nature of CNN makes it lack trust. In this paper, we propose an attention based CNN structure, named IA -CNN, which highly improves the interpretability of the CNN models. Each feature map of the last conv-layer only has one response (one key point) of the target object, which is directly connected to the output. We also combine the attention mechanism to weakly supervise the last conv-layer. In this way, our model can clearly show that which features the model extracted are the keys to the output prediction. Meanwhile, our IA-CNN structure can be used in various classical models with higher performance in the fine-grained classification and comparative performance in the ordinary classification task. Note that our IA-CNN structure is an end-to-end model, the last conv-layer of which can extract key points from images automatically and is connected to the output prediction linearly.

AB  - Acute neurological complications are some of the leading causes of death and disability in the U.S. and the medical professionals that treat patients in this setting are tasked with deciding where (e.g., home or facility), how, and when to discharge these patients. It is important to be able to predict ahead of time these potential patient discharge outcomes and to know what factors influence the development of discharge planning for such adults receiving care for neurological conditions in an acute setting. The goal of this study is to develop predictive models exploring which patient characteristics and clinical variables significantly influence discharge planning with the hope that the models can be used in a suggestive context to help guide healthcare providers in efforts of planning effective, equitable discharge recommendations. Our methodology centers around building and training five different machine learning models followed by testing and tuning those models to find the best-suited predictor with a dataset of 5,245 adult patients with neurological conditions taken from the eICU-CRD database. The results of this study show XGBoost to be the most effective model for predicting between four common discharge outcomes of ‘home’, ‘nursing facility’, ‘rehab’, and ‘death’, with 71% average c-statistic. This research also explores the accuracy, reliability, and interpretability of the best performing model by identifying and analyzing the features that are most impactful to the predictions.

AB  - Quantification of anatomical shape changes currently relies on scalar global indexes which are largely insensitive to regional or asymmetric modifications. Accurate assessment of pathology-driven anatomical remodeling is a crucial step for the diagnosis and treatment of many conditions. Deep learning approaches have recently achieved wide success in the analysis of medical images, but they lack interpretability in the feature extraction and decision processes. In this work, we propose a new interpretable deep learning model for shape analysis. In particular, we exploit deep generative networks to model a population of anatomical segmentations through a hierarchy of conditional latent variables. At the highest level of this hierarchy, a two-dimensional latent space is simultaneously optimised to discriminate distinct clinical conditions, enabling the direct visualisation of the classification space. Moreover, the anatomical variability encoded by this discriminative latent space can be visualised in the segmentation space thanks to the generative properties of the model, making the classification task transparent. This approach yielded high accuracy in the categorisation of healthy and remodelled left ventricles when tested on unseen segmentations from our own multi-centre dataset as well as in an external validation set, and on hippocampi from healthy controls and patients with Alzheimer’s disease when tested on ADNI data. More importantly, it enabled the visualisation in three-dimensions of both global and regional anatomical features which better discriminate between the conditions under exam. The proposed approach scales effectively to large populations, facilitating high-throughput analysis of normal anatomy and pathology in large-scale studies of volumetric imaging.

AB  - Active learning (AL) is a promising ML paradigm that has the potential to parse through large unlabeled data and help reduce annotation cost in domains where labeling data can be prohibitive. Recently proposed neural network based AL methods use different heuristics to accomplish this goal. In this study, we demonstrate that under identical experimental settings, different types of AL algorithms (uncertainty based, diversity based, and committee based) produce an inconsistent gain over random sampling baseline. Through a variety of experiments, controlling for sources of stochasticity, we show that variance in performance metrics achieved by AL algorithms can lead to results that are not consistent with the previously reported results. We also found that under strong regularization, AL methods show marginal or no advantage over the random sampling baseline under a variety of experimental conditions. Finally, we conclude with a set of recommendations on how to assess the results using a new AL algorithm to ensure results are reproducible and robust under changes in experimental conditions. We share our codes to facilitate AL evaluations. We believe our findings and recommendations will help advance reproducible research in AL using neural networks.

AB  - Medical data widely exist in the hospital and personal life, usually across institutions and regions. They have essential diagnostic value and therapeutic significance. The disclosure of patient information causes people’s panic, therefore, medical data security solution is very crucial for intelligent health care. The emergence of federated learning (FL) provides an effective solution, which only transmits model parameters, breaking through the bottleneck of medical data sharing, protecting data security, and avoiding economic losses. Meanwhile, the neural architecture search (NAS) has become a popular method to automatically search the optimal neural architecture for solving complex practical problems. However, few papers have combined the FL and NAS for simultaneous privacy protection and model architecture selection. Convolutional neural network (CNN) has outstanding performance in the image recognition field. Combining CNN and fuzzy rough sets can effectively improve the interpretability of deep neural networks. This article aims to develop a multiobjective convolutional interval type-2 fuzzy rough FL model based on NAS (CIT2FR-FL-NAS) for medical data security with an improved multiobjective evolutionary algorithm. We test the proposed framework on the LC25000 lung and colon histopathological image dataset. Experimental verification demonstrates that the designed multiobjective CIT2FR-FL-NAS framework can achieve high accuracy superior to state-of-the-art models and reduce network complexity under the condition of protecting medical data security.

AB  - Block-chain technology involves a transparent, fraud resistant and decentralised mechanism that helps in enhancing transparency as well as efficiency of operations management in different sectors. In medical sector, adoption of this technology is increasing at a slow pace and bringing significant transformation in ways of providing services to clients or end customers. Block-chain technology is known to have a positive influence on enhancing quality of healthcare services through integration of several advanced protocols and algorithms for effective detection of quality issues in medicine or device supply-chain. Besides that, patient data-protection has always been a challenge that this industry has suffered from and incorporation of block-chain-technologies can help this sector to cope with this problem by enhancing encryption of confidential information of patients. During transmission or storage of patient information, there could be reciprocations or changes in this information that are done for satisfaction of malevolent needs of people. This often causes organisations in this sector to face legal obligations resulting from poor and insecure management of operations. GPOs sometimes face significant challenges in determining if providers of medicines or devices are complying with quality standards as per contracts. However, Block-chain technology has aided in ensuring security and safety of medicines and other medical equipment by allowing tracing at different levels of supply chain. Present study is aimed at analysing impact of incorporating block-chain-technologies in operations-management of medical industry. Use of secondary data-collection and thematic analysis has helped in finding positive relationship between implementation of block-chain technology and improvement in operations management in this industry. A few challenges has also been found for which proper recommendations have been provided to ensure best ways of implementing this technology in medical sector.

AB  - Classification of data plays a key role in the present conditions as most of the real world applications deal with large volumes of data. The problem of classification is defined as assigning a class to each data object in a way that is consistent with some observed data i.e., the Features, which we have about the problem. In reality these Features are of high dimensionality and designing a classifier for such data lead to more computational overhead thereby degrading the performance of the classifier and hence that leads to a problem called Curse of Dimensionality. In order to solve such problem different methods of data reduction have been used and managed to eliminate the redundancy and non-important features present in the data sets. Among them feature selection is a powerful approach of dealing with high dimensional data by selecting relevant features from data set. A rule-based system that is used to solve such problem should be designed such a way that the rules are generated from the Features that are extracted from the large volumes of data. The system can be designed by using a concept called Fuzzy logic. One of the main attractions of a fuzzy rule-based system is its interpretability which stops the increase in the dimensionality of the data. For high-dimensional data, the identification of fuzzy rules is also a big challenge. This work has described a flexible Feature Selection method based on Modulator Learning Algorithm and shows that the Modulator learning algorithm is capable of identifying better-quality feature subsets for most data sets than correlation feature selection (cfs) subset evaluator and a comparative study was carried using K-nearest neighbor, J48 and few existing classifiers of Weka. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by carrying out experimental studies on benchmark datasets from the UCIML repository and one synthetic dataset.

AB  - Every year the healthcare sector suffers from incorrect therapies and an increasing number of patients analysis, which causes congestion in the hospitals and, potentially, worsening of patient's clinical conditions. Extending the concept of the Decision Support System already investigated by the authors, this work advances the state of the art of Reinforcement Learning (RL) via Markov Decision Process formulation, considering an agent acting in his environment motivated by the achievement of the maximum individual objective by appropriate incentives. Transparency, security and privacy of the model are guaranteed by the adoption of Blockchain to enhance the perception of safety around medical operators improving access to hospital services. Experiments focused on the Smart Contract execution time and resources usage have proved the goodness of the proposed model considering both private and public Blockchain configurations.

AB  - Patient similarity measurement is an essential step in discovering clinically meaningful subgroups and building case retrieval systems. Most existing studies implement this procedure using similarity measurement algorithms on the multivariate clinical time-series (input space) or the low-dimensional patient representation (representation space) learned by a representation learning model. However, they either suffer from the adverse effects of irrelevant variables in the data or fail to assess the fine-grained similarity underneath the disease progress. In this paper, we propose a method to measure more fine-grained patient similarity in the state space, where each patient is represented by a series of state representations that reveal the dynamic health status. We discuss three desiderata, including stability, personality, and interpretability, for the state representations, and on this basis, develop a supervised predictive model that learns good state representations for identifying similar patients and predicting patient outcomes. Experimental results on the publicly available dataset MIMIC-III show that our method offers a promising direction for precisely identifying similar patients at the state trajectory level, as well as accurately predicting outcomes.

AB  - Predictive modeling of neuroimaging data (predictive neuroimaging) for evaluating individual differences in various behavioral phenotypes and clinical outcomes is of growing interest. However, the field is experiencing challenges regarding the interpretability of results. Approaches to defining the specific contribution of functional connections, regions, and networks in prediction models are urgently needed, potentially helping to explore underlying mechanisms. In this article, we systematically review methods and applications for interpreting brain signatures derived from predictive neuroimaging, based on a survey of 326 research articles. Strengths, limitations, and suitable conditions for major interpretation strategies are also deliberated. An in-depth discussion of common issues in the existing literature and corresponding recommendations to address these pitfalls are provided. We highly recommend exhaustive validation of the reliability and interpretability of biomarkers across multiple data sets and contexts, which could translate technical advances in neuroimaging into concrete improvements in precision medicine.

AB  - As the aging US population grows, scalable approaches are needed to identify individuals at risk for dementia. Common prediction tools have limited predictive value, involve expensive neuroimaging, or require extensive and repeated cognitive testing. None of these approaches scale to the sizable aging population who do not receive routine clinical assessments. Our study seeks a tractable and widely administrable set of metrics that can accurately predict imminent (i.e., within three years) dementia onset. To this end, we develop and apply a machine learning (ML) model to an aging cohort study with an extensive set of longitudinal clinical variables to highlight at-risk individuals with better accuracy than standard rudimentary approaches. Next, we reduce the burden needed to achieve accurate risk assessments for those deemed at risk by (1) predicting when consecutive clinical visits may be unnecessary, and (2) selecting a subset of highly predictive cognitive tests. Finally, we demonstrate that our method successfully provides individualized prediction explanations that retain non-linear feature effects present in the data. Our final model, which uses only four cognitive tests (less than 20 minutes to administer) collected in a single visit, affords predictive performance comparable to a standard 100-minute neuropsychological battery and personalized risk explanations. Our approach shows the potential for an efficient tool for screening and explaining dementia risk in the general aging population.

AB  - Most existing methods of constructing dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) network obtain the connectivity strength via the sliding window correlation (SWC) method, which estimates the connectivity strength at each time segment, rather than at each time point, and thus is difficult to produce accurate dFC network due to the influence of the window type and window width. Furthermore, the deep learning methods may not capture the discriminative spatio-temporal information that is closely related to disease, thus impacting the performance of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) identification. In this paper, a novel spatio-temporal attention-based bidirectional gated recurrent unit (STA-BiGRU) network is proposed to extract inherent spatio-temporal information from a dynamic adaptive functional connectivity (dAFC) network for MCI diagnosis. Specifically, we adopt a group lasso-based Kalman filter algorithm to obtain the dAFC network with more accurate connectivity strength at each time step. Then a spatial attention module with self-attention and a temporal attention module with multiple temporal attention vectors are incorporated into the BiGRU network to extract more discriminative disease-related spatio-temporal information. Finally, the spatio-temporal regularizations are employed to better guide the attention learning of STA-BiGRU network to enhance the robustness of the deep network. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves mean accuracies of 90.2%, 90.0%, and 81.5%, respectively, for three MCI classification tasks. This study provides a more effective deep spatio-temporal attention-based recurrent network and obtains good performance and interpretability of deep learning for psychiatry diagnosis research.

AB  - Urban living in modern large cities has significant adverse effects on health, increasing the risk of several chronic diseases. We focus on the two leading clusters of chronic diseases, heart disease and diabetes, and develop data-driven methods to predict hospitalizations due to these conditions. We base these predictions on the patients' medical history, recent and more distant, as described in their Electronic Health Records (EHRs). We formulate the prediction problem as a binary classification problem and consider a variety of machine learning methods, including kernelized and sparse Support Vector Machines (SVMs), sparse logistic regression, and random forests. To strike a balance between accuracy and interpretability of the prediction, which is important in a medical setting, we propose two novel methods: K -LRT, a likelihood ratio test-based method, and a Joint Clustering and Classification (JCC) method which identifies hidden patient clusters and adapts classifiers to each cluster. We develop theoretical out-of-sample guarantees for the latter method. We validate our algorithms on large data sets from the Boston Medical Center, the largest safety-net hospital system in New England.

AB  - Remote Health Monitoring (RHM) appears as a promising solution for continuous and better healthcare, especially in the rural areas where the basic medical facilities are scarce or often out of reach. Generally, the main focus is on the monitoring of physiological signals (i.e. ECG, EEG) or activities. However, the overall emotional state of the remotely monitored patients is often underestimated due to the complexity of this task. Consequently, it is crucial to propose RHM -suitable technologies for explainable and reliable emotional state recognition. In this work, a free-position model to detect emotion and facial action units (FAU) is proposed. The proposed method has been validated on the public CK + dataset and shows very promising results in terms of the explainability of the obtained results and performances, which are competitive in comparison with the state-of-the-art (an average accuracy of 93.4 % over all AUs). In addition, the lightweight architecture of the proposed method as well as its low number of parameters, in comparing with other FER models, make it suitable for resource-constrained embedded systems and open the ways for its wide adoption in remote health monitoring applications.

AB  - The scope of AI application is expanding to mission-critical domains such as safety, healthcare and finance. To introduce AI in such domains, understandability of the prediction logic is required. However typical accurate models such as deep neural networks are too complicated to understand. Although there exist methods for generating globally understandable models, their accuracy and applicability are often insufficient. To achieve high accuracy by understandable models for classification and regression tasks, we propose piecewise simple function (PSF) as a general understandable model and a method for training accurate PSF. PSF consists of a few local submodels and can be regarded as a generalization of the piecewise affine model. However, the output of the proposed method is expected to be more accurate since it utilizes information of accurate black-box AI. More concretely, we specify the partition of regions on the basis of information of black-box AI such as important features and thresholds. The proposed method is based on the hypothesis that black-box AI is often overly complicated in some regions and can be replaced with simpler models. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that PSF often achieves almost the same accuracy as original black-box AI.

AB  - Using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic Electronic Health Records (EHR) has attracted increasing attention. However, in existing approaches, the events in EHRs are treated as separate variables which are indiscriminately entered into the model, without taking into account the meaning and grouping of them. Besides, the efficacy of treatment is often neglected. In this paper, we first embed the efficacy information into the disease diagnosis, and then propose Grouped Correlational GAN (GcGAN) to explicitly learn inherent correlations between different groups of variables. We also introduce a dense connection to strengthen the generator capacity in GcGAN. Experimental results on real-world data demonstrate that the generated data from GcGAN are able to simulate real-world data in terms of distribution statistics. The results on multi-label treatment recommendation tasks show that GcGAN can boost the performances by augmenting the training dataset with the generated data and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. It can also automatically distinguish between disease-specific drugs and adjuvant drugs, which enhances the model interpretability.

AB  - The objective of this study is to understand the learned-strategy of neural network-controlled robots in relation to their physical learning environments by visualizing the internal layer of the neural network. During the past few years, neural network-controlled robots that are able to learn in physical environments are becoming more common. While they can autonomously acquire strategy without human supervisions, it is becoming difficult to understand their strategy, especially when the robots, their environments and their tasks are complicated. In the critical fields that involve human safety, as in self-driving vehicles or medical robots, it is important for human to understand the strategies of the robots. In this preliminary study, we propose a hierarchical neural network with a two-dimensional topographical internal representation for training robots in physical environments. The 2D representation can then be visualized and analyzed to allow us to intuitively understand the input-output strategy of the robots in the context of their learning environments. In this paper, we explain about the learning dynamics of the neural network and the visual analysis of some physical experiments.

AB  - Analysis of patients' Electronic Health Records (EHRs) can help guide the prevention of diseases and personalization of treatment. Therefore, it is an important task to predict the disease onset information (referred to as medical codes in this paper) within the upcoming visit based on patients' EHR data. In order to achieve this objective, the real-time nature and high dimensionality of EHR data must be addressed. Moreover, the prediction results of the model must be interpretable. Existing methods mainly use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to model EHR data and adopt attention mechanism to provide interpretability. However, diagnosis and treatment information have usually been regarded as the same kind of information, the difference and relationship between the two parts being ignored. This has led to unclear analysis about the patient's disease development and inaccurate prediction results. To address this limitation, we propose a CrossOver Attention Model (COAM). This model adopts two RNNs to process diagnosis and treatment information, respectively, and then deploys a crossover attention mechanism to improve prediction accuracy by leveraging the correlation between the two parts of information. It can learn effective representations of personal medical diagnosis and treatment, and provide interpretable prediction results. Experiments demonstrate that COAM can significantly improve the accuracy of prediction and provide clinically meaningful explanations.

AB  - In healthcare, training examples are usually hard to obtain (e.g., cases of a rare disease), or the cost of labelling data is high. With a large number of features ($p$) be measured in a relatively small number of samples ($N$), the “big $p$, small $N$” problem is an important subject in healthcare studies, especially on the genomic data. Another major challenge of effectively analyzing medical data is the skewed class distribution caused by the imbalance between different class labels. In addition, feature importance and interpretability play a crucial role in the success of solving medical problems. Therefore, in this paper, we present an interpretable deep embedding model (IDEM) to classify new data having seen only a few training examples with highly skewed class distribution. IDEM model consists of a feature attention layer to learn the informative features, a feature embedding layer to directly deal with both numerical and categorical features, a siamese network with contrastive loss to compare the similarity between learned embeddings of two input samples. Experiments on both synthetic data and real-world medical data demonstrate that our IDEM model has better generalization power than conventional approaches with few and imbalanced training medical samples, and it is able to identify which features contribute to the classifier in distinguishing case and control.

AB  - In this paper, we propose hierarchical Pitman-Yor process mixtures of multivariate Beta distributions and learn this novel clustering method by online variational inference. The flexibility of this mixture model and its non-parametric hierarchical structure help in fitting our data. Also, the model complexity and model parameters are estimated simultaneously. We apply our proposed model to real medical applications. Our motivation is that labelling healthcare data is sensitive and expensive. Also, interpretability and evidence-based decision-making are some basic needs of medicine. These conditions led us to focus on clustering as it doesn’t need labelling. Another driving reason is that the amount of publicly available data in medicine is less compared to other fields due to the confidential regulations. To evaluate our proposed model, we compare its performance with other similar alternatives. The experimental results indicate the potential of our proposed model.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has been causing the need for better lung-analysis tools to detect disease lesions and evaluate severity of lung damage. However, responsible use of AI in a clinical workflow requires healthcare workers review outputs from AI to judiciously agree or disagree with it. For a classification task, we can examine explanation of its prediction by the use of an explainer such as Grad-CAM. In this work, competent, well-known models, along with their ensemble counterparts, were studied to evaluate their prediction performance and explainability. There are three findings that are main contributions of this work: (1) models with higher prediction performance (e.g., better accuracy) could be outperformed in terms of explainability by models with lower prediction performance, (2) two models producing the same COVID-19 classification result might rely on considerably different features, and (3) while ensemble models created by our approach gained significant improvements in some metrics, they could also get performance degradation in others, and their explainability could be better or worse than their underlying single models. This implication suggests that although we tend to select the model that performs best in metrics that matter the most in a target application, in a clinical environment, it may be better if we employ multiple models so that we can assess explanations from them altogether and prevents incorrect decision from human errors. This is essentially important for a positive case detected by AI, as an accurate model may provide poor explanation, and the expert falsely rejects its correct prediction.

AB  - Convolutional neural network (CNN) plays a vital role in numerous classification tasks; however, its lack of interpretability limits its application in medical image diagnosis. To tackle this issue, we propose Attention U-net, an interpretable classification model that can generate high-resolution localization maps for the predicted class. The novelty of our model is to adopt an upsampling-concatenating-convolution structure to create a fine-grained segmentation map and use attention pooling over the prior mask for bridging segmentation with classification. Since the relationship between segmentation and classification is equivalent to the formulation of the multiple instance learning (MIL), the attention pooling can be viewed as a MIL pooling function. In the attention pooling, the attention weights can be seen as a localization map, and thus provide evidence of classification. We integrate our model with grad-CAM (class activation mapping), a widely used method for CNN localization, and we prove that our attention-based localization map is highly correlated to the grad-CAM-integrated localization map. We apply our proposed model to the automatic diagnosis of lung diseases with Chest X-ray. Experimental results show that our model can reach high performance on both classification and interpretability simultaneously.

AB  - Can satisfactory explanations for complex machine learning models be achieved in high-risk automated decision-making? How can such explanations be integrated into a data protection framework safeguarding a right to explanation? This article explores from an interdisciplinary point of view the connection between existing legal requirements for the explainability of AI systems set out in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the current state of the art in the field of explainable AI. It studies the challenges of providing human legible explanations for current and future AI-based decision-making systems in practice, based on two scenarios of automated decision-making in credit scoring risks and medical diagnosis of COVID-19. These scenarios exemplify the trend towards increasingly complex machine learning algorithms in automated decision-making, both in terms of data and models. Current machine learning techniques, in particular those based on deep learning, are unable to make clear causal links between input data and final decisions. This represents a limitation for providing exact, human-legible reasons behind specific decisions, and presents a serious challenge to the provision of satisfactory, fair and transparent explanations. Therefore, the conclusion is that the quality of explanations might not be considered as an adequate safeguard for automated decision-making processes under the GDPR. Accordingly, additional tools should be considered to complement explanations. These could include algorithmic impact assessments, other forms of algorithmic justifications based on broader AI principles, and new technical developments in trustworthy AI. This suggests that eventually all of these approaches would need to be considered as a whole.

AB  - As an ensemble model that consists of many independent decision trees, random forests generate predictions by feeding the input to internal trees and summarizing their outputs. The ensemble nature of the model helps random forests outperform any individual decision tree. However, it also leads to a poor model interpretability, which significantly hinders the model from being used in fields that require transparent and explainable predictions, such as medical diagnosis and financial fraud detection. The interpretation challenges stem from the variety and complexity of the contained decision trees. Each decision tree has its unique structure and properties, such as the features used in the tree and the feature threshold in each tree node. Thus, a data input may lead to a variety of decision paths. To understand how a final prediction is achieved, it is desired to understand and compare all decision paths in the context of all tree structures, which is a huge challenge for any users. In this paper, we propose a visual analytic system aiming at interpreting random forest models and predictions. In addition to providing users with all the tree information, we summarize the decision paths in random forests, which eventually reflects the working mechanism of the model and reduces users' mental burden of interpretation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our system, two usage scenarios and a qualitative user study are conducted.

AB  - Deteriorating conditions in hospital patients are a major factor in clinical patient mortality. Currently, timely detection is based on clinical experience, expertise, and attention. However, healthcare trends towards larger patient cohorts, more data, and the desire for better and more personalized care are pushing the existing, simple scoring systems to their limits. Data-driven approaches can extract decision rules from available medical coding data, which offer good interpretability and thus are key for successful adoption in practice. Before deployment, models need to be scrutinized by domain experts to identify errors and check them against existing medical knowledge. We propose a visual analytics system to support health-care professionals in inspecting and enhancing rule-based classifier through identification of similarities and contradictions, as well as modification of rules. This work was developed iteratively in close collaboration with medical professionals. We discuss how our tool supports the inspection and assessment of rule-based classifiers in the clinical coding domain and propose possible extensions.

AB  - Smart health homes (SHHs) integrate wearable sensors and various interconnected devices using the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. SHHs combine IoT, data communication, and health-related applications to deliver healthcare services at home. The existing regulations and standards for SHH design are insufficient for home health care. Technical and device standards are available for guiding SHH design and implementation, but ethical standards are lacking. We identified six ethical requirements important for SHH: safety/trust, privacy/data security, vulnerable groups, individual autonomy, transparency/explainability/fairness, and social responsibility/ morality. We identified a set of questions useful for software engineering (SE) process for ethically informed software in SHH design and mapped them to the steps of software process. We mapped related guidelines from relevant professional codes of conduct. These questions can guide ethically informed software process of SHH.

AB  - As the global value of gross insurance premiums continues to rise beyond $5 trillion, we know that the majority of these costs are avoidable. The cost prediction of people's medical insurance is a useful method for improving the transparency of health care. We use different regression models to analyze personal health data in order to predict insurance amounts for individuals in this study. The cost of insurance premiums is influenced by a number of factors. Health insurers would benefit from using a Stacking Regression model to predict insurance costs for individuals. According to this perception using recommendation graphs, a person can lower his insurance costs by lowering his BMI, moving to a different area, or switching to a non-smoker.

AB  - The assessment of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) progression via the analysis of physical changes within the brain has attracted great interest from the fields of healthcare, computational medicine, and machine learning alike. Recent studies have demonstrated that using both multi-modal data and multiple AD assessment scores in a predictive model can better reflect pathological characteristics and enhance prediction performance. However, using such high-dimensional structure information to model inter-correlation between multiple targets remains a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a Tensor-based Multi-modal Multi-Target Regression (TMMTR) method for AD detection and prediction, which enables simultaneously modeling multilinear structure information as well as intrinsic inter-target correlations in a general learning framework. We also investigate the tensor-structured sparsity that supports the interpretability of our prediction. Experiments conducted on the ADNI dataset validate the superior performance of our method when compared to other state-of-the-art methods.
