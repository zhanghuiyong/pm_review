AB  - Pediatric appendicitis, an acute inflammatory disease, arises from the obstruction of the appendix, often due to inflammation or a fecalith. This common abdominal emergency in children presents diagnostic challenges due to its varied clinical manifestations, which can lead to misdiagnosis or higher perforation rates stemming from atypical symptoms. This research investigates the use of deep learning, more especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), by utilizing ultrasonic imaging data, which is less expensive, non-invasive, and quicker than the other approaches now in use. Several variants are evaluated including a basic CNN and more advanced hybrid models such as CNN-Support Vector Regression, CNN-Transformer, and Hierarchical Deep CNN, to identify the most optimal model to significantly enhance diagnostic accuracy, for young patients facing this condition. The study's main goal is to develop a highly accurate and dependable diagnostic tool for evaluating the severity of pediatric appendicitis by differentiating between simple and complex cases and identifying whether surgery is required to inform treatment plans. Various challenges that need to be tackled are managing significant dataset imbalances, enhancing interpretability and transparency for real-world clinical settings, and ensuring the robustness and adaptability of all these models across various healthcare environments.

AB  - The increasing global prevalence of monkeypox (mpox) has necessitated the development of accurate, efficient, and interpretable diagnostic models for timely disease identification. Although deep learning has advanced medical image analysis, diagnosing diseases with complex lesions, such as monkeypox, remains challenging in resource-limited settings. Existing methods often rely on large architectures that demand high computational resources and lack interpretability. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight, interpretable architecture that truncates MobileNetV2 for efficient feature extraction, incorporates Ghost Modules to reduce redundancy, and integrates a SA-MobileViT block to capture both local and global dependencies in lesion images. Grad-CAM visualizations enhance interpretability, and Optuna is used for hyperparameter optimization. Our model achieved an accuracy of 98.72%, precision of 98.76%, recall of 98.72%, and F1-score of 98.72%, outperforming existing approaches, especially in handling irregular lesion patterns. The model’s design is ideal for deployment in resource-constrained settings, offering a robust solution for real-world healthcare applications. Grad-CAM, saliency maps, and other visualization techniques help improve clinical trust by highlighting relevant regions in input images, emphasizing key features of the lesions. The proposed model is lightweight with only 630,204 parameters, making it  $92.3\times $  smaller than ResNet152V2 (58,152,004 parameters) and  $28.7\times $  smaller than DenseNet201 (18,100,612 parameters). It requires 321.61M FLOPs,  $35.8\times $  fewer than ResNet152V2 (11.51G FLOPs) and  $13.4\times $  fewer than DenseNet201 (4.29G FLOPs). With a size of just 72.92 MB, it is  $8.14\times $  smaller than ResNet152V2 (594.08 MB) and  $4.57\times $  smaller than DenseNet201 (333.47 MB), making it an efficient solution for mobile and edge deployment in resource-constrained environments.

AB  - Malaria remains a life-threatening disease caused by Plasmodium parasites, necessitating accurate and rapid diagnosis for effective treatment. Conventional diagnostic methods are often prone to human error and limited by data insufficiency, impacting their reliability. This paper introduces MalNet-DAF (Malaria Network with Dual-Attentive Fusion), a novel deep-learning model designed to improve the diagnosis and classification of malaria-infected cells. The proposed architecture integrates stacked Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for spatial feature extraction with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks for modeling temporal dependencies. To enhance interpretability and performance, MalNet-DAF incorporates dynamic attention mechanisms. The Spatial Attention Module (SAM) highlights critical disease-affected regions by refining CNN-extracted features, while the Temporal Attention Module (TAM), applied after Bi-LSTM processing, emphasizes informative time steps by suppressing irrelevant signals. The fused spatial and temporal feature vectors are processed through Dense Layers with ReLU activation and Dropout regularization. The model is trained and validated using a publicly available malaria dataset from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Experimental results show that MalNet-DAF achieves a classification accuracy of 99.24%, outperforming traditional baseline models. These findings demonstrate the potential of dynamic attention-driven deep learning (DL) in supporting real-time clinical decision-making and addressing challenges in healthcare diagnostics.

AB  - Machine Learning (ML) is a relatively recent development that has had a profound impact on Robotics, Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) by allowing automation of intelligent processing, perception and human-computer interaction. ML-driven AI solutions are crucial in these areas for real-time decision-making, pattern recognition, and autonomous operations; traditional rule-based methods tend to lack the adaptability and scalability to meet the demands of these fields. RL and deep learning have increasingly contributed to the improvement of robotic perception, motion planning, and manipulation in robotics, enabling better and more adaptive autonomous systems. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer-based architectures have revolutionized computer vision, with applications ranging from object detection and image segmentation to facial recognition, allowing for advanced visual analysis across sectors such as healthcare, security, and self-driving cars. In NLP, the introduction of transformers like BERT and GPT has transformed the space by enabling more context-aware and human-like AI-driven language models, leading to drastic improvements in areas like speech recognition, sentiment analysis, and machine translation. This study delves into the application of ML techniques across these domains, evaluating the implications on efficiency, accuracy, and scalability along with challenges like data quality, model interpretability, and computational constraints. DQN has made advances for robotics, ViT in the domain of computer vision, and LLMs in the subject of NLU. A comparative study to analyse the progress and limitations of such state-of-the-art ML models. The results highlight the promise of multi-modal AI systems, where machine learning algorithms work in conjunction to improve robotic navigation, as well as visual perception and natural language understanding. Extending prior studies of intelligent automation, this research points the way to the development of new adaptive, human-centric, and autonomous AI innovations in diverse sectors.

AB  - Weakly supervised object detection (WSup-OD) increases the usefulness and interpretability of image classification algorithms without requiring additional supervision. The successes of multiple instance learning in this task for natural images, however, do not translate well to medical images due to the very different characteristics of their objects (i.e. pathologies). In this work, we propose Weakly Supervised ROI Proposal Networks (WSRPN), a new method for generating bounding box proposals on the fly using a specialized region of interest-attention (ROI-attention) module. WSRPN integrates well with classic backbone-head classification algorithms and is end-to-end trainable with only image-label supervision. We experimentally demonstrate that our new method outperforms existing methods in the challenging task of disease localization in chest X-ray images. Code: https://github.com/philip-mueller/wsrpn.

AB  - The dynamic functional brain network (DFBN) inherently captures topological changes in brain connectivity pattern during activity, attracting increasing attention for detecting brain disorders. However, most current DFBN analysis methods rely on data-driven modeling and ignore crucial prior knowledge of brain structure and function, resulting in weak interpretability of models. Furthermore, effectively extracting dynamic topological features from DFBN is still a challenging issue, due to its intricate spatio-temporal features coupling. In this paper, we propose an interpretable spatio-temporal tensor graph convolutional network for DFBN analysis. Firstly, by incorporating functional and structural priors into the construction of DBFN, we develop a hierarchical DBFN representation with brain region clustering that effectively captures the spatio-temporal topology among subnetworks. Secondly, we design a tensor graph convolutional network with both intra-graph propagation and inter-graph propagation to simultaneously extract the spatio-temporal features from the hierarchical DFBN. Additionally, we derive a functional subnetwork constraint to enhance the consistency within subnetworks and the differences between subnetworks, which guides the learned features to better reflect the topology prior of the brain network. Finally, self-attention is employed to fuse the learned dynamic topological features of different subnetworks for classification. Experimental results on epilepsy, ADNI and ABIDE datasets demonstrate that our method achieves competitive diagnostic performance and offers network-level interpretability for brain disease diagnosis.

AB  - The consumer electronics (CE) industry has greatly benefited from cutting-edge technology such as the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence (AI), Big Data analytics, and edge computing. These new emerging technologies have transformed traditional consumer systems for healthcare into smart, cost-effective, user-friendly, and sustainable consumer healthcare services. However, in such heterogeneous healthcare networks, smart devices generate large amounts of data. As a result, protecting CE and ensuring privacy preservation in healthcare systems remains an ongoing challenge. In this article, we explore the role of edge intelligence in protecting CE for healthcare services. We develop a lightweight and robust detection model using knowledge distillation-based federated learning to safeguard edge devices and ensure the privacy-preserving of consumer technology for healthcare services close to the data source. In addition, explainable AI for federated edge intelligence is used to comprehend and trust the prediction result in consumer technology. Finally, challenges, limitations, and future research are discussed.

AB  - Early dementia detection is pivotal for timely clinical interventions that can delay cognitive decline and improve patient quality of life. However, many machine learning models exhibit fragility by depending too heavily on a small subset of features, reducing both robustness and interpretability-particularly when data quality or completeness varies. To address this issue, we introduce a random feature masking strategy that deliberately obscures some inputs during training to encourage broader and more balanced feature usage. This approach improves resilience to missing or degraded data and enhances clinical trustworthiness by producing more interpretable outputs. We demonstrate our method on the Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) dataset using Transformer and Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE) models under two dataset configurations. Evaluations based on Macro F1 and SHAP-based feature importance show that random masking notably improves both robustness and interpretability, reducing dependence on dominant features while maintaining or boosting predictive performance. These results highlight the clinical potential of random feature masking in creating reliable, interpretable models for early dementia detection, pointing toward more trustworthy AI-driven healthcare solutions.CCS Concepts• Computing methodologies → Supervised learning by classification.

AB  - Parkinson’s disease (PD) detection through voice analysis faces two fundamental challenges: traditional machine learning methods lack clinical interpretability due to their correlational nature, while existing causal inference approaches struggle with the high-dimensional, complex relationships inherent in vocal biomarkers. We address these limitations by developing a causal inference framework that establishes interpretable relationships between vocal features and PD diagnosis. Our approach centers on estimating the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) of vocal frequency spread using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and backdoor adjustment, implemented through CatBoost for robust nonlinear modeling. To overcome data scarcity constraints, we introduce a Self-Attentive Quantile GAN (SAQ-GAN) that preserves empirical feature distributions through quantile-based transformation and self-attention mechanisms. The framework includes systematic preprocessing for causal validity and comprehensive refutation tests to validate causal assumptions. Experimental evaluation on the Oxford Parkinson’s dataset demonstrates that our method achieves 95.03% precision and 97.84% AUC-ROC while providing clinically interpretable causal estimates (ATE = 0.1844, 95% CI: [0.0743, 0.2945]). Comparative analysis with state-of-the-art causal methods and extensive ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of combining synthetic data augmentation with principled causal inference for medical diagnosis.

AB  - The past resurgence of Monkeypox draws attention to the need for urgent fast and sensitive diagnostic methods, especially in low resource settings. This work introduces a new approach on classifying Monkeypox lesions using a Fractal Convolutional Neural Network. The recursive multi-path fractal blocks are incorporated into the proposed fractal-CNN architecture to capture complex, multi-scale features that are essential to distinguish such lesions from similar skin conditions like chickenpox and measles. It developed a dataset of 2,056 skin lesion images, both positive and negative for Monkeypox, and preprocessed those using data augmentation techniques for increasing variability. Transfer learning and fine-tuning of hyperparameters for medical images were applied. Experimental results indicate that Fractal-CNN obtains high classification performance with an accuracy of 95.7%, an F1-score of 0.978, and an AUC-ROC of 0.993 better than the baseline models: ResNet50 and MobileNetV2. The model was further optimized to be deployed on a mobile device, achieving an average inference time of 45 ms. This means real-time diagnosis can be made possible in mobile health applications. This project holds promise for the application of Fractal-CNN in public health; scale up, accurate, and accessible screening for Monkeypox could be made available to remote or underserved areas. The future work would include extension of the dataset and addition of techniques for explain ability to enhance interpretability for clinical applications.

AB  - Unreliable predictions limit the usability of AI in pervasive systems, especially in time series forecasting of critical sectors like medicine. Incomplete data and missing measurements degrade model performance and obscure their impact on predictions. Hardware failures and limited resources to collect data at required frequencies exacerbate these challenges. This research proposes XTRTimeS—eXplainable Transformer for Robust Time Series forecasting—an approach that leverages explainability techniques to improve forecasting with incomplete data while providing a confidence evaluation. The evaluation offers users insights into how missing data influence predictions, highlighting both likely and extreme scenarios. Additionally, it can be employed in machine-to-machine interactions, where predictions with low confidence are automatically discarded. By enhancing transparency and robustness, XTRTimeS supports reliable time series predictions, particularly in high-stakes applications such as healthcare and autonomous systems.

AB  - Deep neural networks (DNNs) are currently the dominant technology in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and have shown impressive performance in diverse applications, including autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, text generation, and logical reasoning. However, they lack transparency due to their black-box construction and are vulnerable to environmental and adversarial noise. These issues have caused concerns about their safety and trust when deployed in the real world. Although standard training optimizes the model’s accuracy, it does not take into account desirable safety properties such as robustness, fairness, and monotonicity. As a result, researchers have spent considerable time developing automated methods for building safe and trustworthy DNNs. Abstract interpretation has emerged as the most popular framework for efficiently analyzing realistic DNNs among the various approaches. However, due to fundamental differences in the computational structure of DNNs compared to traditional programs, developing efficient DNN analyzers has required tackling significantly different research challenges than those encountered for programs. In this monograph, state-of-the-art approaches based on abstract interpretation for analyzing DNNs are described. These approaches include the design of new abstract domains, synthesis of novel abstract transformers, abstraction refinement, and incremental analysis. Discussed is how the analysis results can be used to: (i) formally check whether a trained DNN satisfies desired output and gradient-based safety properties, (ii) guide the model updates during training towards satisfying safety properties, and (iii) reliably explain and interpret the black-box workings of DNNs.

AB  - The past has witnessed a time of astounding developments in AI, particularly notable deep convolutional networks, which has greatly facilitated medical imaging by opening up previously unattainable doors for both precision and effectiveness of diagnoses. This study is an investigation into how deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) might be applied (using MRI, CT, and X-ray as examples) to medical imaging for the purposes of improving accuracy, consistency, and practicability of diagnostic procedures. Through automated feature extraction and categorization, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) enable earlier, and more accurate, detection of illnesses such as cancer, cardiovascular disease and neurological problems by detecting minor deviations that humans may miss. Here we evaluate the accuracy, sensitivity, and computing efficiency of several convolutional network (CNN) designs. ResNet and UNet are these architectures. The results indicate that CNN based models provide better performance compared to conventional diagnostic approaches with a substantial diminution in both false positives and false negatives. The article also covers combining CNNs with others AI methods such as transfer learning, ensemble methods, etc. to further improve diagnostic results. Although the encouraging outcomes, data protection, interpretability, and clinical acceptance continue to be obstacles. This study shows how AI driven technology can revolutionize medical imaging to enhance patient outcomes as well as tailored healthcare solutions.

Using a dataset of over 36,000 National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) reports from 2000–2020, BERTopic employed transformer-based embeddings and hierarchical clustering, while PLSA utilized probabilistic modelling through the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Results showed that BERTopic outperformed PLSA in topic coherence, achieving a C_v score of 0.41 compared to PLSA's 0.37, while also demonstrating superior interpretability as validated by aviation safety experts. These findings underscore the advantages of modern transformer-based approaches in analyzing complex aviation datasets, paving the way for enhanced insights and informed decision-making in aviation safety. Future work will explore hybrid models, multilingual datasets, and advanced clustering techniques to further improve topic modelling in this domain.

AB  - In this the paper, we discussed how to maintain an effective hostel management system which is important for providing a well-organized and timely setting for students. An effective hostel management system is important in delivering a well-structured and prompt setting for students. This paper presents a novel framework that utilizes real-time event triggers and priority-based complaint sorting algorithms to enhance administrative efficiency. The system utilizes React Native for cross-platform mobile application development, AWS for scalable backend service, and mongo DB for cloud storage. Using an active complaint workflow handling, auto-sorting, and real-time notification through AWS SES, the proposed system minimizes resolution time significantly and enhances transparency in operations. Experimental outcomes indicate that efficiency in complaint resolution is 40% more compared to traditional practices. The framework offers a modern approach to hostel management through timely issue-solving and improved student satisfaction. The food feedback section allows students to grade food quality 1 to 5 stars and provide optional comments. Aggregated feedback can be retrieved by administrators to assess areas of improvement. Brute-force and man-in-the-middle attacks are prevented by security features that adhere to GDPR and ISO/IEC 27001 standards. Authentication is based on pre-set credentials to ensure enhanced accessibility for students and administrators while providing strong data security procedures.

AB  - The fusion of multi-view medical images through deep neural networks is essential for boosting diagnostic precision in the field of medical image analysis. However, the reliability of these diagnostic results is often compromised by imperfections in image views, manifested as noise, artifacts, and data deficits arising from inconsistent diagnostic frequencies. These issues introduce a significant risk when merging medical views in a clinical setting. To address these problems, we introduce the Reliability-Enhanced Multi-view Network (REMNet), a novel framework designed to tackle two critical challenges: 1) reducing misclassification and uncertainty from imperfect view integration, and 2) improving the reliability and interpretability of multi-view medical image predictions. Specifically, REMNet merges information from multiple views into a coherent evidence framework and incorporates a Dirichlet prior within our predictive model to more accurately estimate confidence in predictions. Coupled with a robust fusion strategy and a precise confidence calibration process, REMNet consolidates the diverse strengths of various medical imaging views, reduces the impact of view imperfections, and enhances the reliability of medical imaging diagnostics. The superiority of REMNet is validated through comprehensive theoretical analysis and empirical experiments on multi-view medical image datasets across different modalities.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered medical diagnosis systems can play a vital role in healthcare by enabling early detection of COVID-19, pneumonia, and tuberculosis. While chest X-ray diagnostics continue to be an essential tool in clinical assessment, timely identification is crucial as it facilitates prompt medical intervention. In this research, we present a novel AI-driven diagnostic system that combines three operational components: applying knowledge distillation methods with semi-supervised segmentation procedures and multi-class classification features to achieve better accuracy rates and operational effectiveness. Our research employed 20,000 four-class chest x-ray images for evaluation following preprocessing operations involving downsampling and augmented techniques. Using semi-supervised segmentation, the UNet model achieved a Dice score of 98% and an IoU of 97%, effectively isolating lung regions to create a refined dataset. We then trained both subsets of the dataset - segmented and original - on CNN models such as InceptionV3,Vgg16, ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, and their Attention enhanced variants, followed by ensembled CNNs and CLIP-ViT-L/14. Of these, the ViT model demonstrated the highest score through training on segmented data at 97% accuracy, establishing it as the most suitable teacher model for knowledge distillation. This led to CLIP-KDViT, which distilled knowledge into the MobileNetV2 student model, achieving 99% accuracy on segmented images and classifying 3,000 unseen test images with 97.2% accuracy and a 2.8% misclassification rate. The optimized pipeline was then integrated into our web application, Respire Check, which incorporates Grad-CAM for explainability, demonstrating the full functionality of our AI-driven X-ray diagnosis system.

AB  - Detecting Ventricular Arrhythmia (VA) is critical for preventing Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD) by identifying life-threatening heart rhythms, such as ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) [1], and enabling timely intervention via implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD). Although deep-learning (DL) methods have improved VA detection by reducing Inappropriate Shock Rates (ISR) and minimizing manual parameter tuning compared to traditional rule-based systems [2], they suffer from a lack of transparency, particularly in uncertainty quantification (UQ), which limits their reliability in critical medical decisions and impedes widespread adoption in trustworthy smart health applications. Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) address this issue by providing UQ through model sampling, allowing for robust diagnostic interventions, such as from medical experts or rule-based systems, when inference confidence is low (Figure 15.3.1). However, BNNs require extensive Gaussian random number generation (GRNG) and memory access, resulting in >6x energy consumption of regular neural networks (NN) (Figure 15.3.1). This energy demand is further exacerbated by multiple sampling iterations (T), which is impractical for battery powered ICDs. To address these challenges, this work presents a 65nm Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network (Bayes-CNN) accelerator for VA detection, which enables fully parallel analog GRNG, in-memory vector-matrix operations, and partial sampling. The proposed design facilitates low-power and UQ-enabled VA detection, ensuring reliable performance under out-of-distribution data, hardware imperfections and temperature variations.

AB  - From the past few years, massive volumes of structured, semi-structured and unstructured data are generated across various domains like healthcare, Internet of Things (IoT), finance and multimedia. Removing or ignoring irrelevant attributes from the data reduces the burden on Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. Traditional approaches faced challenges like handling high-dimensional data, scalability issues, limited interpretability, noise, outliers and curse of dimensionality. The need for effective feature selection and dimensionality reduction method improves the model performance by reducing computational costs and enhancing interpretability. In this survey, recent technological approaches based on ML and Deep Learning (DL) are explored for feature selection and dimensionality reduction in big data analytics. The approaches like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE) and autoencoders efficiently reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional data from the ImageNet dataset when compared with traditional approaches. The outcome illustrates that ML and DL techniques in this survey are well suited for feature selection and dimensionality reduction in big data analysis, especially in large-scale datasets like ImageNet.

AB  - In an era where data is abundant yet underutilized, organizations across various sectors face challenges in extracting actionable insights from complex, multi-modal datasets. To address these challenges, this study proposes a versatile data analytics framework designed to enhance predictive accuracy and support informed decision-making. The framework integrates structured and unstructured data, leveraging advanced Transformer architectures to capture temporal dynamics and complex interactions within the data. In a healthcare use case, the framework demonstrated its effectiveness by achieving an Accuracy of 0.854, an F1-Score of 0.895, and an AUC-ROC of 0.930, significantly outperforming traditional models. By incorporating SHAP for interpretability, the framework ensures that its predictions are both accurate and transparent, making it a valuable tool for decision-makers. While healthcare is one application, the framework's flexibility allows it to be adapted to a wide range of industries. Future work will focus on validating the framework across different sectors and integrating it into operational workflows to optimize decision-making and outcomes.

AB  - The integration of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is crucial for accurate medical diagnosis and treatment planning. However, translating images between CT and MR remains challenging due to significant differences in imaging modalities. To address this problem, we propose an Explainable Feature-Injected Diffusion Model (EIDM) for unsupervised CT-to-MR image translation. EIDM comprises a feature synthesis module and a diffusion-based latent space learning framework. This model captures frequency representations of the original CT images using the Fast Fourier Transform and applies high-pass filters to restore anatomical structures lost during diffusion. It also integrates weighted heatmaps generated by explainable AI models and utilizes a cross-attention mechanism to achieve unbiased image synthesis. We quantitatively evaluated EIDM and recent approaches using four metrics for comparison.

AB  - In the brain imaging genomic tasks, it is challenging to provide accurate prior knowledge for estimating the association between quantitative traits (QTs) extracted from neuroimaging and genetic markers like single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The hidden structural patterns in data limit the discovery of disease-related biomarkers. To this end, we present a deep ring-wise block network (RB-Net) for association analysis and brain disease diagnosis. Specifically, we first construct a new hidden structural pattern, namely, ring-wise block pattern, that satisfies both block and ring properties within the data before the association analysis. Subsequently, a RB-Net is developed via using an auto-encoder (AE) to represent imaging genomic data. Furthermore, we design the approach for joint association learning and automated brain disease diagnosis. Additionally, the optimization scheme based on alternating update is presented for solve the built ring-wise block-perception layer model. The performance of the designed method has been experimentally assessed on the brain imaging genomic data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The results validate that the proposed approach outperforms some competing approaches, establishes strong associations, and identifies crucial regions of interest (ROIs) across different imaging phenotypes associated with genetic risk biomarkers, thereby guiding disease interpretation and diagnosis prediction.

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly through the application of Vision Transformers (ViTs), have emerged as a groundbreaking approach for improving diagnostic accuracy in dermoscopy. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the utilization of Vision Transformers for skin disease diagnosis, with a particular focus on methodologies, performance assessments, challenges faced, and future research avenues, employing the widely-used HAM10000 dataset as a reference point. We begin by examining the foundational concepts of Vision Transformers and their architectural benefits, emphasizing their ability to process image data in a manner that effectively captures intricate patterns and contextual information compared to traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). A thorough analysis of existing studies showcases the efficacy of ViTs in various classification tasks within the realm of dermatology, addressing key performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. Additionally, we explore the critical challenges that remain in deploying Vision Transformers in clinical settings, including issues related to interpretability, data imbalances, and the need for large-scale labeled datasets. By synthesizing findings from numerous research efforts utilizing the HAM10000 dataset, we identify best practices and highlight opportunities for enhancing model robustness and generalizability through techniques like fine-tuning, data augmentation, and multi-task learning. In conclusion, this review not only elucidates the transformative impact of Vision Transformers on skin disease diagnosis but also sets the stage for future innovations in the field. By articulating the challenges and potential solutions, we aim to inspire further research that integrates advanced deep learning methodologies into dermatological practice, ultimately striving to improve diagnostic capabilities and patient outcomes.

AB  - Accurate prediction of in-hospital mortality is critical for healthcare risk management and clinical decision-making. However, existing time-series models struggle to model the non-stationarity and cross-periodic patterns in clinical data effectively, and their interpretability remains limited, particularly in addressing the dynamic importance of time-varying features and actionable counterfactual interventions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the xTimesNet-TSR-CoMTE framework, which integrates a hybrid spectral-temporal model, xTimesNet, with two interpretability methods: Two-Step temporal saliency Rescaling (TSR) and Counterfactual Multivariate Time series Explainability (CoMTE). xTimesNet leverages adaptive Wavelet-FFT mixture and Inception modules to capture cross-period temporal interactions in clinical time series. Experiments on the MIMIC-III dataset, involving 27 features over 48 timesteps, demonstrate the framework’s superior performance, achieving a ROC_AUC of 0.785 and PR_AUC of 0.403. Comparative analysis shows that CoMTE outperforms existing methods by generating clinically plausible counterfactuals with minimal modifications, as evidenced by the lowest L1 distance of 0.024 and zero violent feature modifications. TSR identifies critical time-varying features and their temporal importance, pinpointing systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and body temperature as the most impactful predictors of mortality. CoMTE generates actionable counterfactual explanations by suggesting minimal interventions on these key features, such as maintaining systolic blood pressure within a stable range during critical early time points. This study advances the application of time-series models in clinical risk analysis and offers a robust solution for interpretable and actionable mortality prediction.

AB  - Ensuring safe drinking water is crucial for public health, yet existing assessment methods often fail to capture complex contaminant interactions, provide real-time analysis, or offer model interpretability. Traditional threshold-based evaluations lack adaptability, while many machine learning models are opaque, making it difficult to understand key influencing factors. To address these challenges, we propose SafeH2O, a data-driven framework integrating machine learning and explainability techniques. The system applies data preprocessing, including normalization, feature scaling, and class balancing using SMOTE, to enhance dataset reliability. K-means clustering is employed to categorize water samples, followed by supervised classifiers—such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting—to predict water potability. Among them, Gradient Boosting achieves the highest accuracy of 93%. To improve interpretability, local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) is used to analyze key contaminants influencing water quality across clusters. Additionally, we design a health risk assessment microservice that issues real-time contamination alerts and safe water recommendations.

AB  - Privacy and regulatory barriers often hinder centralized machine learning solutions, particularly in sectors like healthcare where data cannot be freely shared. Federated learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm to address these concerns; however, existing frameworks primarily support gradientbased models, leaving a gap for more interpretable, tree-based approaches. This paper introduces a federated learning framework for Random Forest classifiers that preserves data privacy and provides robust performance in distributed settings. By leveraging PySyft for secure, privacy-aware computation, our method enables multiple institutions to collaboratively train Random Forest models on locally stored data without exposing sensitive information. The framework supports weighted model averaging to account for varying data distributions, incremental learning to progressively refine models, and local evaluation to assess performance across heterogeneous datasets. Experiments on two realworld healthcare benchmarks demonstrate that the federated approach maintains competitive predictive accuracy—within a maximum 9% margin of centralized methods—while satisfying stringent privacy requirements. These findings underscore the viability of tree-based federated learning for scenarios where data cannot be centralized due to regulatory, competitive, or technical constraints. The proposed solution addresses a notable gap in existing federated learning libraries, offering an adaptable tool for secure distributed machine learning tasks that demand both transparency and reliable performance.

Here, we extensively review state-of-the-art foundation models in various fields such as LLMs, GPT, BERT, CLIP, etc. We also demonstrate some famous areas where foundation models are gaining much popularity, such as general foundation models, foundation models in the medical domain, education, law and finance, mathematics, autonomous driving, etc. These foundation models are trained on large-scale data by leveraging the capabilities of self-supervised learning approaches that ensure outperforming accuracy for relevant downstream tasks. They are successful due to pioneering architectural innovations, especially synergistically interleaving transformers and convolutional neural networks. These models have exhibited adaptability and resilience in various data patterns and conditions through sophisticated training paradigms such as self-supervised and supervised learning methods. While they hold transformative potential, they also have many challenges. The scale and quality of training data are still important predictors of model performance, and the need for interpretable and explainable AI systems becomes critically important. We highlight important research opportunities, high-performing computationally efficient and scalable architectures, and approaches to enable multimodal learning capacities. This review sheds light on the current state of foundation models and proposes a roadmap for their successful transitions.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated notable success in many fields, including high-stakes applications like medical diagnosis support systems. These should not only provide accurate predictions but also offer insights into the decision-making process. Additionally, AI models may encounter challenging inputs, making it essential to incorporate uncertainty quantification, especially in medical applications, thus analyzing the model's robustness. This study proposes an approach that expands a gated-attention pooling mechanism in multiple instance learning framework, within a multi-headed version, to enable multi-class attention visualization. The model is integrated with Monte Carlo dropout (MCDO), which is a convenient Bayesian Neural Network approximation, for uncertainty quantification. The designed system is capable of not only classifying mammograms but also signaling its decision confidence and providing attentional heat maps along with image regions that are sensitive or uncertain in the diagnosis process. The impact of applying MCDO during the training (in the validation phase) and inference was investigated. Two models were trained, one with applying MCDO during the validation phase and the other without. Both models were subsequently tested with and without MCDO during the inference. To evaluate the proposed methodology in a real-world context, is has been applied to the task of breast cancer classification using mammography images. This cancer remains the most prevalent cancer in women worldwide, and the analysis of mammograms is time-consuming for radiologists due to the high resolution and image complexity, which makes it a representative and clinically significant use case. The results showed that the model tested with MCDO only during inference achieved the highest $\mathbf{5}$-fold cross-validation mean accuracy $(77.32 \%)$ and lower variability (standard deviation 2.73 % vs. 3.16 %). The implementation of MCDO only in attention heads did not result in significant computational time overhead. These results suggest that applying MCDO during the inference can improve model consistency and enables uncertainty quantification.

Object detection and phrase grounding deep learning models interpret complex radiology data to as-sist healthcare professionals in diagnosis. Object detection locates abnormalities for classes, while phrase grounding lo-cates abnormalities for textual descriptions. This paper inves-tigates how text enhances abnormality localization in chest X-rays by comparing the performance and explainability of these two tasks. To establish an explainability benchmark, we proposed an automatic pipeline to generate image regions for report sentences using radiologists' eye-tracking data1. The better performance - mIoU = 36% vs. 20% - and ex-plainability - Containment ratio 48% vs. 26% - of the phrase grounding model infers the effectiveness of text in enhancing chest X-ray abnormality localization.

AB  - The heart disease remains among the leading causes of death worldwide, which emphasizes the importance of early detection to enhance results and avoid complications like heart attacks. Traditional diagnostic methods are often expensive and time-consuming, creating a demand for faster, data-driven solutions. The prediction capabilities of Machine learning technology for heart disease detection have proven effective yet remain limited due to the problem known as class imbalance. computational complexity, and extensive hyperparameter tuning. Existing models like Gradient Boosting, SVM, and Neural Networks stands as their main achievement while they encounter problems with efficiency alongside limited generalization capabilities. This research proposes a new framework which applies the joint use of Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and Naive Bayes Classifier to resolve these problems, balancing computational simplicity with robust predictive power. The combination of SMOTE and Standard Scaler helps overcome class imbalance by creating new samples for minority classes and normalizes features to maintain model stability. Additionally, A novel feature selection method is presented, and the model accuracy is enhanced through this action which identifies the fundamental features that contribute to heart disease prediction. This innovative approach improves interpretability and performance, offering an efficient, scalable, and accessible solution for early heart disease detection, Healthcare systems benefit through improved patient outcomes and decreased healthcare burdens when nurses participate in the design phase of healthcare systems.

AB  - Diagnosing brain tumor is a key medical challenge where identification of the tumor is crucial to determine an appropriate treatment methodology. In this paper, we present a new hybrid deep learning model that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to take advantage of spatial and temporal features on multimodal MRI scans to better diagnose classifying diseases. It combines a CNN component to extract high level spatial features and an LSTM component to encode temporal dependencies between MRI slice features, thereby making a robust diagnostic system. The model was trained and validated using the publicly available BraTS dataset, achieving an accuracy of 97.8%, sensitivity of 98.5%, and specificity of 97.3%, outperforming state-of-the-art models such as ResNet50 (accuracy: 95. It was compared to a NeXt 3D (accuracy: 96.5%, 91.3% sensitivity, 99.8% specificity) and VGG16 (accuracy: 94.7%, 94.9% sensitivity, 94.3% specificity). An ablation study revealed a contribution of each module: the accuracy of the standalone CNN module is 92.4%, the standalone LSTM module is 90.1%, and the accuracy of the proposed hybrid model is 94.0%. The model's focus on tumor regions was validated by Grad-CAM visualizations that improved its interpretability for clinical applications. Both why and how it performed were proven through statistical analysis including confidence intervals and paired t-tests of p < 0.01. Our resulting CNN-LSTM hybrid model is proven by data as a reliable and interpretable means of brain tumor diagnosis that provides high diagnostic accuracy while being clinically interpretable. The future work is to experiment with integrating attentions and larger data sets to improve performance and scalability.

AB  - Traditional machine learning methods for movement recognition often struggle with limited model interpretability and a lack of insight into human movement dynamics. This study introduces a novel representation learning framework based on causal inference to address these challenges. Our twostage approach combines the Peter-Clark (PC) algorithm and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to identify and quantify causal relationships between human joints. By capturing joint interactions, the proposed causal Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) produces interpretable and robust representations. Experimental results on the EmoPain dataset demonstrate that the causal GCN outperforms traditional GCNs in accuracy, F1 score, and recall, particularly in detecting protective behaviors. This work contributes to advancing human motion analysis and lays a foundation for adaptive and intelligent healthcare solutions.

AB  - Understanding and predicting human behavior has emerged as a core capability in various AI application domains such as autonomous driving, smart healthcare, surveillance systems, and social robotics. This paper defines the technical frame-work of Artificial Behavior Intelligence (ABI), which comprehensively analyzes and interprets human posture, facial expressions, emotions, behavioral sequences, and contextual cues. It details the essential components of ABI, including pose estimation, face and emotion recognition, sequential behavior analysis, and context-aware modeling. Furthermore, we highlight the transformative potential of recent advances in large-scale pretrained models, such as large language models (LLMs), vision foundation models, and multimodal integration models, in significantly improving the accuracy and interpretability of behavior recognition. Our research team has a strong interest in the ABI domain and is actively conducting research, particularly focusing on the development of intelligent lightweight models capable of efficiently inferring complex human behaviors. This paper identifies several technical challenges that must be addressed to deploy ABI in real-world applications including learning behavioral intelligence from limited data, quantifying uncertainty in complex behavior prediction, and optimizing model structures for low-power, real-time inference. To tackle these challenges, our team is exploring various optimization strategies including lightweight transformers, graph-based recognition architectures, energy-aware loss functions, and multimodal knowledge distillation, while validating their applicability in real-time environments.

AB  - Speaker recognition technology, deployed in sectors like banking, education, recruitment, immigration, law enforcement, and healthcare, relies heavily on biometric data. However, the ethical implications and biases inherent in the datasets driving this technology have not been fully explored. Through a longitudinal study of close to 700 papers published at the ISCA Interspeech Conference in the years 2012 to 2021, we investigate how dataset use has evolved alongside the widespread adoption of deep neural networks. Our study identifies the most commonly used datasets in the field and examines their usage patterns. The analysis reveals significant shifts in data practices since the advent of deep learning: a small number of datasets dominate speaker recognition training and evaluation, and the majority of studies evaluate their systems on a single dataset. For four key datasets–Switchboard, Mixer, VoxCeleb, and ASVspoof–we conduct a detailed analysis of metadata and collection methods to assess ethical concerns and privacy risks. Our study highlights numerous challenges related to sampling bias, re-identification, consent, disclosure of sensitive information and security risks in speaker recognition datasets, and emphasizes the need for more representative, fair, and privacy-aware data collection in this domain.

AB  - Air pollution continues to remain a significant issue globally, where fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is the key source of harmful health effects and premature mortality. Precise PM2.5 prediction is important to issue warnings in time and adopt proper public health actions, but traditional models fail in handling complex, non-linear pollutant dynamics. A Voting Regressor ensemble of Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) is employed in this study to predict urban PM2.5 levels and estimate related mortality risk. The appropriate meteorological and pollutant variables are selected using data-driven tuning for lower uncertainty and higher interpretability. The model performs better with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.2721 and coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9998 on the test set. For 2025, the model estimates a national mean PM2.5 concentration of 37.37 μg/m3, by region varying from 1.01 to 103.45 μg/m3, equating to about 91 excess deaths per 100,000 population. Empirical evidence shows the ensemble approach's improved accuracy and stability, validating machine learning's analytical potential for urban environmental health.

This study introduces a dual-paradigm classification framework for organizing the stated objectives of 130 leading robotics laboratories across North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. The framework includes a Problem-Based paradigm that addresses core technical challenges and a Solution-Based paradigm that focuses on methodological strategies. Each laboratory’s objectives are encoded into a  $130\times 17$  binary matrix, enabling large-scale quantitative analysis. Spearman correlation analysis, corrected using the Benjamini–Hochberg False Discovery Rate (FDR) method, reveals statistically significant co-occurrence trends. Key findings include the synergy between artificial intelligence and cognition, a hardware–software divide, and underexplored intersections between AI and physical system innovation. In addition to correlation heatmaps, visualizations such as PCA biplots and radial similarity networks reveal research gaps and collaboration opportunities. These insights can guide agencies, industry partners, and academic institutions in shaping future robotics research. By identifying promising scientific directions, stakeholders can strategically combine these areas to develop more advanced, integrated, and capable robotic systems.

AB  - Across the globe, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) continues to be a critical healthcare burden due to its progressive and undetected decline in pulmonary function. In recent times, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) have been widely applied to lung sounds (LS) analysis, leading to the development of improved non-invasive, accessible, and scalable COPD screening methods. However, the shortcomings of CNNs and ViTs architectures restrict the COPD classifier’s discriminative power in distinguishing normal and COPD samples. In this study, a unique and interpretable COPD classification is proposed. This study introduces a hybrid feature extraction strategy integrating CNNs and ViTs architecture to capture the crucial COPD patterns from the LS’s Mel-spectrogram representation. The proposed CNNs-ViTs architecture addresses the limitations of standalone CNNs or ViTs architectures by capturing fine-grained acoustic features and long-range temporal dependencies while efficiently modeling non-linear relationships. A novel feature fusion is used to combine the heterogeneous features into a unified and highly discriminative feature representation space. A tailored hyperparameter optimization strategy is developed to fine-tune the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for classifying the features into normal and COPD classes. By incorporating internal (552 Healthy and 1324 COPD LS recordings) and external (35 Healthy and 77 COPD LS recordings) datasets, the authors evaluate the model’s performance. The model achieves a generalization accuracy of 97.62% and specificity of 96.51% on the external dataset. Through Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) overlays, the model’s interpretability is enhanced. The experimental findings highlight the effectiveness of the proposed COPD classification architecture in the domain of biomedical acoustic signal processing. Operating with minimal reliance on specialized diagnostic infrastructure renders the proposed model ideal for primary care and resource-limited environments.

AB  - Antibacterial susceptibility testing is fundamental for evaluating the efficacy of antimicrobial agents and addressing the growing challenge of bacterial resistance. Traditional methods, such as the Kirby-Bauer disk-diffusion test, are conducted at the macroscopic level, which restricts accuracy and disregards essential microscopic bacterial dynamics. In this study, we introduce a novel methodology that integrates microscopic imaging with deep learning to measure inhibition zones of Staphylococcus aureus, providing enhanced precision and deeper insights into bacterial behavior. A YOLOv8-based neural network was optimized using 74 microscopic training images and validated with 78 independent cases. The proposed approach achieved an accuracy of 89.74% within a tolerance of ±0.2 mm, exhibiting a strong Pearson correlation with expert measurements (r = 0.94). This performance represents a 90% reduction in measurement error compared to conventional Petri dish evaluations, where variability often reaches 2.0 mm. Additionally, the system demonstrated robustness across different microscope models, including one not employed during training, highlighting its generalization capacity. Beyond accuracy, this methodology enables automated, reproducible, and rapid measurements, significantly reducing analysis time while eliminating operator subjectivity. Importantly, by capturing bacterial growth dynamics at the microscopic scale, the method allows early detection of bacterial susceptibility, potentially reducing clinical decision-making times from days to hours. This advancement holds considerable promise for antimicrobial nanomaterial evaluation, epidemiological studies, and clinical diagnostics. To encourage transparency and facilitate further research, all datasets, codes, and experimental setups developed in this work have been made publicly available, ensuring reproducibility and promoting the extension of this methodology to other bacterial species.

AB  - Stroke continues to be the world's principal cause of death and disability; thus, their prevention and cure are reliant upon timely and proper predictions. This study is the comprehensive analysis of the comparison of the machine-learning methods of stroke prediction with clinical information that is contained in this article. Raw datasets and preprocessed datasets were tried for the above-mentioned models, namely, Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, Voting Classifier, Bagging Classifier, and Logistic Regression. For enhanced model stability and generalization, outlier removal was an essential data preprocessing step, especially in avg_glucose_level and bmi. Sampling methods like SMOTE, Random Undersampling, and SMOTETomek were employed in evaluating the risk of stroke. SMOTETomek performed optimally and was utilized to solve the class imbalance problem. It ensures balanced training through the fusion of majority undersampling with minority oversampling. The work of the model was greatly boosted by these preprocessing steps. With 96.2% accuracy, 96.2% recall, and 94.4% F1 score, the Random Forest classifier on preprocessed data topped all other models, demonstrating its robustness and usability for predicting strokes. Interpretability of the model was enhanced further by utilizing SHAP values. Clinical intuition was confirmed through the SHAP summary plot, which indicated that higher values of these characteristics significantly raised the risk of stroke. This comprehensive study presents an efficient and precise method for early stroke risk assessment within the healthcare system.

AB  - Stunting in toddlers is one of the most pressing nutritional issues in Indonesia. This condition, caused by chronic malnutrition, is a key indicator of maternal and infant health, particularly during early life. Regular monitoring of a toddler’s growth and development is necessary for preventing stunting. Therefore, developing accurate and efficient predictive models is essential. This study aims to analyze the performance of two Machine Learning models, namely Logistic Regression and Random Forest, in predicting stunting status in toddlers. The dataset used is toddler development data from the Kota Baru Health Center, Bekasi City. Due to the limited amount of data, the data split is performed using k-fold cross-validation with k=5 to maximize the dataset’s utilization. Given the imbalanced data, with 39.4% stunting from the total data, an oversampling method was applied to the minority class. Logistic Regression was selected for its simplicity and interpretability, whereas Random Forest was favored for its ability to handle data complexity by combining predictions from multiple decision trees. The evaluation results indicate that Random Forest outperforms Logistic Regression, achieving an average accuracy of 88.07% and a macro-average F1-score of 87.32%, compared to Logistic Regression’s average accuracy of 85.48% and macro-average F1-score of 84.73%. This research is expected to support stunting prevention in Indonesia by providing a predictive approach based on Machine Learning to improve the monitoring of toddlers’ growth and development.

AB  - Multiomics co-learning is a powerful analytical paradigm that has benefited biomedical studies substantially. However, due to the diverse information and complex relationships of multiomics data, naive multi-view learning methods usually run into spurious correlations and biased signatures irrelevant to the diseases of interest. Therefore, the learned representations and cross-omics associations cannot translate into clinical knowledge for disease prediction. This issue becomes particularly severe when clinical data are limited and scarce. To handle this issue, we propose a novel and powerful scheme, referred to as the Causality-driven Trustworthy Multi-View maPping approach (Cad-TMVP). Specifically, we design a fined multi-directional mapping module to extract co-expression patterns across different modalities and capture fine-grained interpretability factors. We also meticulously design dynamic mechanisms to facilitate adaptive loss-term reweighting and trustworthy integration of multiple modalities. Cad-TMVP enhances downstream tasks by developing a cooperative learning module that simultaneously performs automated diagnosis and result interpretation. Furthermore, we develop an efficient search strategy and support computation to reduce the high computational burden, making our approach practicable. We conduct extensive experiments on different types of multiomics data. The proposed method establishes new state-of-the-art results in various settings while maintaining excellent interpretability. Thus, it sets a potentially newparadigm in trustworthy multi-modal learning and verifies its flexibility and versatility in real biomedical applications.

Trained on vast amounts of data with parameter counts ranging from billions to trillions, models such as GPT-4, Claude, Grok, and Llama demonstrate remarkable proficiency in language comprehension, generation, and manipulation, including access to additional domains such as conversational systems, code generation, scientific writing, and creative content creation. This survey summarizes the evolution of LLMs, from early statistical methods and neural networks to modern transformer-based frameworks, emphasizing milestones like GPT-3’s few-shot learning and GPT-4o’s multimodal advancements. We present a comparative analysis of prominent LLMs, evaluating their architectures, parameter scales, and performance on benchmarks such as MMLU and MATH, with particular attention to Grok’s real-time knowledge integration. The study highlights LLMs’ transformative applications in academia, healthcare, education, and creative industries while addressing critical challenges, including biases, misinformation, computational demands, and interpretability limitations. We explore mitigation strategies such as retrieval-augmented generation and parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Further- more, we outline future directions, including multimodal LLMs, extended context processing, and ethical AI development, providing a comprehensive guide for researchers and practitioners shaping the responsible advancement of LLMs.

AB  - COVID-19 has strained global public health, necessitating accurate diagnosis and intervention to control disease spread and reduce mortality rates. This paper introduces an inter-pretable method Risk-RAM for survival prediction model designed specifically for improved understanding and trust in prognosis using chest X-ray (CXR) images. Our approach produces regional interpretable outcomes that effectively capture essential disease features while focusing on rare but critical abnormal regions. The predictive results provide enhanced clarity and transparency through risk area localization, enabling clinicians to make informed decisions regarding COVID-19 diagnosis with a better understanding of prognostic insights. We evaluate the proposed method on a multi-center survival dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness via quantitative and qualitative assessments, achieving superior C-indexes (0.764 and 0.727) and time-dependent AUCs (0.799 and 0.691). These results suggest that our explainable deep survival prediction model surpasses traditional survival analysis methods in risk prediction, improving interpretability for clinical decision making and enhancing AI system trustworthiness.

AB  - Chronic knee conditions and musculoskeletal (MSK) injuries are prevalent and pose significant challenges to global healthcare systems. Current diagnostic methods, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and X-ray, provide valuable insights but are limited by high costs and the inability to continuously monitor knee health. In response to these challenges, the proposed work makes the following contributions. First, a novel wearable knee health monitoring system is developed, incorporating a flexible composite piezoelectric film that captures subtle patellar displacements as early indicators of knee joint abnormalities. Second, a Bayesian machine learning framework incorporating both expert knowledge and diagnostic data is proposed to address the potential limitations of current machine learning-based diagnostic methods, such as low accuracy and poor interpretability in medical practice. This framework integrates causal discovery algorithms, clinical insights, and medical expertise to identify the key relationships between machine learning models and medical principles, ultimately improving diagnostic accuracy. Finally, the proposed system achieves an 83.3% success rate in distinguishing between healthy, sub-healthy, and unhealthy knee states, outperforming traditional methods with an accuracy improvement of 6.4%–17%. Furthermore, the system integrates a wireless sensor network and user-friendly software, enabling convenient monitoring and diagnosis in both clinical and home settings. The main innovation of this study lies in the design of a wearable sensor network structure based on patellar activity and a medical knowledge-guided Bayesian framework to enable a three-state classification diagnosis, namely, healthy, sub-healthy, and unhealthy. This system is particularly suited for knee health assessments in outpatient clinics, community settings, and home environments.

AB  - Epileptic seizure detection is one of the critical tasks in healthcare monitoring. These epileptic seizures occur because of unusual electrical impulses in the brain and can vary in seriousness, duration, and type. Many methods and procedures have been suggested for this automatic epilepsy seizure signals detection using AI and deep neural networks. With the help of an attention mechanism, this study introduces a novel hybrid deep learning framework that combines long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Electroencephalogram (EEG) data can be effectively analyzed by the suggested model to identify patterns in both space and time, enabling robust seizure detection. In this model, CNNs capture spatial patterns, while LSTMs capture temporal patterns. The methodology involves Dynamic temporal pooling and channel-based attention mechanisms to further refine feature extraction and improve model performance. An ensemble of multiple models is employed to enhance robustness and generalization.The proposed method achieves 99.40% accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art methods. This analysis provides interpretability, highlighting key EEG features contributing to seizure detection. This proposed model grants an encouraging solution for advancing the detection and control of epilepsy.

AB  - Despite progress in global healthcare systems, the utilization of domestic healthcare facilities remains limited in several regions, with a considerable proportion of people pursuing treatment overseas. This development highlights the necessity for systematic incorporation of patient-centered input, an essential element for enhancing accountability, transparency, and quality in local healthcare. Our research seeks to address this deficiency by establishing a system that collects and analyzes patient feedback to inform and improve healthcare policies and practices, particularly in areas with elevated demand for medical services. We offer an effective platform for viewing reviews from different hospitals, especially in places where people routinely visit for medical services. Therefore, we built our primary ”Dhaka Private Hospitals Review Dataset,” considering gathering and evaluating patient opinions methodically. We further employ transformer-based generative adversarial learning to evaluate sentiment analysis using knowledge distillation (KD) to boost model efficiency. Our proposed GANBERT architecture includes two optimized student models gated recurrent unit-based Contextualized BERT (GC-BERT) and LSTM-based Contextualized BERT (LC-BERT) with enhanced generators and discriminators. Our GC-BERT enhances execution time by 1.27% to 24.27%, while LC-BERT improves by 14.13% to 23.30%, showing superior advancements compared to other contemporary models. Each model with reductions ranging from 82.50% to 99.99% parameters, making them lightweight and efficient compared to other teacher models in the KD process. Instead of using contextual word representations which demand more space and complexity for reviewing patient feedback, we utilize the single static pretrained and low-dimensional word embedding space approach integrating student models.

AB  - Peptides can offer highly specific biological activities, serving as essential mediators of intercellular signaling, which are critical for advancing precision medicine and drug development. Their primary structure can be depicted either as an amino acid sequence or as a chemical molecules consisting of atoms and chemical bonds. Large language models (LLMs) hold the potential to thoroughly elucidate the intricate intrinsic properties of peptides. Here we present the Peptide Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (PKAN), a framework leveraging multi-modal representations inspired by advanced language models for peptide activity and functionality prediction. Comparative experiments across tasks show that PKAN outperforms state-of-the-art models while maintaining a streamlined design with superior predictive capabilities. The multi-modal feature importance scoring, anchored in global structures and the significant marginal impacts of derived features on the model, coupled with intricate symbolic regression of specific activation functions, further demonstrates the robustness and precision of the PKAN framework in identifying and elucidating key determinants of peptide functionality. This work provides scientific evidence for investigating the complex mechanisms of peptide materials and supports the progression of peptide language paradigms in biology.

AB  - Liver diseases are one of the most severe threats happening nowadays globally about health, in which millions of people suffer from such critical conditions and becomes life-threatening if not diagnosed earlier. The traditional models showcased limited accuracy, because earlier diagnostic methods were relying on statistical analysis and medical experts“ evaluation, which might not capture complex patterns in the data. In this research paper, machine learning techniques are used for predicting liver disease based on patient data obtained in terms of liver enzyme levels, bilirubin, and demographic features. The focus is on creating and comparing different ML models, such as Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Decision Trees and Logistic Regression, in the context of early diagnosis. In preprocessing data, handling missing values and dealing with issues of class imbalance, several steps are very significant for improving model performance. Some of the evaluation metrics, namely F1-score, precision, accuracy, recall, and AUC- ROC, have been used to measure the effectiveness of the models built. This work clearly suggests overfitting and interpretability, mainly in the context of medical data, but the results show that more sophisticated ML techniques can drastically improve prediction in the case of liver disease, especially very important insights for early intervention and clinical support systems in healthcare.

AB  - Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) causes difficulties in early diagnosis because of its multi-systemic impacts and inconsistent recognition patterns among patients. The proposed research incorporates a hybrid neural learning and classification system which unites Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) alongside an attention mechanism to deliver early and precise Lupus diagnosis. A validated medical dataset supplies the model with clinical and laboratory features that include ANA titers and anti-dsDNA levels and ESR and CRP and complement proteins (C3, C4). The preprocessing stage involves three steps which include KNN imputation and Z-score normalization and SMOTE-based class balancing. The method uses Mutual Information combined with Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to select features that reduce dimensions through Principal Component Analysis (PCA). A stratified 10-fold cross-validation method evaluates the model after Bayesian hyperparameter optimization which used the Adam optimizer for training purposes. The proposed architecture reaches 97.81% classification accuracy together with precision at 96.92%, recall at 98.13% and AUC-ROC at 0.99 and F1-score at 97.52%. Independent testing shows that the proposed hybrid framework outperforms regular ML models together with independent deep models. The developed model shows robust diagnostic potential to support clinical early Lupus diagnosis and decision-making processes.

AB  - Musculoskeletal disorder knee osteoarthritis (OA) is very prevalent and impacts quality of life demanding accurate grading to inform treatment planning. This study presents a novel deep learning approach based on combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks to enhance the accuracy of OA grading. In this, we integrate spatial feature extraction by a ResNet50 backbone and temporal sequence modeling by LSTM which is able to capture both the structural and temporal patterns from radiographic images. Experimental evaluations using the OAI and KAG datasets together with radiographs images classified according to the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) scale are presented. Using the proposed CNN-LSTM model, we achieve accuracy of 92.3%, outperforming previous traditional models (ResNet50 achieves 87.5%; DenseNet-LSTM achieves 89.8%). On the other hand, the model also did better in terms of precision (91.5%), recall (91.8%) and F1-score (91.6%) which shows that it worked well in terms of balance between false positives and false negatives. The robustness of the model was further confirmed via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis with an area under the curve (AUC) greater than 0.90 across all KL grades. Through varying interpretability, the Grad-CAM visualizations helped validate the results by identifying key join areas of relevance to the OA task. The results show that the proposed CNN-LSTM framework is an accurate, reliable and interpretable solution for automated OA grading. Future work will include improving generalization of the model by augmenting the dataset with multi-modal data from many different patient populations.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a major cause of death worldwide, taking almost 18 million lives each year. ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) is one of the highest contributors to the same. The immediate 30-day period post-STEMI is critical in judging long-term patient outcomes. Thus, there is a need for an accurate risk predictor to guide clinical interventions immediately after STEMI. In this paper, we propose CardioRiskNet, a post-STEMI 30-day mortality predictor based on Graph Convolutional Networks, designed to adapt to different populations with the relational nature of graph-based models. To address class imbalance, we propose a data synthesis method for CVD data by introducing a self-attention mechanism in a Conditional Variational Autoencoder. To demonstrate robustness, the model has been tested on three datasets including two publicly available datasets. CardioRiskNet shows better performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Posthoc interpretability analysis also suggests that CardioRiskNet offers promising advancements in data-driven risk assessment, providing clinicians with a precise tool for patient management.

AB  - Forecasting migraine attacks before they occur can significantly enhance the quality of life for patients by allowing them to take preemptive measures to mitigate or prevent the onset of symptoms. In this study, we aim to predict migraine attacks by leveraging the largest real-world migraine dataset available to date, collected from a mobile app between 2016 and 2022, it encompasses approximately 43,000 users and 7 million daily records gathered throughout the entire 6-year period. We introduce TRACE (Temporal Recurrent Autoencoder for Concept Embedding), a novel approach developed to anticipate migraine attacks. On two held-out sets, using 2-day and 3-day lookback data, TRACE successfully predicts approximately 70% of migraine episodes before their onset, outperforming competing methods in terms of sensitivity, i.e., accurately predicting migraine days. TRACE maintains a comparable specificity of around 60%, i.e., accurately predicting no-headache days. To understand the predictive factors driving models performance, we conduct both global and local feature importance analyses. Global importance is assessed using ablation analysis and Random Forest, while local importance is evaluated on a per-patient basis using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Our SHAP analysis show that while common migraine triggers exist, individual triggers can vary significantly, highlighting the need for personalized predictive tools.

AB  - Ensuring pharmaceutical supply chains are transparent and secure is important to avoid the risks associated with counterfeit medicines and illicit distribution. Centralized databases subject to data forgery and manipulation are common in traditional systems, and as a result, drug authenticity and patient safety are compromised. To overcome such issues, this research presents a new AI-blockchain framework for trustworthy pharmaceutical traceability. Building on the Ethereum blockchain, the system presented has drug transaction records tamper-proofed and applies smart contracts to automate functions in the supply chains. An AI-based chatbot with natural language processing (NLP) improves user interface through real-time drug verification services, prescription recommendations, and preventive healthcare tips. The addition of AI increases accessibility and usability as stakeholders such as manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and customers are all able to check drug authenticity with ease. Experimental testing proves to show considerable data security, transactional transparency, and user engagement improvements. The findings confirm that the integration of blockchain and AI improves pharmaceutical traceability to produce a healthier and trusted healthcare ecosystem.

AB  - Heart disease remains a major global health chal- lenge, contributing significantly to mortality rates each year. Timely diagnosis is crucial in minimizing severe complications and enhancing treatment effectiveness. Traditional diagnostic methods rely on clinical evaluations, medical tests, and expert analysis, which may be time-consuming and susceptible to human error. With technological advancements, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have emerged as promising approaches to improve the accuracy and efficiency of heart disease prediction. This study introduces a hybrid ML-DL framework that leverages Random Forest (RF) for feature selection, while Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are employed for classification. By incorporating both structured clinical data and sequential patient history, this approach aims to enhance predictive accuracy. We utilize well-established datasets, including the Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset and the Framingham Heart Study Dataset, for training and evaluating various models. A comparative anal- ysis is conducted between different classifiers, such as Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and individual deep learning architectures. Performance evaluation is carried out using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The proposed RF + CNN-LSTM hybrid model achieves an accuracy of 92.3. The findings highlight the benefits of integrating structured medical data with deep learning-based feature extraction for improved heart disease prediction. This research contributes to the development of more reliable, data-driven diagnostic tools to assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions. Future work will explore real-time prediction models using wearable devices, explainable AI (XAI) for enhanced model interpretability, and privacy-preserving techniques for secure medical data management. AI-driven healthcare systems hold the potential to revolutionize disease diagnosis, making medical care more proactive, efficient, and accessible.

AB  - Health care fraud detection remains a critical challenge, particularly within Medicare and Medicaid systems. Traditional detection methods often fail when confronted with adversarial tactics, highlighting the need for more adaptive and proactive approaches. This manuscript leverages retrieval-augmented generation for red-teaming in the context of health care fraud detection. The proposed system generates diverse fraud scenarios that allow for stress-testing. We present the conceptual design, illustrate red-teaming using Medicare data, and discuss its integration with Bayesian decision-making frame-works. By embedding domain-specific contextual knowledge, the framework could enhance fraud identification and compliance analysis.

AB  - Accurate detection and classification of gastrointestinal (GI) pathological findings from endoscopic images remain a challenge due to limited generalizability and lack of interpretability in existing models. Most deep learning approaches classify GI findings broadly as diseases or focus on a limited number of conditions. This study proposes a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, leveraging ResNet50 feature extraction to classify a broader range of GI pathological conditions. Using the Kvasir and Gastrovision datasets, the model achieved 96.33% accuracy on the test set. Grad-CAM visualizations enhance interpretability, ensuring clinically relevant feature localization. Results indicate improved diagnostic accuracy, consistency, and workflow efficiency for endoscopists. Future work includes developing separate models for upper and lower GI conditions, expanding real-world validation, and implementing federated learning for privacy-preserving clinical integration. These improvements will ensure greater adoption of AI-assisted endoscopic diagnostics, enhancing patient outcomes and healthcare efficiency.

AB  - TabNet is a novel deep learning architecture proposed to overcome the limitations of traditional deep learning models in progress with tabular data, including diverse features, sparse datasets, and interpretability. With the capabilities of sequential attention mechanisms and selective feature sparsity, an optimal balance between accuracy and clarity can be achieved, enabling feature transformation that outperforms any model like XGBoost in revealing complex feature interactions. It has been proved flexible in many various fields such as finance, healthcare, energy prediction, environmental monitoring, etc. However, the TabNet exhibits several weaknesses, including its computational intensity, sensitivity to noise, and its limited compatibility with heterogeneous/multi-modal systems. The paper presents a Feature Fusion methodology that embeds TabNet's intermediate attention outputs with the initial attribute set in order to create a more complete and robust representation of the data. The fusion boosts TabNet's ability to catch and handle anomalies and outliers, especially in the financial forecasting scenarios where substantial market shocks and extreme events cause significant changes in predictions. By employing a real-world dataset about the stock market as a benchmark, our experiments demonstrate that TabNet + Feature Fusion significantly enhances performance metrics mainly in the context of Root Mean Squared Percentage Error (RMSPE) which is highly sensitive to outliers. The findings confirm that this actual approach not only addresses the limitations of traditional TabNet but also provides a powerful tool for tackling complex, high-dimensional, and noisy tabular data in various critical domains as well as finance.

AB  - Personalized healthcare (PHC) aims to tailor optimal treatments for patients based on their heterogeneity. Causality plays a significant role in supporting PHC by providing estimation tools for subpopulation based heterogeneous treatment effect (HTE) estimation. In this study, our goal is to leverage a practical causal inference technique, Causal Trees to estimate HTEs for critical care patients who need ventilation support. Precisely, we aim to identify which treatment strategy - liberal vs. conservative oxygenation is optimal and which covariates are important for different groups of ICU patients based on their HTE estimates using an ensemble of causal trees. From the experimental findings, we can deduct a set of decision rules which further needs to be validated by taking the opinions of clinical researchers and domain experts. Unlike traditional Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems that rely on correlations, our causally-grounded approach ensures that recommendations are based on true cause-and-effect relationships, enhancing both reliability and clinical trust. Our findings contribute to the broader goal of building causally-aware AI systems capable of generalizing to diverse domains, including autonomous systems and emergency response, where managing uncertainty is crucial. By merging interpretability with data-driven, causally-grounded insights, this work aims to foster trust, transparency, and effective human-AI collaboration in critical decision-making.

AB  - In the era of digital transformation, trust and security are paramount in ensuring the integrity of various online transactions and processes, including voting systems. Traditional centralized trust management and voting systems have faced challenges related to security, transparency, and accountability. To address these issues, this research introduces a novel Blockchain-Enabled Decentralized Trust Management and Secure Voting System. It leverages blockchain technology, a decentralized and immutable ledger, to enhance trust, transparency, and security in trust management and voting processes. This system combines several key components, including smart contracts, cryptographic techniques, and distributed ledger technology, to create a robust and tamper-resistant infrastructure. In the trust management aspect, the proposed system employs a decentralized reputation system where individuals and entities can build trust through transparent and verifiable interactions. Smart contracts automate trust-building processes and provide a reliable mechanism for dispute resolution. This system allows for trust to be quantified and established in a trustless environment. The secure voting component introduces a tamper-proof and transparent voting system. Through the use of cryptographic keys and digital signatures, voters can securely cast their votes while ensuring anonymity and integrity. All voting transactions are recorded on the blockchain, providing a permanent and auditable record of the election process. Verification of election results becomes accessible to all stakeholders, enhancing transparency and trust in the electoral process. The Blockchain-Enabled Decentralized Trust Management and Secure Voting System represents a significant step towards enhancing trust and security in critical online processes, such as voting. By combining blockchain technology, cryptography, and decentralized trust mechanisms, it offers a promising solution to address the challenges associated with centralized trust management and voting systems. This research paves the way for a more transparent, secure, and accountable future in the realm of digital trust and elections.

AB  - Anomaly detection in multivariate time series (MTS) is crucial in domains such as industrial monitoring, cybersecurity, healthcare, and autonomous driving. Deep learning approaches have improved anomaly detection but lack interpretability. We propose an explainable anomaly detection (XAD) framework using a sparse non-linear vector autoregressive network (SNL-VAR-Net). This framework combines neural networks with vector autoregression for non-linear representation learning and interpretable models. We employ regularization to enforce sparsity, enabling efficient handling of long-range dependencies. Additionally, augmented Lagrange multiplier-based techniques for low-rank and sparse decomposition reduce the impact of noise. Evaluation on publicly available datasets shows that SNL-VAR-Net offers comparable performance to deep learning methods with better interpretability.

AB  - Masses of people around the world are affected by Parkinson's disease (PD), a progressive neurological disorder. Timely and precise diagnosis is critical for effective management. Yet conventional diagnostic methods often lack compassion and specificity. Advances in machine learning and cerebral imaging offer promising approaches to improve PD diagnosis. This investigation investigates an ensemble machine learning move toward to enhance the identification of Parkinson's disease using cerebral imaging data. By integrating models such as decision trees (DT), support vector machines (SVM), and neural networks, the ensemble method combines their strengths to create a reliable diagnostic system. Feature extraction and preprocessing further enhance interpretability and performance. Compared to individual models, the ensemble approach significantly improves diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Brain imaging aids differential diagnosis in Parkinsonism, but no Cerebral imaging methods is currently recommended for routine clinical practice despite their proven utility. Larger trial are needed to validate the medical value and long-standing cost-effectiveness of Cerebral imaging for managing patients within healthcare systems like the NHS.

Technology has revolutionized various aspects of life such as healthcare systems, smart home, smart vehicles, etc. However, it also showed security weaknesses due to a lack of regulation and standards. This causes security threats and risks to malicious exploitation and therefore hacking opportunities. The digital vulnerabilities are a big concern in medical systems; to highlight this issue, this paper designed a simple ease of use AI-based intrusion detection framework that can detect and classify traffic of IoT networks to normal or malicious in real-time manner. To accomplish the goal of this research, CICIoMT2024 dataset is applied, which includes diverse IoT traffic data and features commonly targeted by attackers. The machine learning models trained on this dataset showed impressive results, achieving up to 97% accuracy in classifying network traffic for cybersecurity applications.

AB  - Univariate time series forecasting is pivotal in domains such as climate modeling, finance, and healthcare, where both short-term precision and long-term reliability are essential. This study introduces AUNET (Attention-based Unified Network)—a novel extension of the N-BEATS model—integrating multi-head self-attention to capture both short-term fluctuations and long-term dependencies while reducing architectural redundancy and enhancing interpretability. Empirical evaluations on the (baseline dataset for this research) CIMIS weather dataset show that AUNET achieves a 0.3580 MAE, 0.4632 RMSE, 0.68% MAPE, and an R2 of 0.9988, outperforming baseline models including N-BEATS and attention-augmented variants by margins exceeding 87% in MAE and RMSE. AUNET’s generalization capabilities are further validated on diverse domains: in finance it attains an R2 of 0.9990, and in healthcare, it outperforms baselines in RMSE and R2 despite inherent volatility. Statistical assessments confirm the significance and robustness of these improvements. Moreover, AUNET demonstrates reduced training time, lower FLOPs, and higher convergence stability. Its attention-guided modular architecture not only enhances predictive accuracy but also promotes transparency, making AUNET a compelling candidate for deployment in high-stakes, real-world forecasting tasks across varied domains.

AB  - In developing predictive models, data scientists and software engineers have mainly aimed to improve accuracy; however, aspects like model interpretability, distribution, computational complexity, and result communication also require detailed attention. In healthcare, where constant access is essential, relying on server connections can be risky, making local model storage necessary despite the limited capabilities of mobile devices. To address this, we propose using a Gated Recurrent Unit framework trained on fuzzy linguistic labels, achieving prediction accuracy comparable to models trained on raw data while adding semantic interpretability to the results. Our case study focuses on continuous glucose monitoring in people with diabetes. The key contribution of this work is an open-source mobile app that provides real-time glycemic change notifications, using a personalized model for each patient to support independence and proactive disease management.

AB  - Continuous monitoring in A/B testing is widely used for selecting options, variants, or treatments in healthcare analytics. However, the appropriate stopping strategy for A/B testing in continuous monitoring remains unclear. This study proposes a Bayesian A/B testing method for continuous monitoring, incorporating a martingale stopping strategy. A uniform Beta distribution is used as the prior in the Bayesian A/B testing method. The posterior expected loss is employed as the criterion for choosing an option. When the posterior expected loss falls below a preset threshold, the result of the continuous monitoring is accepted for the A/B testing. With the proposed method, continuous monitoring of the null hypothesis (that the conversion rate of A is less than that of B) is managed using the posterior expected loss. The results obtained using the martingale stopping strategy enhance the interpretability of the A/B testing process. Finally, the effectiveness of the Bayesian A/B testing method is validated through numerical experiments on both simulated data and real-world applications.

AB  - Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) play a significant role in saving the lives of high-risk infants. However, conventional monitoring systems primarily focus on real-time tracking without integrating predictive analytics, leading to delays in identifying potentially life-threatening conditions such as jaundice, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, hydrocephalus, microcephaly, or respiratory failure. The proposed novel framework addresses the gap identified above by using noninvasive Internet of Things (IoT)-)-enabled devices with advanced machine learning models to monitor critical health metrics—such as heart rate, oxygen saturation, and body temperature—in real-time. The proposed architecture uses a hybrid Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach by combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with Gradient Boosting techniques, particularly XGBoost, to improve prediction performance and get around overfitting. This approach proactively detects possible health hazards by utilizing IoT sensor data. Compared to the existing techniques, the proposed model performs better, with an accuracy of 95.89% when tested on a dataset of neonatal conditions. The high efficiency of the proposed system offers promising potential for early diagnosis of neonatal conditions and improved health outcomes through intervention before serious complications arise. Neonatal care is handled proactively rather than reactively in this prototypical attempt toward innovative, technology-oriented health systems. Future works will focus on handling data privacy issues and scaling the dataset to optimize model interpretability in IoT-based healthcare systems.

AB  - Neuromorphic computing has emerged as a promising energy-efficient alternative to traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs), predominantly utilizing spiking neural networks (SNNs) implemented on neuromorphic hardware. SNNs are more energy-efficient and excel at processing spatio-temporal data than ANNs. Significant advancements have been made in SNN-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer architectures. However, neuromorphic computing for the medical imaging domain remains underexplored. In this study, we introduce EG-SpikeFormer, an SNN architecture tailored for clinical tasks that incorporates eye-gaze data to guide the model's attention to the diagnostically relevant regions in medical images. Our developed approach effectively addresses shortcut learning issues commonly observed in conventional models, especially in scenarios with limited clinical data and high demands for model reliability, generalizability, and transparency. Our EG-SpikeFormer not only demonstrates superior energy efficiency and performance in medical image prediction tasks but also enhances clinical relevance through multi-modal information alignment. By incorporating eye-gaze data, the model improves interpretability and generalization, opening new directions for applying neuromorphic computing in medical image analysis.

AB  - Deep-learning models have been widely used in image recognition tasks due to their strong feature-learning ability. However, most of the current deep-learning models are “black box” systems that lack a semantic explanation of how they reached their conclusions. This makes it difficult to apply these methods to complex medical image recognition tasks. The vision transformer (ViT) model is the most commonly used deep-learning model with a self-attention mechanism that shows the region of influence as compared to traditional convolutional networks. Thus, ViT offers greater interpretability. However, medical images often contain lesions of variable size in different locations, which makes it difficult for a deep-learning model with a self-attention module to reach correct and explainable conclusions. We propose a multigranularity random walk transformer (MGRW-Transformer) model guided by an attention mechanism to find the regions that influence the recognition task. Our method divides the image into multiple subimage blocks and transfers them to the ViT module for classification. Simultaneously, the attention matrix output from the multiattention layer is fused with the multigranularity random walk module. Within the multigranularity random walk module, the segmented image blocks are used as nodes to construct an undirected graph using the attention node as a starting node and guiding the coarse-grained random walk. We appropriately divide the coarse blocks into finer ones to manage the computational cost and combine the results based on the importance of the discovered features. The result is that the model offers a semantic interpretation of the input image, a visualization of the interpretation, and insight into how the decision was reached. Experimental results show that our method improves classification performance with medical images while presenting an understandable interpretation for use by medical professionals.

AB  - Question-answering (QA) systems have become crucial in healthcare, decision-making, finance, and research domains. While transformer-based language models have greatly enhanced the generation of contextually relevant answers, they often struggle to provide reliable answers, leading to hallucinations and incorrect predictions. Traditional evaluation metrics, such as exact match, precision, recall, and F1 metric, demonstrate significant limitations in comprehensively assessing the performance and capabilities of QA systems. This research introduces a commonsense reasoning-based evaluation framework for language models, leveraging the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning approach. Our proposed method integrates CoT reasoning with a GPT o1-mini model to evaluate the predictions from language models. Experiments conducted on the SQuAD 2.0 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in handling the answers generated by the language models and increase the reliability of the QA system. The framework offers robust and interpretable solutions, addressing critical gaps in current QA systems and ensuring reliability and transparency for practical, real-world applications.

AB  - In this paper, we present FlexiFed, a framework designed to enhance Federated Learning (FL) by addressing the challenges of device inclusivity and data prioritization. FL systems typically exclude low-resource devices, known as stragglers, due to their limited computational power, leading to the loss of valuable and often unique data. Additionally, current FL systems lack transparency, making it difficult to prioritize the contributions of individual devices. FlexiFed overcomes these issues by enabling stragglers to share simplified outputs, such as predictions and key feature importance scores, instead of full model updates. This reduces their computational and communication burden. The framework integrates explainability techniques to identify and emphasize critical data, ensuring rare and significant contributions are prioritized during training. FlexiFed distinguishes itself from similar frameworks by combining hierarchical aggregation with explainability-driven prioritization, directly addressing the need for fairness and transparency in diverse and resource-constrained environments.

AB  - There has been a recent strategic push globally to integrate digital pathology analysis into national health programs, which has been further encouraged by the emergence of large pathology foundation models which promise to make analysis of such data possible at scale in future. However, large scale clinical deployment of such systems remain a challenge in settings where datasets arrive over extended time, and there are requirements of adaptation to new classes of data over time. Also, in many clinical and pharmaceutical settings, retention of past data is often complicated by privacy issues, legal requirements, or storage constraints. Existing deep architectures are susceptible to decline in performance when trained on new tasks over time, in a phenomenon termed as catastrophic forgetting, addressing which is one of the key challenges towards enabling robust learning systems. This is particularly compounded in digital pathology as often new classes will have heterogeneous samples in limited numbers which need to be learned robustly in an explainable and trustworthy manner, as required by emerging legislation worldwide that call for AI safety and transparency in high risk applications like healthcare. We mitigate catastrophic forgetting by designing enhanced representation learning for histology image analysis, which not only improves continual learning performance under non-stationary data environments, but does so in an interpretable, and hence trustworthy manner.

AB  - Wearable biosensors have revolutionized human performance monitoring by enabling real-time assessment of physiological and biomechanical parameters. However, existing solutions lack the ability to simultaneously capture breath-force coordination and muscle activation symmetry in a seamless and non-invasive manner, limiting their applicability in strength training and rehabilitation. This work presents a wearable smart sportswear system that integrates screen-printed graphene-based strain sensors with compact electronics for wireless data transfer and a deep learning framework for real-time classification of exercise execution quality. By leveraging 1D ResNet-18 for feature extraction, the system achieves 92.1% classification accuracy across six exercise conditions, distinguishing between breathing irregularities and asymmetric muscle exertion. Additionally, tSNE analysis and Grad-CAM-based explainability visualization confirm that the network accurately captures biomechanically relevant features, ensuring robust interpretability. The proposed system establishes a foundation for next-generation AI-powered sportswear, with applications in fitness optimization, injury prevention, and adaptive rehabilitation training.

Given the importance of early detection for managing its progression, Artificial Intelligence (AI)—especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)—has emerged as a promising tool for predicting COPD using medical imaging and diagnostic data. This review examines the current state of COPD prediction with CNNs, emphasizing the datasets utilized, the challenges encountered, and the potential clinical applications. This study provides a thorough analysis of both public and proprietary datasets commonly used for training and validating CNN models, and it also discusses key limitations related to data collection, annotation, and patient population variability. Additionally, this paper highlights critical challenges such as model interpretability, generalization to diverse populations, and the integration of CNN results into clinical workflows. Ethical considerations, including data privacy and the influence of biased datasets on model accuracy, are also explored. By addressing these gaps and challenges, the review offers recommendations for future research to strengthen the robustness and reliability of CNN-based COPD prediction, paving the way for improved early detection tools in healthcare.

AB  - Pneumonia is a leading cause of illness and death among children under five, particularly in low-resource settings with limited access to radiological and laboratory diagnostics. This work presents a scalable AI-based framework for early detection of pediatric pneumonia using respiratory sound analysis. The approach leverages Google’s Health Acoustic Representations (HeAR), a foundation model trained on over 300 million health-related audio samples, to extract 512-dimensional embeddings from 2-second respiratory sound clips.The SPRSound dataset is a clinically curated, open-access collection of pediatric respiratory sounds and is used to identify pneumonia-related anomalies, such as Fine Crackles and Coarse Crackles. These serve as positive indicators, while normal breath sounds act as negative controls. After generating embeddings with HeAR, several classical machine learning models, including SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and MLP, are trained to classify abnormal lung sounds.The system achieves strong performance across evaluation metrics, with accuracy exceeding 93 percent and favorable precision-recall tradeoffs for pneumonia-positive cases. Interpretability is enhanced using PCA projections, confusion matrices, and barcode-style embedding visualizations. The results highlight the potential of short respiratory clips, processed through foundation audio models, to enable early and explainable screening for pediatric pneumonia. This approach supports the development of AI-assisted diagnostics in child healthcare.

AB  - Big data classification has emerged as a key challenge in the contemporary era of data-driven decision making. While standard machine learning approaches struggle under high-volume, high-velocity, and high-variety environments, fuzzy rule-based systems hold promise for enhancing both interpretability and scalability. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called the Fuzzy Rule-Based Granularity Model (FRBGM), which combines fuzzy sets, rough sets, and adaptive data granulation strategies to manage large-scale, heterogeneous datasets with minimal loss of accuracy. The architecture comprises three main components: a Data Preprocessing Engine (DPE) for robust imputation and data cleaning, a Fuzzy Granule Generator (FGGU) for creating interpretable granular partitions, and a Rule Formation and Inference module that consolidates individual fuzzy rules into a compact rule base. Experiments on various benchmark datasets-including NASA's small-body database and different IoT/healthcare repositories-demonstrate that FR-BGM achieves higher or comparable classification accuracy compared to popular baseline classifiers such as SVM, Random Forest, and fuzzy c-means, while requiring fewer computational resources. The synergy between fuzzy logic and rough sets in FRBGM effectively mitigates classification errors arising from noise and uncertainty, underscoring the suitability of our proposed model for real-world applications. We discuss the theoretical underpinnings of fuzzy granulation, evaluate the model's performance in terms of accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency, and outline key directions for future work in large-scale data analytics and fuzzy classification.

AB  - The security of deep neural networks (DNNs) is a major worry, despite the fact that deep learning has revolutionised several industries due to its fast development. Misclassifications caused by adversarial attacks, which are undetectable modifications of input data, can have catastrophic effects in autonomous driving, healthcare, and security surveillance, among other sensitive applications. In order to protect DNNs from these manipulative adversarial attacks, this work examines adversarial robustness strategies in detail. Three main approaches—adversarial training, input transformation, and gradient masking—are the focus of our classification and evaluation of existing defence measures. The effectiveness of each approach in strengthening the model's resilience is assessed by considering how well it maintains accuracy and efficiency. We also present a benchmark methodology for testing defence efficacy uniformly against different types and intensities of attacks, including FGSM, PGD, and C&W attacks. We also look into new developments in certified robustness, a field that aims to provide formal guarantees of model resilience against adversarial perturbations within a certain bound. While adversarial training does provide the best robustness in both white-box and black-box situations, hybrid approaches that combine input transformation with adversarial training have the potential to reduce computing load while boosting robustness, according to the experimental data. The importance of developing more accurate and scalable defence mechanisms is emphasised by our findings, which draw attention to important trade-offs between model interpretability, computational complexity, and robustness. In its last section, this study suggests avenues for further investigation into adversarial defence, with a focus on finding solutions that are independent of specific models and utilising adaptive learning techniques. In order to protect DNNs from ever-evolving hostile threats, these developments are crucial for their implementation in practical applications.

AB  - Glucose metabolism disorder has the potential to adversely affect various organs, including the eyes, coronary arteries, and kidneys, through multiple mechanisms. Consequently, it ranks among the foremost contributors to disability and premature mortality globally. The number of deaths from glucose metabolism disorder is increasing year by year, so developing a system that can correctly detect people with glucose metabolism disorder is essential. This study presents an advanced medical decision-making system that uses L-norm Support Vector Machine with pre-trained UNet (ι - SVM with UNet) to forecast glucose metabolism disorder. These state-of-the-art algorithms, well-known in computer vision, image analysis, and natural language processing, show promise in producing highly accurate outcomes when used for predictive and medical diagnostic applications. Furthermore, their integration with medical data can significantly improve the decision-making process's adaptability, transparency, and effectiveness. A comparative analysis is conducted between the ι - SVM with UNet algorithm's performance, various established methodologies, and several widely used machine learning (ML) techniques. The findings of the study show that the suggested approach, which is based on ι - SVM with UNet technology, performs admirably, attaining an F1-score of 96% and an accuracy of 96%. This enhancement can increase the correctness of the final judgment while saving effort, labor, and time in healthcare services.

AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), one of the most common sleep disorders globally, is closely linked to brain function. Resting-state electroencephalography (EEG), due to its convenience, cost-effectiveness, and high temporal resolution, serves as a valuable tool for exploring the human brain function. This study utilized a large cohort with 968 participants who joined in 15-minute daytime resting-state EEG acquisition and overnight polysomnography (PSG) monitoring. Participants were categorized into healthy controls and mild, moderate, and severe OSA groups based on apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) derived from PSG data. Resting-state EEG functional connectivity (FC) was estimated using correlation (Corr), coherence (Coh), phase-locking value (PLV), and phase lag index (PLI). Results showed that FC between most nodes increased with the OSA severity, which suggest the potential neural compensation. However, regional decreases emerged in the right central, right frontal, left central, and left parieto-occipital regions. Higher frequency bands exhibited fewer enhanced FC connections. Graph-theoretical analysis revealed reduced centrality, indicating weakened communication hubs and potential topological reorganization. Multivariate analysis with adjustment of age, sex, and BMI, was also used as a feature selection strategy, identified effective FC features of OSA severity (p value < adjusted significance threshold, 2.15e-5). These FC features were used in machine learning models for severity classification and enhanced interpretability. The Corr-based XGBoost model achieved the highest performance, with an accuracy of 0.79 and AUC of 0.90. These findings highlight OSA-related brain function alterations and demonstrate that resting-state EEG FC provides a non-invasive, task-free and interpretable tool for OSA severity classification without disrupting natural sleep.

AB  - Smartphone addiction has become a growing concern, affecting mental health, academic performance, and social interactions. Existing prediction models often focus solely on behavioral data, such as screen time and app usage, or psychological traits, such as the Big Five personality dimensions. This study proposes an integrated machine learning approach that combines both behavioral and psychological factors to enhance the accuracy of smartphone addiction prediction among students.Using a dataset of 569 engineering students, the model incorporates variables such as screen time, app usage patterns, and personality traits, including neuroticism and conscientiousness. A Random Forest Classifier was employed due to its robustness and interpretability. The model achieved an overall accuracy of 96%, with precision, recall, and F1-scores of 0.94, 0.95, and 0.96, respectively, across different addiction levels. Feature importance analysis identified key behavioral and psychological predictors, while explainability techniques, such as Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), provided insights into individual predictions. These findings contribute to the development of a predictive framework for smartphone addiction, offering a practical tool for academic institutions and healthcare providers to implement targeted intervention strategies.

AB  - With its robust capabilities for non-linear regression and classification, kernel-based learning has emerged as a fundamental component of state-of-the-art machine learning approaches. In order to improve probabilistic learning, this study investigates Adaptive Kernel Optimization (AKO), a new method that combines the best features of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the Gaussian Process (GP) frameworks. Achieving better flexibility in modeling complicated data distributions while keeping computational efficiency is achieved by employing adaptive kernel functions in the suggested strategy. Quantifying uncertainty in addition to deterministic SVM classifications is made possible with the incorporation of GP kernels, which offer probabilistic insights. The suggested approach guarantees resilience across varied and high-dimensional datasets by dynamically adjusting kernel parameters according to data properties. Extensive testing on benchmark datasets shows that, in comparison to conventional SVM and GP approaches, our model generalizability, classification accuracy, and interpretability are much improved. Autonomous systems, healthcare diagnostics, and financial sectors can all benefit from the scalable, adaptive, and probabilistic learning models that this study establishes.

AB  - Acromegaly, a chronic endocrine disorder, requires early diagnosis to prevent severe complications. Existing deep-learning-based diagnostic methods often prioritize accuracy at the expense of computational complexity and feature diversity, limiting their deployment in resource-constrained IoT environments. This article proposes Mobile Hybrid Mamba (MHMamba), a lightweight model integrating inverted residual attention convolution (IRAC) and VMamba, designed for efficient acromegaly screening on edge devices. By synergizing convolutional neural network’s local feature extraction with VMamba’s linear-complexity global modeling, MHMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance (2.8%–3.1% improvement in precision, recall, and F1-score) while maintaining ultralightweight parameters (13.882M) and low computational overhead (2.054G FLOPs). Crucially, MHMamba’s mobile-friendly architecture enables real-time facial analysis on smartphones, making it suitable for IoT-driven telemedicine and decentralized health monitoring. Through occlusion experiments and GradCAM++ visualization, we identify key facial regions (nose, mouth, and cheekbones) critical for diagnosis, aligning with clinical biomarkers. The model’s interpretability and portability position it as a pivotal tool for IoT-enabled smart healthcare systems, bridging the gap between artificial-intelligence-driven diagnostics and edge device deployment.
