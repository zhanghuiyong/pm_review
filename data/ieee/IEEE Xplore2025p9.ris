AB  - Adolescent violence is a complex public health issue with significant societal and individual consequences. Traditional research methods often fail to capture the dynamic, multifaceted nature of the cognitive and behavioral drivers of such violence. This study introduces EEG-CauseNet, an innovative Cross-Attention Transformer framework, designed to address this gap by identifying and analyzing the causal cognitive mechanisms underlying adolescent violence. The primary objective of EEG-CauseNet is to integrate and analyze diverse, high-dimensional datasets—such as socio-economic, mental health, and behavioral data—while leveraging advanced causal inference techniques to uncover complex interdependencies between factors influencing violence. Through empirical validation on real-world adolescent datasets, we demonstrate that EEG-CauseNet outperforms traditional models in both predictive accuracy and interpretability. The novel integration of cross-attention mechanisms allows the model to capture dynamic temporal-spatial relationships, offering deeper insights into the underlying drivers of adolescent violence. The outcomes of this research provide actionable insights for public health stakeholders, enabling the development of targeted, technology-driven interventions. This framework has the potential to transform digital public health strategies, offering scalable and impactful solutions to reduce adolescent violence globally.

AB  - Sentiment analysis is vital for evaluating user feedback in drug reviews because understanding patient experiences leads to more personalized treatment recommendations by providing insights into the real-world effectiveness and tolerability of medications, which are often overlooked in clinical trials. This study evaluates the effectiveness of word-level and sentence-level embeddings for feature extraction in sentiment analysis. These embeddings are used in sequential models (Bi-LSTM, CNN) and non-sequential models (Random Forest, DNN, ExtraTreesClassifier). The Random Forest model with LLM2Vec achieves the best performance, with 0.93 accuracy, F1-scores of 0.95 (positive) and 0.88 (negative), and precision scores of 0.93 (positive) and 0.94 (negative). This approach detects subtle negative feedback often missed by standard models. To capture social consensus in patient feedback, we introduce Adaptive Confidence-Weighted Scoring. This method leverages social validation as an implicit confidence signal, enabling sentiment scores to reflect both individual experiences and community agreement. It enhances trust and interpretability while standardizing sentiment polarity on a  $[-5, +5]$  scale. Clinically validated drug-related information, scraped from trusted sources, is encoded using the Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct model to extract context-aware representations. Features derived from this external medical knowledge improve semantic understanding, ensure grounding and safety, and enhance robustness even when reviews are sparse or noisy. The final vectors are employed within a cosine similarity framework to recommend relevant drugs, aligning recommendations with user satisfaction. This work demonstrates how LLM-based feature engineering can advance clinically valid, patient-aligned healthcare recommender systems informed by real-world feedback.

AB  - Arabic open question answering system (OQAS) in health informatics (HI) can promote health education and support individuals in making informed decisions. It may contribute to health education and awareness initiatives by offering precise and reliable information. It enables individuals to comprehend health-related topics, preventative actions, and treatment alternatives in their preferred language. In addition, it facilitates the accessibility of pertinent health information to a broader audience, consequently addressing language barriers. There is a limited number of Arabic OQAS in HI. Thus, this study built an OQAS using graph convolutional network (GCN) and Transformers. The author conducted data preparation and extracted named entity-relationship (NER) from raw data. A graph generator was developed to represent the NER relationship for improving the efficiency of GCN in generating a required outcome. Similarly, Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT 2.0) was fine-tuned using the Hyperband optimization. Finally, the author integrated GCN and GPT 2.0 to improve the performance of the proposed model. The performance evaluation was conducted using the MAQA dataset. The experimental outcome highlighted the importance of the proposed OQAS in healthcare informatics. The extended fine-tuning of the proposed model could improve its interpretability.

AB  - Federated Learning (FL) is an innovative distributed machine learning approach that allows multiple participants to collaboratively train a global model without sharing their private data. While effective, traditional FL frameworks often rely on centralized servers for model aggregation, making them susceptible to single points of failure, security breaches, and trust concerns. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a Decentralized Federated Learning Framework (DFLF) integrated with blockchain technology. The proposed framework eliminates the need for a central coordinator by utilizing blockchain’s immutable ledger and decentralized architecture. This integration ensures secure model sharing, verifiable updates, and incentivized collaboration among participants. Smart contracts automate key operations, including model aggregation, contribution validation, and reward distribution, thereby enhancing efficiency and transparency. The framework was implemented using a permissioned blockchain and tested on a healthcare dataset for patient diagnosis prediction. Experimental results demonstrate improved model accuracy, reduced latency, and enhanced trust compared to conventional FL approaches. The inclusion of blockchain ensures robust privacy preservation and builds trust in collaborative machine learning. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the framework, including its design, algorithms, mathematical formulations, and performance metrics. The results highlight the potential of combining blockchain with FL to establish a scalable, secure, and trustworthy ecosystem for decentralized machine learning applications.

AB  - The correct classification of brain tumors is an important factor in the early detection and treatment of neurological diseases. This paper suggests an automated deep learning-based system for brain tumor detection and classification based on CNN and YOLOv8. The data are MRI scans classified into four classes: Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary Tumor, and No Tumor. Preprocessing methods, such as normalization and data augmentation, are utilized to improve generalization of the model. Hierarchical features from MRI images are extracted by the CNN model for accurate classification, and YOLOv8 is utilized for real-time detection of tumors. Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and comparison with state-of-the-art approaches are used to evaluate performance. Interpretability methods such as Grad-Cam are also utilized to identify important regions affecting model predictions. Experimental results show that the CNN model has high classification accuracy, with YOLOv8 providing the best real-time detection. This work is an advancement toward enhancing automated tumor diagnosis and offers a robust tool for supporting clinical decision-making by radiologists. This work adds to the field of AI-based medical diagnosis by presenting a scalable and automatic computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for brain tumor classification. The designed system is of huge potential value in the field of reducing diagnostic time, enhancing accuracy, and enabling early detection, thus leading to improved patient care.

AB  - Deep learning (DL) requires large amounts of labeled data, which is extremely time-consuming and labor-intensive to obtain for medical image segmentation tasks. Meta-learning focuses on developing learning strategies that enable quick adaptation to new tasks with limited labeled data. However, rich-class medical image segmentation datasets for constructing meta-learning multi-tasks are currently unavailable. In addition, data collected from various healthcare sites and devices may present significant distribution differences, potentially degrading model’s performance. In this paper, we propose a task augmentation-based meta-learning method for retinal image segmentation (TAMS) to meet labor-intensive annotation demand. A retinal Lesion Simulation Algorithm (LSA) is proposed to automatically generate multi-class retinal disease datasets with pixel-level segmentation labels, such that meta-learning tasks can be augmented without collecting data from various sources. In addition, a novel simulation function library is designed to control generation process and ensure interpretability. Moreover, a generative simulation network (GSNet) with an improved adversarial training strategy is introduced to maintain high-quality representations of complex retinal diseases. TAMS is evaluated on three different OCT and CFP image datasets, and comprehensive experiments have demonstrated that TAMS achieves superior segmentation performance than state-of-the-art models.

It also significantly reduces the model’s sensitivity to noise data, effectively filtering out interference and providing more reliable and accurate sentiment analysis results. Moreover, it offers better interpretability to users, making the sentiment analysis process and outcomes more understandable and actionable.

AB  - The “opaque system” phenomenon inherent in deep neural networks poses significant challenges to the reliability and trustworthiness of their decision-making processes, particularly in high-stakes applications such as medical diagnosis and financial security. Current deep neural network models primarily use gradients or intermediate features to improve decision reliability, but most of the explanatory methods rooted in these features are post-hoc, with little direct influence on the classifiers’ decision outcomes. In contrast to human object recognition, where decisions and the underlying visual logic are clarified by both positive and negative causal evidence, deep neural networks often fail to achieve this level of nuanced understanding. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce a novel deep model based on Causal Interaction Attention (CIA), which aims to improve the reliability and interpretability of visual classification. Specifically, we first propose an interactive attention-driven decision mechanism that dynamically integrates visual features into the decision process, ensuring that each classifier output is accompanied by corresponding positive or negative visual interpretations. This mechanism not only explains “why this image belongs to a certain category”, but also rationalizes “why this image does not belong to other categories”, providing a comprehensive view of the model’s decision. In addition, to dynamically adapt to changes in the learning scenarios, we designed a loss function to adaptively control the strength of attention. It enhances the model to dynamically identify the most relevant visual cues, tailored to the granularity of the visual cues. The final experimental results show that the CIA can provide better visual interpretation while maintaining accuracy and reliability on small and medium-sized datasets.

AB  - Brain tumours are a critical global health challenge, accounting for 85–90% of all primary central nervous system tumours, with an estimated 308,102 new cases globally in 2020. These tumours often lead to severe physical and cognitive impacts on patients, but early and accurate diagnosis is essential for improving survival rates through better treatment planning. Current diagnostic methods rely heavily on radiologist expertise, making the process time-consuming, expensive, and resource-intensive, placing strain on healthcare systems. In this work, we aim to address this diagnostic bottleneck by developing an AI-driven solution that integrates various aspects of brain tumour diagnosis (location, type, size, shape, and severity) into one comprehensive platform. Our solution, TDA, builds on the PRCnet model (tumor type and grade classification) and XAI-MRI model (brain tumor segmentation), and offer a comprehensive system capable of predicting all tumour vital characteristics together while providing interactive interface for correction, feedback and validated learning. Experimental evaluations on different scenarios shows that our proposed framework outperforms existing models.

AB  - Early detection of arrhythmias is crucial for preventing severe cardiac events and improving patient outcomes. Traditional ECG classification methods struggle to capture complex temporal and spatial patterns in the data. While deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks show promise, they often face trade-offs between accuracy and interpretability. CNNs excel in feature extraction, and LSTMs are effective for modeling temporal sequences, but many existing models fail to capture long- range dependencies or provide clinical transparency. Exploring hybrid approaches that combine these techniques with attention mechanisms to focus on critical ECG segments remains an untapped opportunity. This paper proposes an innovative CNN-LSTM-Attention framework, which integrates the use of CNNs to extract features from ECGs automatically, LSTMs to model the sequence pattern, and self-attention on top to increase focus around critical segments of ECG signals. Besides its improvement over classification performance, the added interpretability into the working of the model opens up novel avenues for analysis. Our proposed model gives state-of-the-art performance with accuracy at 91.4%, AUC-ROC of 0.95, and other competitive metrics for precision, recall, and sensitivity on publicly available ECG datasets. Detection of a broad range of arrhythmias while at the same time providing necessary transparency makes this model perfect for real-world clinical practice. The paper gives an important idea toward developing real-time automation in arrhythmia detection with enhanced accuracy and interpretability. The proposed CNN-LSTM-Attention model breaks new ground in ECG classification, achieving high performance as well as clinical reliability and paving the way for further improvements in intelligent healthcare systems.

AB  - Lung cancer stands as one of the leading deadly malignancies across the globe which demonstrates why early identification through accurate diagnosis procedures is so important. The authors developed a learning model which combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to detect lung cancer in CT scan images more effectively. The CNN-SVM model performs better than individual models because it leverages SVM classification capabilities with CNN feature extraction abilities. The devised system received evaluation on an existing database of 8000 CT scan images which contained four distinct groups: benign, malignant, metastatic, and normal. The combination performance of CNN-SVM overstands individual models to yield a 92.3% accuracy rate with precision at 91.5% and recall at 91.7% and F1-score reaching 91.6%. The standalone CNN model reached 85.4% accuracy but the SVM model produced 78.6% accuracy. The hybrid CNN-SVM model demonstrated superior performance at all thresholds. Paired t-tests showing improvements revealed that the differences between CNN and CNN-SVM resulted in a t-statistic of -2.916 (p-value = 0.0036) and the SVM and CNN-SVM differences yielded -5.559 (p-value =3.46×10−8). oord-CAM visualization tools demonstrate how the model effectively detects essential tumor zones which enhances its clinical significance as well as its interpretability potential. The combination model of CNN-SVM demonstrates a strong and efficient approach for lung cancer detection which can find practical use in clinical diagnosis.

AB  - Successful HIV/AIDS control depends on maximizing Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) effectiveness, which enhances patient results and minimizes resistance to drugs. Understanding how each patient responds to ART is essential for developing personalized treatment plans for diverse populations with varying clinical and genetic characteristics. ARTPredict represents an innovative machine learning framework that classifies patients as ART responders or non-responders through the simultaneous analysis of clinical data and DNA sequence data. The framework uses a dual-branch neural network architecture, which processes numerical data through a Dense layer while sequence data is analyzed using an LSTM layer that includes an attention mechanism for better interpretability. Interpretability is a core feature of ARTPredict. LIME exposes the importance of numerical features and attention weights identify sequence data's role in classification decisions. Clinicians can use these insights to gain a deeper understanding of individual patient outcomes while making more informed decisions. The validated framework performance metrics, including accuracy and ROC-AUC, demonstrate that it has the potential to transform personalized ART through interpretable data-driven treatment efficacy insights. This research represents an important advancement in the field of precision medicine for HIV/AIDS treatment.

AB  - Early and accurate detection of eye diseases is essential for preventing vision loss. This paper proposes a hybrid model that combines ResNet50 for feature extraction and Random Forest (RF) for classification to improve the automated detection of retinal diseases, including Diabetic Retinopathy, Cataract, and Glaucoma. The dataset used includes 4217 retinal fundus images across four classes: Normal, Diabetic Retinopathy, Cataract, and Glaucoma. The model addresses challenges such as imbalanced datasets and complex decision boundaries. ResNet50 is utilized to extract deep features from the images, while Random Forest efficiently classifies these features with high accuracy. The proposed model achieved strong results, with Precision, Recall, Macro-F1, and Weighted-F1 scores all exceeding 92%, and a low Misclassification Rate of 7.96%. Additionally, explainable AI techniques like Grad-CAM were employed to enhance the model's interpretability, which is vital for its use in clinical settings. The hybrid ResNet50-RF model outperformed standalone models, demonstrating its effectiveness in eye disease classification. This approach offers a promising, reliable solution for automated retinal disease diagnosis and has significant potential for broader application in healthcare.

AB  - Chatbots have emerged as valuable tools in public service domains such as healthcare and education, supporting information delivery, training, and user engagement. Despite growing adoption, development practices remain fragmented. This paper presents a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of 27 studies to identify trends, challenges, and research gaps in chatbot development, focusing on technological approaches, frameworks, evaluation methodologies, and language distribution. Findings reveal a strong preference for open-source frameworks, particularly Rasa, valued for flexibility and scalability, while TensorFlow is often used for custom ML-based implementations. English dominates as the primary development language, with limited representation of Spanish, despite its global importance. Most studies apply quantitative (performance-based) metrics such as F1-score and accuracy; only one combines quantitative and qualitative evaluations, reflecting a lack of standardized assessment approaches. Additional gaps include the absence of hybrid evaluation frameworks, limited attention to Responsible AI principles, and scarce discussion on deployment requirements. Future research should prioritize multilingual chatbot models, integrate hybrid evaluation frameworks, and promote transparency to ensure scalability, ethical AI practices, and user-centered design.

AB  - In today's advancing medical diagnostics, accurately predicting stroke risk is crucial, due to the lack of effective prediction stroke remains a leading cause of global mortality and disability. Existing methods work on the linear relations of the demographic records of the subjects for stroke severity assessment. Moreover, this paper implements a novel Dual Sparse Attention Driven Neural Additive Network (DSANA) model to effectively analyze non-linear relationships through a multi-output representation, ensuring accurate prediction and capturing variability and distribution parameters (Location, Scale, and Shape), while preserving the interpretability of stroke prediction. Further, enhancement is incorporated with the concatenation of the DSANA model with Integrated Gradient (IG) for accurate stroke risk prediction and severity assessment. DSANA model is validated on the publicly available stroke healthcare dataset with 5110 patient profiles. Prediction metrics of the model demonstrated its efficacy with an accuracy of 98.54 % and a mean improvement over previous works with low-performance variance.

AB  - Acoustic foundation models, through self-supervised learning on large amounts of unlabeled speech data, can acquire rich acoustic representations. In recent years, these models have demonstrated substantial potential in audio-based health-related tasks, remarkably enhancing the efficiency and quality of healthcare services and contributing to the advancement of smart healthcare. However, there is currently a lack of systematic research and exploration on the performance of acoustic foundation models in health-related tasks. Furthermore, inconsistencies in evaluation methods and experimental setups hinder fair comparisons between different methods, severely impeding progress in this field. To address these challenges, we establish a unified Benchmark for evaluating Bio-Acoustic health via acoustic foundation models, namely BAHBench. BAHBench encompasses 6 distinct health-related tasks and evaluates 12 acoustic foundation models within a unified evaluation framework and parameter settings, enabling fair comparisons across different models. Our objective is to explore the effectiveness of current acoustic foundation models in health-related tasks. Thus, we discuss the impact of model size and data diversity on performance, and investigate feature selection and efficient fine-tuning strategy. Experimental results show that different health-related tasks benefit from features from different layers of the foundation model, while LoRA fine-tuning further enhances the model's performance on downstream tasks. Our goal is to provide clear and comprehensive guidance for future researchers. The code related to this study will be available to the research community to promote transparency and reproducibility.

AB  - Cardiac digital twins (CDTs) are personalized virtual representations used to understand complex cardiac mechanisms. A critical component of CDT development is solving the ECG inverse problem, which enables the reconstruction of cardiac sources and the estimation of patient-specific electrophysiology (EP) parameters from surface ECG data. Despite challenges from complex cardiac anatomy, noisy ECG data, and the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem, recent advances in computational methods have greatly improved the accuracy and efficiency of ECG inverse inference, strengthening the fidelity of CDTs. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the methods for solving ECG inverse problems, their validation strategies, their clinical applications, and their future perspectives. For the methodologies, we broadly classify state-of-the-art approaches into two categories: deterministic and probabilistic methods, including both conventional and deep learning-based techniques. Integrating physics laws with deep learning models holds promise, but challenges such as capturing dynamic electrophysiology accurately, accessing accurate domain knowledge, and quantifying prediction uncertainty persist. Integrating models into clinical workflows while ensuring interpretability and usability for healthcare professionals is essential. Overcoming these challenges will drive further research in CDTs.

This study evaluates the feasibility of leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for real-time misinformation detection and classification, focusing on Reddit discussions. Using logistic regression as a baseline model, supplemented by Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling and K-Means clustering, we identify clusters prone to misinformation. While the model achieved a 73% accuracy rate, its recall for misinformation was limited to 12%, reflecting challenges such as class imbalance and linguistic nuances. The findings underscore the importance of advanced NLP models, such as transformer-based architectures like BERT, and propose the integration of causal reasoning to enhance the interpretability and robustness of AI systems for public health interventions.

AB  - Investigating potential interactions between drugs and herbal medicines helps optimize combined treatment strategies and supports personalized and precision medicine. Deep learning-based methods have been successful in predicting drug-related interactions. However, these methods face challenges such as low data quality and uneven distribution. Large language models (LLMs) effectively address these challenges through their extensive knowledge bases. Motivated by this, we integrate LLMs, one-hot encoding, and variational graph autoencoders (VGAEs) to propose a herbal medicine-drug interaction (HDI) prediction model. First, LLMs are employed to extract features from drug SMILES, generating high-quality molecular representations. Second, one-hot encoding is applied to herbal medicines with multiple natural products to construct feature vectors and improve model interpretability. Finally, VGAEs are utilized to reconstruct herbal medicine-drug graphs and predict unknown HDIs. Additionally, we differentiate between herbal medicine-drug similarity and the degree of individual drug or herbal medicine nodes to mitigate the dominance of high-degree nodes in VGAE message flow. Multiple experiments were conducted to validate the significance of the proposed model and its key components. This method shows great potential for applications in traditional Chinese medicine formulation optimization, new drug development, and precision medicine.

AB  - Federated Learning (FL), which allows medical institutions to collaborate on training without disclosing raw patient data, offers a framework for cardiac disease prediction that protects privacy. FL reduces security threats and guarantees adherence to privacy laws, in contrast to conventional machine learning methods that depend on centralised data storage. FL preserves efficiency and data privacy by using the FedAvg approach to aggregate updates after training models locally. The model’s performance, which included an AUC of 0.88, 85% accuracy, 82% precision, and 88% recall, was on par with centralised methods. Important characteristics including age, cholesterol, and ECG readings were found to significantly influence predictions, which improved the interpretability of the model by providing SHAP-based justifications. This study shows that FL provides a workable Artifical Intelligence(AI) solution for diagnosing heart disease while maintaining privacy and legal compliance. In order to increase the clinical value of the model and boost confidence in AI-driven healthcare applications, future research will examine the integration of multi-modal data, scalability, and real-time updates.

AB  - Multiple instance learning (MIL) has emerged as a prominent paradigm for processing the whole slide image with pyramid structure and giga-pixel size in digital pathology. However, existing attention-based MIL methods are primarily trained on the image modality and a pre-defined label set, leading to limited generalization and interpretability. Recently, vision language models (VLM) have achieved promising performance and transferability, offering potential solutions to the limitations of MIL-based methods. Pathological diagnosis is an intricate process that requires pathologists to examine the WSI step-by-step. In the field of natural language process, the chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting method is widely utilized to imitate the human reasoning process. Inspired by the CoT prompt and pathologists’ clinic knowledge, we propose a chain-of-diagnosis prompting multiple instance learning (CoD-MIL) framework for whole slide image classification. Specifically, the chain-of-diagnosis text prompt decomposes the complex diagnostic process in WSI into progressive sub-processes from low to high magnification. Additionally, we propose a text-guided contrastive masking module to accurately localize the tumor region by masking the most discriminative instances and introducing the guidance of normal tissue texts in a contrastive way. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world subtyping datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of CoD-MIL.

AB  - Dialogue policy is a critical research area in human-computer interaction, vital for guiding dialogue generation and improving controllability and interpretability. Multi-agent dialogue policy learning demonstrates superior learning speed and exploration capabilities, positioning it as a promising approach for developing more effective and adaptive dialogue agents. However, many studies neglect to holistically model collaboration between agents, which limits the effectiveness of policy learning. Therefore, this paper proposes a new multi-agent group collaboration mechanism for dialogue policy learning, named GMPL. Concretely, we employ an Actor-Critic network to implement the proposed model, alternately updating individual dialogue agents to optimize policy selection. In each update, we utilize the maximum action value function to determine the appropriate dialogue action, while the maximum state value function serves to guide the policy learning process. This integrated approach ensures that both decision-making and learning phases are effectively aligned, thereby enhancing the overall performance of the dialogue agents. Furthermore, we conduct a theoretical analysis of the convergence properties of the proposed model. Experiments were conducted on two distinct task-oriented dialogue datasets, revealing that the proposed multi-agent model exhibits a significantly faster learning speed and a higher dialogue success rate compared to baseline approaches.

AB  - Increasing adoption of AI in public sector decision-making presents significant challenges due to the inherent uncertainties of human behavior and volatile environments. It has been suggested in prior literature that effectiveness of AI is predicted by the stability and predictability of the environment, viz., the Adapt-to-AI principle. Unlike domains such as transportation where stability can be enforced to optimize AI performance through establishing protocols, public sector domains like law, healthcare, and welfare require flexibility, interpretability, and procedural fairness. We examine how uncertainty affects AI effectiveness in the public sector, and consider whether human behaviors and environments should be adapted to improve AI utility. Using the Adapt-to-AI principle as a foundation, we propose a structured framework for analyzing AI uncertainty factors, including the intended AI user, AI subject, physical environment, and social environment. Focusing on judicial AI, we assess the feasibility and ethical implications of adapting public institutions to accommodate AI systems effectively. While some adaptations are highly feasible, adapting human behaviors and legal frameworks introduces significant ethical risks. We argue adaptations should be made to integrate AI systems from the ground up-but as a decision-support tool rather than a determinative system, ensuring human oversight remains central to public governance. Finally, we outline future research directions on adaptation strategies and governance frameworks, promoting ethical and effective AI deployment.

AB  - This work introduces a voting ensemble of AdaBoost, CatBoost, and XGBoost classifiers with feature selection using Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) to improve breast cancer diagnosis. The model employs such modern concepts in artificial neural networks to outperform conventional and single-algorithm methods in breast cancer prediction. The model trained with the medical and demographic data identified by EHRs had even higher accuracy rate of 97.90% compared to earlier models which ranged from 74.14%, to 86.6%. Due to the involvement of GWO in feature selection, the most relevant features were found to construct the model, improving its performance and enhancing the interpretability of the model as well. Due to the high model accuracy and application speed, there is a prospect of its utilization in clinical work. The results of the research create a possibility to enhance an overall number of calculations with the help of several progressive algorithms and thus, to increase the efficiency of examination and possible treatments of breast cancer. As suggested in the present study, future research in developing and validating the translation process of the model will require independent, bigger, and less homogeneous samples to test its generalizability for clinical practice.

AB  - With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has significantly improved the intelligence and efficiency of healthcare services. As a crucial component of IoMT, smart drug management facilitates efficient collaboration in drug storage, prescription management, and drug delivery. However, the drug distribution process involves multiple entities and sensitive medical data, posing serious security challenges, including patient privacy leakage, identity forgery, unauthorized access to medicines, and data tampering. To address these challenges, this article proposes a blockchain-assisted drug management and authentication scheme that integrates identity authentication mechanisms. Using the decentralization, immutability, and traceability features of the blockchain, the proposed scheme ensures the transparency and integrity of drug distribution records. In addition, the authentication and key agreement mechanism establishes a secure communication channel between patients, pharmacies, and delivery personnel, preventing unauthorized access and data leakage. The security of the proposed scheme is formally analyzed using the Real-Or-Random (ROR) model, demonstrating its robustness against common security threats. Performance evaluations indicate that the proposed scheme significantly reduces computational and communication overhead compared to existing schemes, making it a secure and efficient solution for smart drug management in smart healthcare.

AB  - Accurately predicting the length of hospital stay for patients with coronary artery disease is important for effective healthcare resource management and enhancing patient outcomes. However, to achieve a high predictive performance in machine learning, one of the key challenges is to balance exploration and exploitation during the hyperparameter tuning process. To address this challenge, this work proposes an OptiFlect Adaptive Search (OAS) optimization with XGBoost, an advanced framework designed to enhance the predictive performance of XGBoost models. Initially, data preparation and preprocessing are performed, followed by representation learning using Variational Autoencoders with t-SNE to capture complex data patterns through low-dimensional embeddings. With the transformed latent features, the proposed framework initiates a random search and then transitions to a Gaussian Process-based Bayesian optimization, employing an adaptive switching strategy to achieve an optimal balance between exploration and exploitation. The experiment is performed on three comprehensive datasets, i.e., MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, and eICU. Across these datasets, the OAS optimization algorithm achieved the best log-loss. Utilizing the optimal hyperparameters identified from OAS, the XGBoost model was retrained, resulting in superior performance with an accuracy of 97.92% on MIMIC-III, 98.99% on MIMIC-IV, and 96.58% on eICU. This model also outperformed other baseline models, achieving the highest overall and class-specific metrics, including precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, and AUPRC, while maintaining the lowest overall inference time as evaluated across nested five-fold cross-validation. The SHapley Additive exPlanations are also performed for the OAS-XGB model's interpretability by identifying crucial predictive features, helping healthcare professionals optimize resource allocation and enhance care quality.

AB  - Getting the right medical care can be extremely difficult for patients with hearing impairment. Particularly clinics in underdeveloped countries where there are budgetary limitations, a shortage of qualified service providers, and a lack of access to modern healthcare technology. Developing a multilingual dictionary for clinical use can improve the communication between healthcare providers, and hearing impaired patients. The use of medical terminology in this dictionary can reduce the misunderstandings between patients and healthcare providers. The purpose is to enhance patient care, ensure accurate information exchange. The method of creating a multilingual sign language dictionary has been demonstrated in this article. Real-time motion tracking and machine learning have been applied in this approach. The research methodology outlines not just how to develop the dictionary as a mobile application and a web application but also ways to design it user-friendly alongside how to use it for reaching as many people as possible. Preliminary studies had taken place to use it as a test program. Four key hypotheses have been examined, and their implementations are described. This research mainly highlights the importance of combining technology and accessibility to address the unique needs of the hearing-impaired community. The focus is on offering a practical solution for clinical environments worldwide.

AB  - The growing popularity of cannabidiol (CBD) has led to a surge in misinformation, particularly on social media platforms like Twitter, posing risks to public health. This paper presents a scalable method for detecting CBD-related misinformation in a large corpus of tweets. Using approximately 3.7 million tweets collected from 2011 to 2021, we implement a two-step process: first, FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) efficiently identifies tweets semantically similar to false claims extracted from FDA warning letters. Second, Mistral NeMo Instruct, a zero-shot model, classifies tweets as ‘Misinformation’ or ‘Non-Misinformation’, providing justifications for transparency. This approach minimizes computational costs while maintaining accuracy, making it a practical tool for large-scale misinformation detection. The framework is scalable and adaptable, evolving with new FDA data or emerging cannabis research.

AB  - Kidney stones are a common and impactful urological condition, with timely and accurate diagnosis being critical to prevent complications such as renal damage and avoid invasive treatments. This study explores the use of advanced deep learning models, including Vision Transformers (ViT), Swin Transformer and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)—specifically XResNet-50, VGG-16, MobileNetV2 and AlexNet—to enhance kidney stone detection from CT scan images. Leveraging a robust dataset of annotated CT scans in JPG format, the approach employs transfer learning which leverages features learnt from the ImageNet dataset to optimize model performance, focusing on classifying cases as either "Kidney Stone Present" or "Kidney Stone Absent". To further improve diagnostic reliability, the Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) identifies and localizes kidney stones within CT images, enhancing understanding of the model’s decision-making and supporting interpretability. Addressing challenges related to dataset imbalance, model interpretability, and generalizability across healthcare settings. By refining these models for kidney stone detection, the main objective of this work is to build a reliable diagnostic tool that aids in clinical judgement and treatment planning, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes and encouraging broader clinical adoption.

AB  - In this data-driven era, machine learning models face a critical hurdle: managing vast amounts of complex, high-dimensional data. These datasets, while rich in potential insights, often lead to slower computations, overfitted models, and opaque decision-making processes. To tackle these challenges, this study introduces a fresh approach using Genetic Programming (GP)—a technique inspired by natural evolution—to identify the most impactful features in datasets while boosting model performance.Breaking away from traditional feature selection methods, our framework combines dynamic feature weighting, diversity-driven population generation, and adaptive mutation strategies to iteratively refine feature subsets. Over 13 carefully designed steps, the method evolves classifiers across generations, prioritizing accuracy and simplicity. We tested this approach on eight different datasets from diverse fields like finance, healthcare, and education. The results shows that Taiwanese Bankruptcy Prediction dataset shows highest mean accuracy of 97.18% with selected features. It was also noted that both the dataset of educational field didn’t perform well, they scored the least ac-curacy score among all the datasets. Beyond numbers, this work bridges theory and practice, offering a scalable tool for researchers and practitioners to build faster, clearer, and more reliable AI systems.

AB  - The sharp rise in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) cases has become a major health concern in recent years. Accurately identifying tissue alteration regions is crucial for NAFLD diagnosis but challenging with small-scale pathology datasets. Recently, prompt tuning has emerged as an effective strategy for adapting vision models to small-scale data analysis. However, current prompting techniques, designed primarily for general image classification, use generic cues that are inadequate when dealing with the intricacies of pathological tissue analysis. To solve this problem, we introduce Quantitative Attribute-based Polarity Visual Prompting (Q-PoVP), a new prompting method for pathology image analysis. Q-PoVP introduces two types of measurable attributes: K-function-based spatial attributes and histogram-based morphological attributes. Both help to measure tissue conditions quantitatively. We develop a quantitative attribute-based polarity visual prompt generator that converts quantitative visual attributes into positive and negative visual prompts, facilitating a more comprehensive and nuanced interpretation of pathological images. To enhance feature discrimination, we introduce a novel orthogonal-based polarity visual prompt tuning technique that disentangles and amplifies positive visual attributes while suppressing negative ones. We extensively tested our method on three different tasks. Our task-specific prompting demonstrates superior performance in both diagnostic accuracy and interpretability compared to existing methods. This dual advantage makes it particularly valuable for clinical settings, where healthcare providers require not only reliable results but also transparent reasoning to support informed patient care decisions. Code is available at https://github.com/7LFB/Q-PoVP.

AB  - In recent years, facial expression-based emotion recognition has attracted a lot of interest, especially for real-time applications in fields like healthcare, security, and human-computer interaction. Image processing plays a critical role in a wide range of applications, offering enhanced capabilities for data analysis and feature extraction across various domains. A significant aspect of this project is emotion detection, where image processing techniques are applied to recognize and classify human emotions from facial expressions. To enhance accuracy and interpretability, we introduce EMOTICON, a novel method for real-time emotion recognition from video feeds that combines Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The objective is to enhance both the accuracy and interpretability of emotion recognition systems. To achieve this, we suggest comparing three distinct emotion detection configurations: (1) CNN-based emotion detection, (2) CNN and PSO for optimization, and (3) CNN integrated with Grad-CAM and PSO for enhanced performance and visual representation of the identified features. In order to improve the model's efficiency and capacity for generalization, PSO optimizes the model's parameters while CNN extracts feature maps from facial images during the training phase. By systematically exploring and applying these techniques, the project provides valuable insights into the multifaceted nature of image processing and its transformative potential in contemporary technological applications. Our tests demonstrate that CNN, PSO, and Grad-CAM collectively contribute to enhanced accuracy, which improves performance and provides interpretable insights about the model's decision-making process. The comparative analysis's findings show how effective it is to incorporate interpretability and optimization strategies into emotion detection systems.

AB  - Digital transformation of healthcare has led to widespread adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs), significantly enhancing the accessibility and efficiency of clinical workflows, administrative processes and biomedical research. Given the highly sensitive nature of patient data, ensuring its confidentiality, integrity and controlled access is paramount. However, conventional EHR systems predominantly rely on centralized storage architectures, which are vulnerable to unauthorized access, data breaches and insider threats, posing severe privacy and security concerns. To address these challenges, blockchain technology offers a promising decentralized infrastructure characterized by immutability, transparency and distributed trust. By integrating smart contracts and secure transaction logging, blockchain strengthens data provenance and enforces auditable access control in healthcare systems. Complementing this, encryption techniques are essential for maintaining confidentiality; however, traditional key generation and management approaches often lack adaptability and entropy, limiting their robustness in dynamic threat landscapes. This paper proposes a novel hybrid optimization framework that combines the Sunflower Optimization Algorithm (SFO) and Firefly Algorithm (FA) within a blockchain-enabled architecture. SFO is employed to generate high-entropy cryptographic keys, ensuring resistance to brute-force attacks, while FA models user behavior to assign dynamic trust scores, facilitating behavior-aware access control policies. The novelty lies in the integration of adaptive key management with real-time behavioral analytics, enforced via smart contracts on a blockchain network, thereby enabling proactive and context-aware privacy protection. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed system. The hybrid algorithm achieves superior entropy in key generation compared to conventional methods, over 93% accuracy in access decision-making and responsive smart contract-based re-keying triggered by trust deviations. Furthermore, the blockchain layer maintains scalable throughput and acceptable latency under varying transaction loads. Collectively, the approach offers a robust, decentralized and intelligent framework for safeguarding EHR privacy in modern healthcare ecosystems.

AB  - This study is aimed at detecting Parkinson’s disease by analyzing voice measurements made using a mobile phone. The key objectives include creating a model that ensures accurate predictions while maintaining interpretability, consistent with the existing literature on Parkinson’s disease. We introduce a novel group-wise scaling method to address typical age and biological sex biases in the datasets, demonstrating 9.5% improvement over conventional scaling for three publicly available data sets. We also show the importance of evaluating the developed model on unseen individuals to achieve reliable classification results. The developed model is shown to offer an accuracy of 82% for unseen individuals, surpassing current state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, we offer insights into the decision-making of the model using Shapley additive explanation values. Our analysis reveals that shorter and less variable voiced segments and more variable unvoiced segments, suggesting a monotone voice pattern with frequent pauses, increase the likelihood of classifying the voice as a Parkinson’s disease voice. Additionally, greater variability and rate of voiced segments, low variability of unvoiced segments, higher pitch variation, and spectral flux, suggesting continuous phonation and dynamic modulation, correlate with healthy voices. These features align well with the relevant medical literature, confirming our results. The significance of our proposed model lies in its generalizability and reliability for Parkinson’s disease detection, potentially decelerating disease progression, reducing healthcare costs, and improving quality of life for patients.

AB  - PCOS is an endocrine disorder commonly seen among women of childbearing age characterized by hormonal imbalance, irregularities in menstruation, and metabolic disorder. Early detection of PCOS helps prevent other complications such as infertility, diabetes, and heart disease. Therefore, the aim of this work is to use an attention mechanism-based RNNs for accurate and interpretable diagnosis. The sequential health data includes hormonal levels and metabolic indicators from which the model identifies patterns leading to PCOS. The mechanism of attention in the model amplifies the critical aspects of time steps, which ultimately enhances the model's performance along with providing more transparency through emphasis on the relevant diagnostic features. The model had a perfect precision, recall, and F1-score of 1.00 when tested with a PCOS dataset, indicating its reliability for transforming gynecological healthcare.

AB  - Healthcare datasets, especially those used in cancer diagnosis, often present challenges such as high dimensionality, redundancy, and irrelevant features, which can reduce the performance and reliability of machine learning models. This research proposes a robust ensemble feature selection method to address these challenges, combining Lasso Regression, Random Forest, and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE). By leveraging the complementary strengths of these algorithms, the ensemble approach aims to improve feature selection stability and enhance classification accuracy. Additionally, Shannon entropy is employed to assess data complexity and guide the feature selection process. The proposed method is applied to the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, and its performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Experimental results demonstrate that the ensemble method outperforms individual feature selection techniques, achieving higher classification accuracy and robustness in handling complex and imbalanced datasets. This study advances machine learning-based diagnostic tools by offering a reliable framework for high-dimensional medical data analysis. The findings underscore the potential of ensemble feature selection in improving interpretability, reducing computational overhead, and enhancing predictive accuracy in breast cancer diagnosis, paving the way for more effective clinical decision support systems.

AB  - Summary <p>Federated learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for training machine learning models across distributed devices while preserving data privacy. However, the decentralized nature of federated learning systems poses significant challenges in terms of security, privacy, and trust. This paper presents a novel approach to address these challenges by integrating blockchain technology into federated learning systems. The proposed blockchain&#x2010;based framework enhances the security and privacy aspects of federated learning by introducing a distributed and tamper&#x2010;resistant ledger to record model updates, data contributions, and consensus mechanisms. Through the use of smart contracts, the framework facilitates trust less coordination among participants, eliminating the need for a central authority and minimizing the risk of data manipulation or unauthorized access. Furthermore, the incorporation of blockchain technology empowers participants to maintain control over their data, granting them the ability to provide selective access to specific model parameters while keeping other sensitive information private. The immutability of blockchain ensures transparency and auditability, enhancing the accountability and verifiability of the federated learning process. In addition to strengthening security and privacy, the proposed blockchain&#x2010;based federated learning system achieves greater scalability and robustness by mitigating issues related to data distribution and device heterogeneity. The distributed nature of the blockchain network allows for efficient communication and coordination between nodes, reducing the computational burden on individual devices and optimizing the overall training process. To evaluate the effectiveness of the blockchain&#x2010;enhanced federated learning system, extensive experiments are conducted on diverse datasets and network configurations. The results demonstrate significant improvements in model convergence, accuracy, and resistance against adversarial attacks compared to conventional federated learning setups. In conclusion, this paper introduces a pioneering approach that leverages blockchain technology to enhance security, privacy, and trust in federated learning systems. By combining the strengths of federated learning and blockchain, the proposed framework paves the way for the widespread adoption of privacy&#x2010;preserving machine learning solutions in various industries, including healthcare, finance, and Internet of Things (IoT) applications.</p>

AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) are vital regulators of gene expression. They are closely linked to the development and progression of various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Their interactions form complex lncRNA-miRNA-disease networks (LMDNets), which modulate key disease-associated biological pathways. Although recent computational approaches have attempted to integrate diverse biological data such as gene expression profiles, sequence information, and disease associations. They often face significant challenges, including limited interpretability, reliance on manually curated datasets, poor scalability, and high sensitivity to noise and missing data. To overcome these limitations, we propose KHSF-LMDNet, a kernel-based Hilbert space framework for modeling lncRNA-miRNA-disease networks. This model integrates graph-based biological networks, similarity features, and deep learning with an attention mechanism to map complex interactions into a Hilbert subspace, enabling more robust and interpretable learning. Evaluated on benchmark datasets, KHSF-LMDNet consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy, precision, and area under the ROC curve (AUC). Additionally, it effectively ranks disease-associated lncRNAs and miRNAs, identifying top candidates related to cancer and Alzheimer's disease, thereby supporting functional genomics research and facilitating the discovery of novel biomarkers for precision medicine.

AB  - Medical image segmentation is essential for computer-assisted diagnosis since it allows exact extraction of anatomical structures from CT/MRI data. Traditional approaches struggle to handle medical imaging complexity due to manual feature engineering limits. U-Net's symmetric encoder-decoder architecture and cross-layer skip connections set the standard for combining local facts with global context. Subsequent developments increased its clinical utility. ResU-Net improves multi-organ segmentation with residual connections; VGG U-Net uses pretrained networks for multimodal analysis; U-Net++ uses dense nested structures for vascular segmentation; and Attention U-Net enhances lung nodule detection through attention mechanisms. These developments are driving progress in COVID-19 lesion measurement and prostate cancer grading, as indicated by BraTS Challenge benchmarks. Current problems include high annotation costs, restricted algorithmic interpretability, and computational inefficiency that impede real-time surgical applications. Future research focuses on lightweight architectures (e.g., Mobile U-Net) for intraoperative speed, Transformer integration to improve boundary precision, and self-supervised learning to reduce labeling requirements. These enhancements attempt to elevate U-Net from a segmentation tool to an intelligent decision-support system. The U-Net family speeds precision medicine adoption by eliminating computational and interpretability constraints while reducing reliance on annotated data. This includes automated lesion tracking, treatment response prediction, and individualized surgical planning. Continued innovation in hybrid architectures and efficient training paradigms will strengthen its position in next-generation diagnostic procedures, closing the gap between AI capabilities and clinical application requirements.

AB  - The rapid proliferation of AI-powered avatars in the Metaverse is fundamentally transforming user interactions through unprecedented levels of realism and personalization. However, these advances also introduce critical ethical and legal dilemmas surrounding privacy, identity theft, algorithmic bias, and data governance. This study employs a comprehensive multimethodological approach combining systematic literature review, regulatory gap analysis, and ethical framework synthesis. Our methodology integrates qualitative analysis of primary sources, comparative assessment of international legal frameworks (GDPR, CCPA, EU,AI Act), and development of a five pillar ethical framework validated through real-world case studies across educational, commercial, and healthcare Metaverse applications. Building on these insights, we propose an ethical framework emphasizing transparency, fairness, accountability, privacy by design, and user autonomy. We then examine practical solutions such as blockchain-based identity management, privacy tools, regulatory sandboxes, and global standards harmonization. Through computational simulation of representative Metaverse environments, we explore how stakeholders can apply these guidelines to balance innovation with user protection. Finally, we explore future directions, including integrating brain computer interfaces (BCIs), emotion detection, quantum-resistant cryptography, and international governance models. Validation through case study analysis demonstrates significant improvements in privacy protection metrics, substantial reduction in identity theft vulnerabilities, and marked enhancement in user autonomy controls compared to existing frameworks. Our proposed blockchain-based identity management shows effective prevention of deepfake avatar creation while maintaining high user experience satisfactio. By proactively embracing ethical and legal safeguards, we envision a Metaverse where AI-driven avatars deliver transformative experiences while upholding individual rights and societal well-being.

AB  - Simultaneously accurate and reliable tracking control for quadrotors in complex dynamic environments is challenging. The chaotic nature of aerodynamics, derived from drag forces and moment variations, makes precise identification difficult. Consequently, many existing quadrotor tracking systems treat these aerodynamic effects as simple ‘disturbances’ in conventional control approaches. We propose a novel and interpretable trajectory tracker integrating a distributional Reinforcement Learning (RL) disturbance estimator for unknown aerodynamic effects with a Stochastic Model Predictive Controller (SMPC). Specifically, the proposed estimator ‘Constrained Distributional REinforced-Disturbance-estimator’ (ConsDRED) effectively identifies uncertainties between the true and estimated values of aerodynamic effects. Control parameterization employs simplified affine disturbance feedback to ensure convexity, which is seamlessly integrated with the SMPC. We theoretically guarantee that ConsDRED achieves an optimal global convergence rate, and sublinear rates if constraints are violated with certain error decreases as neural network dimensions increase. To demonstrate practicality, we show convergent training, in simulation and real-world experiments, and empirically verify that ConsDRED is less sensitive to hyperparameter settings compared with canonical constrained RL. Our system substantially improves accumulative tracking errors by at least 70%, compared with the recent art. Importantly, the proposed ConsDRED-SMPC framework balances the trade-off between pursuing high performance and obeying conservative constraints for practical implementations. Note to Practitioners—This work is motivated by challenges in training Reinforcement Learning (RL) for autonomous navigation in unmanned aerial vehicles, but its implications extend to other high-criticality applications in, for example, healthcare and financial services. The implementation of RL algorithm policies may exhibit various deficiencies, including (i) opaque or unstable training due to the blackbox nature of deep neural networks, (ii) difficulty in reproducing RL outcomes, and (iii) heightened costs associated with robustness investigation, e.g., hyperparameter tuning and generalization. We present a novel ‘Constrained Distributional REinforced-Disturbance-estimator’ (ConsDRED) to identify uncertainties arising from aerodynamic disturbances in agile flight. The proposed algorithm demonstrates at least an optimal convergence rate for both global optimization and constraint violations. Theoretical guarantees offered by this approach can make training convergence processes more transparent and provide a degree of confidence in the expected convergence outcomes in real-world applications, thereby addressing, to a considerable extent, the deficiencies related to (i) and (ii). Our robustness investigation, related to (iii), empirically demonstrates that ConsDRED is significantly less sensitive to hyperparameter settings compared to traditional constrained RL approaches. The experiments further showcase the generalization capability of ConsDRED by introducing new and previously unseen external forces in real-world scenarios. While ConsDRED strikes a reasonable balance between performance and interpretability, there remains a trade-off with conservative decision-making. Hence, we must strike a balance between the desired degree of interpretability and the acceptable level of scalability in RL algorithms. Our proposed flight control framework evidences such a balance between high performance and safety constraints. A fundamental limitation is the computational complexity, where we sample at 16 Hz for disturbance estimation owing to limited onboard computational resources. This may be improved in the future by implementing dedicated hardware.

AB  - The insurance sector has been moving towards a more digital footing on the backdrop of growing demand for transparency, efficiency and privacy of data. The common way it is built exposes it to subtle policy checks and human intervention for claim reviews and exposes consumer data. Although blockchain technology has been explored as a possible solution, the public log nature of blockchain introduces grave concerns in privacy preservation, especially, in industries with strict regulatory requirements, including healthcare and life insurance. We propose a privacy-preserving insurance system in our paper based on ZKPs and SMPC to handle these issues. Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) enable policyholders to prove to third parties’ compliance to their policy conditions without revealing underlying information, while leveraging Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) provides insurance companies, business partners, and third-party auditors to jointly compute premium prices, validate claims, and compute refunds on privatized data inputs.

AB  - Advanced wearable sensors have enabled the continuous monitoring of physiological data under the Internet of Medical Things framework, which promotes the development of intelligent prediction technology for healthcare applications. This work concerns the problem of interpretable personalized blood glucose (BG) prediction that is crucial for diabetes management. Although encouraging results of machine-learning (ML) methods have been shown in short-term prediction, the lack of interpretability in models trained on limited data reduces the acceptance for practice use, especially for long-term postprandial BG prediction. To address this problem, a physiology-informed Gaussian process (GP) model with a neural mean function is proposed, in which the prior knowledge of glycometabolism is incorporated into the model optimization process to guarantee interpretable model learning and strengthen the ability of capturing key glucose dynamics. Besides, a model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) is utilized to enhance the model adaptability for personalized prediction. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated through the comparative results obtained by using the FDA-accepted UVA/Padova T1DM simulator and the clinical datasets. Among all the considered approaches, the proposed approach achieved the lowest RMSE on the in silico dataset, as well as in 3 and 4 h prediction on the clinical dataset. These results indicate that the proposed method has superior performance in predicting long-term postprandial BG trajectories.

AB  - Modular systems are increasingly employed in critical application domains such as healthcare, smart cities, and Industry 4.0 platforms, where dynamic integration of components poses substantial challenges in ensuring consistent and secure operation. Validating system configurations against known vulnerabilities and threats requires formal, scalable, and explainable approaches. This paper presents a knowledge-driven framework designed to support the validation of modular systems with respect to cybersecurity threats and consistency constraints. Our approach leverages domain-specific ontologies built from well-established threat and vulnerability taxonomies and encodes inference rules to automatically detect potential threats and recommend mitigation strategies. The framework, which includes a reasoning engine and a user-friendly graphical interface providing transparent and traceable explanations for each identified threat, is applied to a modular platform for privacy-preserving, decentralized processing of health data across European institutions. While this composable architecture enables multiple stakeholders to develop, deploy, and maintain specialised components fostering scalability and flexibility, it also introduces critical risks related to architectural coherence and security enforcement. In this context, our framework ensures a human-interpretable assessment of the system’s security posture, even in the presence of heterogeneous technologies and policies.

AB  - In the treatment of complex diseases, drug combination therapy is common, but drug-drug interactions (DDI) can cause severe side effects, threaten patient safety, and increase healthcare costs. Existing DDI prediction methods often focus on drug substructure features but overlook the complex interactions between them. To address this, this paper proposes the Multi-dimensional Interaction Graph Neural Network (MDI-DDI). The model combines four GraphSAGE convolution layers with a Tri-Co Attention Module. It first calculates interaction strength at the 2D level using a co- attention mechanism, then captures deeper interactions at the 3D level using a triplet structure. Experimental results show that MDI-DDI outperforms existing methods, achieving ACC, AUPRC, and AUROC of 0.9613, 0.9901, and 0.9871, respectively, on the DrugBank dataset. Additionally, the risk analysis of nitrate and nitrite drugs demonstrates the model's ability to accurately identify key functional groups, further validating its interpretability.

AB  - Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and Dementia represent critical healthcare challenges worldwide, underscoring the need for reliable and early diagnostic tools. This study presents an innovative classification framework that combines the strengths of fuzzy logic and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to enhance the detection of AD and dementia. Leveraging Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, a non-invasive and informative modality reflecting cognitive function, we propose a Fuzzy RNN model that integrates the sequential learning capabilities of RNNs with the interpretability and uncertainty handling of fuzzy logic. The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset comprising EEG recordings from individuals with Alzheimer’s Disease, various types of dementia, and healthy controls. Evaluation metrics, including sensitivity (96.49%–97.19%), specificity (96.72%–97.85%), and accuracy (97.82%–98.82%), highlight the model’s robustness in differentiating between diagnostic categories. Comparative analyses against traditional classifiers demonstrate the Fuzzy RNN’s superior ability to capture intricate temporal patterns in EEG signals, establishing its potential as a reliable tool for early and accurate dementia diagnosis.

AB  - The effective fusion of pathological images and molecular omics holds significant potential for precision medicine. However, pathological and molecular data are highly heterogeneous, and large-scale multi-modal cancer data often suffer from incomplete information. Predicting clinical tasks from such imbalanced multi-modal data presents a major challenge. Therefore, we propose a confidence-aware adaptive fusion framework CAFusion. The framework adopts a modular design, providing independent and flexible modal feature learning modules to capture high-quality features. To address issues of modal imbalance caused by heterogeneous and incomplete modal, we design a confidence-aware method that evaluates the features of each modal and automatically adjusts their weights. To effectively fuse pathological and molecular modals, we propose an adaptive deep network, which features a flexible, non-fixed layer structure that effectively extracts hidden joint information from multi-modal features, ensuring high generalizability. Experiment results demonstrate that the performance of the CAFusion framework outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, both on complete and incomplete datasets. Moreover, the CAFusion framework offers reasonable medical interpretability. The source code is available at GitHub: https://github.com/SCUT-CCNL/CAFusion.

AB  - The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) integrates interconnected medical devices and sensors to enable continuous patient monitoring and real-time healthcare delivery. Despite its transformative potential, IoMT systems face critical challenges related to data privacy, interoperability, latency, and security vulnerabilities inherent in centralized cloud architectures. Blockchain technology, with its decentralized ledger, cryptographic integrity, and smart contracts, has emerged as a promising solution to secure sensitive medical data while ensuring transparency and compliance with regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR. Concurrently, reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, especially advanced deep RL algorithms, facilitate intelligent, adaptive task offloading in fog-cloud computing environments to optimize latency, energy consumption, and resource allocation. This survey synthesizes twenty recent studies addressing blockchain-enabled privacy-preserving frameworks and RL-based task offloading mechanisms in IoMT. It critically evaluates architectural designs, cryptographic innovations including zero-knowledge proofs and quantum-resistant signatures, and RL methodologies for dynamic resource management. Key research challenges identified include the lack of standardized interoperability protocols across heterogeneous IoMT devices and blockchain platforms, the computational overhead of quantum-resistant cryptography on resource-constrained devices, and the opaque nature of RL models hindering clinical trust. Future research directions emphasize developing unified communication standards, lightweight post-quantum cryptographic schemes tailored for IoMT edge devices, and explainable RL frameworks to foster clinical adoption. Ultimately, this comprehensive analysis delineates a pathway toward robust, scalable, and secure IoMT ecosystems capable of delivering efficient, privacy-preserving healthcare services in complex digital infrastructures.

AB  - The identification of latent risk factors that can induce to health risks or an abnormal status is an important task in healthcare data analyses. In recent years, health analyses based on neural network models have been applied widely. However, such analysis processes are blackbox and the results lack explainability. Some approaches by constructing a domain model may tackle these issues. However, domain knowledge from an expert is required. In this study, we propose an exploratory and interpretable approach to estimating latent health risk factors without relying on domain knowledge, in which feature selection and causal discovery are used to construct a domain model for uncovering complex relationships in health and medical data. An evaluation experiment conducted on two datasets by comparing the proposed approach with four baselines demonstrated that the proposed approach outperformed the baselines in terms of model fitness. Furthermore, the number of model parameters in our method was smaller than that in the baselines, which reduced model complexity. Moreover, the analysis process of the proposed approach was visible and explainable, which improved the interpretability of the analysis processes.

AB  - Accurate lesion segmentation in medical imaging is critical for medical diagnosis and treatment. Lesions' diverse and heterogeneous characteristics often present a distinct long-tail distribution, posing difficulties for automatic methods. Currently, interactive segmentation approaches have shown promise in improving accuracy, but still struggle to deal with tail features. This triggers a demand of effective utilizing strategies of user interaction. To this end, we propose a novel point-based interactive segmentation model called Clustering-Aided Interactive Segmentation Network (CAISeg) in 3D medical imaging. A customized Interaction-Guided Module (IGM) adopts the concept of clustering to capture features that are semantically similar to interaction points. These clustered features are then mapped to the head regions of the prompted category to facilitate more precise classification. Meanwhile, we put forward a Focus Guided Loss function to grant the network an inductive bias towards user interaction through assigning higher weights to voxels closer to the prompted points, thereby improving the responsiveness efficiency to user guidance. Evaluation across brain tumor, colon cancer, lung cancer, and pancreas cancer segmentation tasks show CAISeg's superiority over the state-of-the-art methods. It outperforms the fully automated segmentation models in accuracy, and achieves results comparable to or better than those of the leading point-based interactive methods while requiring fewer prompt points. Furthermore, we discover that CAISeg possesses good interpretability at various stages, which endows CAISeg with potential clinical application value.

FL supports decentralized model training, avoiding data centralization risks, and DLT protects the integrity of data through immutable and transparent blockchains. MFA strengthens access control through multi-layered authentication, reducing unauthorized access risks. The suggested model performs better than existing solutions such as Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) with accuracy of 93%, efficiency of 92%, and recall of 94%. The hybrid model ensures secure, scalable, and privacy-focused predictive analytics and can be applied in healthcare, finance, and IoT-based environments. This framework provides a strong solution to improve trust, transparency, and operational effectiveness in predictive modelling in sensitive domains by resolving confidentiality issues without compromising high predictive accuracy. Optimization methods and post-quantum cryptography will be investigated in future work for further security.

AB  - So far, the communication standard development requires specific parameters to achieve the requests of the desired application, most frequently, the connection speed rate. On the other hand, the term Beyond the Fifth Generation (B5G) symbolizes certain specifications required to succeed the future-proof of the Fifth Generation (5G), i.e., the predicted high-level parameters, such as ultra-reliable low-latency communications, massive machine-type communications, and improved mobile broadband, which are essential for the expected high-level future applications; consequently, 5G wireless (cellular) networks must be reconsidered precisely and in-depth to cope with the applications' required high-level standard parameters in B5G. Therefore, it is crucial to develop novel wireless access configurations and technologies that utilize additional spectrum. However, this alone is not sufficient for now. Incorporating technologies such as software-defined networking, cloud computing, machine learning, 3D networking, and network function virtualization into B5G networks is imperative due to raised concerns regarding decentralization, transparency, interoperability, privacy, and security. This page provides a comprehensive overview of B5G's design, functionality, and security, as well as its relationship to cloud computing. Furthermore, the proposed study examines the techniques employed for data transmission in B5G applications, such as Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Device-to-Device (D2D), and Machine to Machine (M2M) transmissions. Lastly, the proposed study focuses on essential technology based software services, such as healthcare, smart grid, tourism, and agricultural services. These services use the advantages of B5G communication networks and cloud computing. So, the proposed work collects all the necessary information for researches and developers in one article, supported by the most up-to-date references.

AB  - Facial Expression Recognition is a fundamental technology for emotion analysis, mental health diagnosis, and human-computer interaction. Despite notable developments, obtaining accurate emotion classification has remained elusive owing to subtle expression changes and heterogeneous facial characteristics. In this research, a special Residual Convolutional Neural Network model called the EmotionLens, developed specifically for FER without any reliance on pre-trained models, is presented. The model is learned from scratch to categorize eight unique emotions—surprise, fear, neutral, sadness, disgust, contempt, happiness, and anger resulting in increased adaptability and feature specificity. Through extensive experimentation on the AffectNet dataset, a test accuracy of 73.96%, precision of 77.87%, and recall of 69.81% were obtained demonstrating the model's resilience for real-world implementation. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the suggested deep learning method in healthcare, affective computing, and human-centric AI systems. This research helps advance FER by providing a scalable, domain-specific design that achieves both efficiency and interpretability.

AB  - Centralized healthcare information systems face significant challenges related to security, interoperability, and real-time monitoring, particularly in the management of movement disorders. This paper proposes a novel blockchain-based framework that integrates wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs), AI-driven analytics, and the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain to enable secure, decentralized decision-making in the management of movement disorders. The system employs a voting-based consensus mechanism, where medication dosage recommendations proposed by an AI model are validated by clinicians, ensuring transparency and accountability in treatment decisions. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the framework’s scalability, achieving a throughput of 185 transactions per second (TPS) and reducing latency to 0.285 seconds under a 300 TPS load, using an 8-core CPU configuration. The proposed architecture guarantees 100% auditability and tamper-evident records, significantly improving the security and efficiency of clinical workflows. Notably, the system achieves a 96.3% reduction in latency and shows promising performance in both medication safety and treatment response times.
