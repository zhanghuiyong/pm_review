AB  - Diabetes Mellitus (DM) poses a major global health issue, impacting millions and significantly affecting quality of life. Early detection and risk prediction are crucial, but conventional diagnostic methods are often costly and limited by the availability of clinical markers. Machine Learning (ML) approaches, however, have shown higher predictive accuracy, reaching 77.9%, compared to traditional methods. This study examines ML techniques, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Logistic Regression (LR), applied to datasets encompassing lifestyle, clinical, and demographic factors. Additionally, it explores the potential of integrating ML with wearables and electronic health records (EHR) to enable personalized, real-time risk assessments. These ML models consistently demonstrate improved accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in predicting diabetes risk, with an accuracy rate of 77.9%, exceeding that of conventional diagnostic tools.

AB  - Efficient bed management minimizes hospital costs and improves efficiency and patient outcomes. This study presents a predictive hospital-ICU length of stay (LOS) framework at admission, where it leverages hospital EHR. Our work utilizes supervised machine learning classification models to predict ICU patients’ LOS in hospital clinical information systems (CIS). Our research marks the first known instance of utilizing explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) for the purpose of explainable machine learning applied to real data collected from hospital stays. We evaluated the predictive classification models using a range of performance metrics (Accuracy, AUC, Sensitivity, Specificity, F1- score, Precision, Recall and more) to predict short and long ICU lengths of stay upon hospital admission. XGBoost predicted short and long LOS with a 98 % AUC. This study shows how hospitals and ICUs might use machine learning to forecast patients on admission. Our study extends clinical information systems for hospitals to provide robust and trustworthy LOS, predictive models by using xAI to explain predictive model outputs.

AB  - Machine learning (ML) has transformed various sectors, including healthcare, by enabling the extraction of complex knowledge and predictions from vast datasets. However, the opacity of ML models, often referred to as “black boxes,” hinders their integration into medical practice. Explainable AI (XAI) has emerged as a crucial area for enhancing the transparency and understandability of ML model decisions, particularly in healthcare where reliability and accuracy are paramount. However, the reliability of the explanations provided by ML models remains a major challenge. This mainly concerns the difficulty of maintaining the validity and relevance of the new training and test data explanations. In this study, we propose a structured approach to enhance and evaluate the reliability of explanations provided by ML models in healthcare. We aim to improve the reliability of explainability by combining the XAI approaches with the k-fold technique. We then developed several metrics to assess the generalizability, concordance, and stability of the combined XAI and k-fold approach, which we applied to case studies on hypothyroidism and diabetes risk prediction using SHAP and LIME frameworks. Our findings reveal that the SHAP approach combined with k-fold exhibits superior generalizability, stability, and concordance compared to the combination of LIME with k-fold. SHAP and k-fold integration provide reliable explanations for hypothyroidism and diabetes predictions, providing strong concordance with the internal explainability of the random forest model, the best generalizability, and good stability. This structured approach can bolster practitioner’s confidence in ML models and facilitate their adoption in healthcare settings.

AB  - The progression of artificial intelligence, particularly in healthcare domain, has brought significant progress to treatment, drug discovery, disease diagnosis and more. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a scenario-based preferences risk register framework for quantifying AI related risks in disease diagnosis. Two case studies, one involving physician and the other one with involving patients as the main stakeholders, are compared to evaluate the effectiveness of the framework and to evaluate how the initiatives ranking orders will evolve based on the most and least disruptive scenarios for each cases. The framework is applied to realistic case studies on cardiac sarcoidosis, identifying success criteria, initiatives, emergent conditions, and the most and least disruptive scenarios. The success criteria align with the National Institute of Standards and Technology AI Risk Management Framework (NIST AI RMF) seven trustworthy AI characteristics. Finally, the framework identifies the most and least disruptive scenarios and the most important initiatives for both cases. Results show that Non-Interpretable AI and Lack of Human-AI Communications, Privacy Attacks, and Human Errors in Design, Develop, Measurement and Implementation are the most disruptive scenarios in both cases, however, scenario Cyber Security Threats also counted as other most disruptive scenarios to the initiatives ranked by patients. This adaptable framework has the potential not only to transfer findings to global healthcare systems but also to extend its effectiveness to various other domains, such as transportation, finance, environment, and design.

AB  - Insulin pumps and other smart devices have recently made significant advancements in the treatment of diabetes, a disorder that affects people all over the world. The development of medical AI has been influenced by AI methods designed to help physicians make diagnoses, choose a course of therapy, and predict outcomes. In this article, we thoroughly analyse how AI is being used to enhance and personalize diabetes treatment. The search turned up 77 original research papers, from which we've selected the most crucial information regarding the learning models employed, the data typology, the deployment stage, and the application domains. We identified two key trends, enabled mostly by AI: patient-based therapy personalization and therapeutic algorithm optimization. In the meanwhile, we point out various shortcomings in the existing literature, like a lack of multimodal database analysis or a lack of interpretability. The rapid improvements in AI and the expansion of the amount of data already available offer the possibility to overcome these difficulties shortly and enable a wider deployment of this technology in clinical settings.

AB  - Pregnant women might face a silent and dangerous risk known as gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). It is a disease that presents itself with high blood sugar levels and could carry devastating consequences for both the mother and the baby. Unfortunately, it often goes undetected until it’s too late, resulting in potentially life-threatening complications such as preterm birth and congenital disabilities. After thoroughly comparing and analyzing machine learning (ML) models, the Random Forest Classifier was selected with a high accuracy of 91%. Previous research works in this domain lack interpretability by incorporating explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques like Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), transparency and trust among clients and stakeholders increases by showcasing the reasoning behind each decision. This approach allows healthcare professionals to perform more accurate risk assessments.

AB  - Crowdfunding has emerged as a popular and effective means of raising funds for various purposes, from business ventures and innovative projects to educational initiatives, healthcare facilities, and social causes. However, traditional crowdfunding systems face significant challenges due to inherent vulnerabilities that commonly lead to data breaches, compromising the personal and financial information of both investors and project creators. Developing and implementing a robust AI model in real-world environments is highly challenging, as many organizations are reluctant to share sensitive information with third parties, such as project creators, due to privacy concerns. Furthermore, creating a generalized prediction model is difficult because crowdfunding participants' data is fragmented across the ecosystem. To address these multifaceted challenges, this paper presents a novel approach that leverages the strengths of blockchain and AI technologies. Blockchain technology will ensure secure data access, while AI-based federated learning will be employed to develop a robust global model for real-time use.

AB  - The rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has significantly improved healthcare outcomes, especially in ophthalmology. However, Deep learning algorithms are often called to as 'black-box' models, making interpreting decision processes difficult. The Explainable AI approach helps understand AI model predictions by explaining the decision-making process based on features. The research objective is to find the best model for classifying eye disease images through experiments using AlexNet, EfficientNetV2, and VGG19 architectures. The selected best model will be analyzed using Grad-CAM, enhancing transparency and interpretability in healthcare AI models. This study employs multi-class classification using AlexNet, EfficientNetV2B0, and VGG19 architectures to classify cataract, glaucoma, and normal fundus. Different holdout-validation techniques (70:30, 80:20, 90:10) and optimization strategies (Adam, AdamW, RMSProp, SGDM) are studied for effective disease classification. The experimental results found that the best-performing model, EfficientNetV2B0 with holdout 90:10 and RMSProp optimizer, outperformed other models in accurately classifying fundus images. The model demonstrated strong performance with high recall, precision, f1-score of 0.8969, 0.8970, 0.8969, and an accuracy rate of 89.77%. Grad-CAM analysis also identified unique features of each eye disease class, for example, cataracts. AI model is capable of detecting cataract characteristics through the level of opacity in the eye lens, underscoring its robust classification capabilities in eye disease diagnosis.

AB  - This study focuses on identifying and categorizing ocular disorders affecting critical components of the eye, including the retina, optic nerve and blood vessels, which can lead to severe outcomes such as visual impairment or blindness if untreated. In Bangladesh, where healthcare resources are scarce, especially in rural regions, early identification of ocular illnesses is crucial to avert permanent vision impairment. To address the deficiency of region-specific datasets, this research employs retinal scans from Bangladeshi healthcare facilities to develop a transfer learning-based solution. Multiple transfer learning models, including DenseNet, EfficientNet, GoogleNet, MobileNet, ResNet50, VGG16, VGG19 and ShuffleNet, have been assessed to determine the best effective architecture for eye illness categorization. A fuzzy rank-based ensemble model was proposed, integrating predictions from these models using the Gompertz function, which adaptively adjusts the weight of each model’s predictions to improve classification accuracy. The ensemble model attained an overall accuracy of $96.16 \%$, demonstrating remarkable precision for illnesses such as Diabetic Retinopathy ($99.62 \%$) and Disc Oedema ($99.63 \%$). Moreover, Explainable AI (XAI) tools like LIME have been included to improve the transparency and interpretability of the model’s decision-making process, allowing medical practitioners to comprehend and validate predictions. By providing a reliable and interpretable AIbased solution, this research significantly improves eye disease diagnosis in Bangladesh, particularly for underserved areas.

AB  - The monitoring of arterial blood pressure (ABP) in anesthetized patients is crucial for preventing hypotension, which can lead to adverse clinical outcomes. Several efforts have been devoted to develop artificial intelligence-based hypotension prediction indices. However, the use of such indices is limited because they may not provide a compelling interpretation of the association between the predictors and hypotension. Herein, an interpretable deep learning model is developed that forecasts hypotension occurrence 10 min before a given 90-s ABP record. Internal and external validations of the model performance show the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves of 0.9145 and 0.9035, respectively. Furthermore, the hypotension prediction mechanism can be physiologically interpreted using the predictors automatically generated from the proposed model for representing ABP trends. Finally, the applicability of a deep learning model with high accuracy is demonstrated, thus providing an interpretation of the association between ABP trends and hypotension in clinical practice.

AB  - Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects a significant portion of the global population. It occurs when the body cannot produce enough insulin or effectively use the insulin it produces, leading to elevated blood glucose levels. Diabetes is a major contributor to various severe health conditions, including heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, and nerve damage. Early detection of diabetes is crucial in mitigating these associated health risks and improving patient outcomes. In response to the increasing prevalence of diabetes, we have developed an automated system for Early-Stage Diabetes Risk Prediction (ESDRP). This study utilizes a dataset consisting of 16 features from 520 instances. We applied multiple Machine Learning (ML) models, including XGBoost (XGB), Bootstrap Aggregating (BAG), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Light Gradient Boosted Machine (LGBM), and Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT), both with and without feature generation techniques. Specifically, we explored polynomial and binning feature generation methods. Our findings indicate that the polynomial feature generation technique combined with XGB yielded the highest performance, achieving an accuracy of 99.22%, precision of 100%, recall of 98.15%, specificity of 99.06%, and F1-score of 100%. Additionally, all the ML models were evaluated using confusion matrices (CM) and ROC curves, with the average performance across 10-fold cross-validation demonstrating robust predictive capabilities. Furthermore, to establish trust in our model's predictions, we incorporated two explainable AI (XAI) methods: LIME and SHAP. These techniques helped us understand feature importance, the decision-making process of the models, and enhanced the reliability of our results. Our automated system aims to assist individuals of all ages and healthcare systems in identifying ESDRP, thereby supporting informed decision-making and improving global health outcomes.

AB  - Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have garnered significant attention for their potential to enhance clinical decision-making through faster and more accurate results, establishing them as a crucial research focus. The purpose of this work is to help radiologists improve patient care by introducing an effective CAD approach to distinguish between tumor and non-tumor categories in brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images. Our approach employs a novel feature fusion technique combining First Order Statistics (FOS) and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) to use both statistical and textural features. To address class imbalance, the SMOTE technique is used for dataset resampling. However, the extensive feature set may demand considerable computational resources. To mitigate this issue, feature dimensionality reduction is performed using the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) technique. Classification is then conducted using boosting classifiers with five-fold crossvalidation. With a single feature, the suggested model attains 98.30\% accuracy and area under the curve is 1. The increasing importance of AI in the healthcare industry has sparked concerns about its potential bias, lack of transparency, and explainability. By including the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value to evaluate the significance of attributes in the model's predictions, our method fixes these problems and enhances the system's interpretability.

AB  - With growing machine learning model complexity, there' is a rising need for transparent and interpretable techniques to understand their decision-methodologies frameworks, particularly in vital fields such as healthcare. This paper focuses on applying Local Understandable Model Agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) techniques to interpret predictive models for chronic cardiac disease identification, aiming to clarify the model's responses locally and globally. LIME provides local interpretability by offering insights into individual predictions, allowing healthcare professionals to understand circumstances surrounding the decision why a specific decision was made for a particular situation. In contrast, SHAP delivers global interpretability by explaining the overall behaviour of the model and its key predictive features across the entire dataset. Through extensive experimentation on clinical datasets, we evaluate the effectiveness of these methods in providing actionable insights to healthcare professionals, facilitating trust and understanding of the predictive models. Our findings contribute to advancing interpretability research in healthcare and offer valuable guidance for employing these techniques in clinical decision support systems for chronic cardiac disease management.

AB  - Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine illness that affects women worldwide and can cause serious problems like infertility and an increased risk of miscarriage. It is often caused by high androgen and male hormone levels. This hormonal disorder disrupts the menstrual cycle, leading to irregular, delayed, or absent periods. PCOS can also contribute to severe health complications, including diabetes, gestational diabetes, weight gain, and excessive body hair. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has significantly transformed healthcare, enabling advancements in both science and engineering domains. To identify the most relevant features for PCOS detection Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) is used, and several ensemble models such as bagging, boosting, voting classifiers, and stacking are compared. Among these, the Random Forest method using bagging achieved the highest accuracy. To enhance interpretability and assist medical professionals in decision-making, Explainable AI (XAI) techniques such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) are applied to the Random Forest model that offers valuable insights into the factors influencing PCOS.

Furthermore, finding reliable biomarkers is essential for achieving personalized medicine and improving patient outcomes overall. This paper presents a novel approach for multi-omics biomarker discovery in Glioblastoma using explainable artificial intelligence. The proposed method integrated data from the TCGA cohort and MOGONET's deep learning model for subtyping problems and then used the Integrated Gradients algorithm to discover important features in the multi-omics data. The identified biomarkers were subsequently validated through two approaches: first, by comparing them with established ground truth data from reference databases, and second, performance evaluation using classical machine learning models.

The review adheres to the PRISMA guidelines and explores how artificial intelligence (AI) can improve the accuracy, efficiency, and consistency of radiology reports. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and IEEE Xplore, covering articles published from January 2022 to September 2024. The inclusion criteria were studies that examined the use of ChatGPT or similar AI models in radiology reporting, specifically focusing on MRI of the lumbar spine. Studies not involving ChatGPT or AI, non-radiology-related studies, and articles not available in full text were excluded. Data extraction and synthesis were performed in line with PRISMA guidelines. A total of 18 studies met the inclusion criteria, with 12 focusing on MRI of the lumbar spine. The findings indicate that ChatGPT shows potential in standardizing radiology reports, improving diagnostic accuracy, and reducing the time needed for report generation. However, challenges such as the necessity for clinical context, risks of over-reliance on AI, and issues regarding the interpretability of AI outputs were noted. ChatGPT and similar AI models have considerable potential in radiology reporting, especially for lumbar spine MRI. However, careful implementation, continuous updates, and rigorous validation are crucial to ensure these tools enhance rather than replace the expertise of radiologists.

AB  - The robust performance of deep neural networks (DNNs) in many areas, including medical diagnosis, is not accessible from the problem of interpretability. Even though DNNs have high accuracy, they tend to operate as black boxes, usually without any explanation of which basis their predictions are made. This interpretability issue has become important, especially for high-stakes applications, such as medical image analysis and disease diagnosis, in which people’s lives are at risk. The study was structured to raise novel approaches for DNNs, internal representation translation and provide visualizations to assist medical diagnosis tasks and ensure reliable and transparent decision-making procedures. Such techniques have been developed to improve the interpretability of DNN without sacrificing the performance. The models for proposed models succeeded in the clinical tasks of medical diagnosis. They reached competitive accuracy with the best model, obtaining an accuracy of 95.7% and an F1-score of 0.914 on lung abnormality detection from chest X-rays. AUC-ROC high sensitivity and specificity of 0.963 were observed when diagnosing brain tumors based on MRI scans. These models also provided improved faithfulness perceived through saliency maps, which had an average score of 0.82, and concept activation vectors, with a consistency of 0.77 from the evaluation done by medical experts. The suggested methods offer a chance for a better patient outcome via high-precision and safe diagnostics and treatment options with an expected change in misdiagnosis rate of 10-15%.

AB  - Deep learning models have been deployed for var-ious healthcare tasks owing to their success in ingesting dif-ferent modalities of raw multimedia data. Despite the recent advancements, their widespread adoption in the critical domain of healthcare is restricted due to lack of trust in black-box models. Furthermore, the shortcomings of the existing popu-lar evaluation metrics neither incites confidence in the model predictions nor quantifies model performance capacity towards responsibility for incorrect decisions. In this paper, we propose an abstention method for Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models by quantification of the embedding space of the networks as prototypical space for each class to explain model capacity, improve performance through responsibility. The prototypical space for each class is the most confident space where the samples are correctly classified with minimal error consequently improving confidence and reliability in the model predictions. We demonstrate improvement in performance up to 18.17% and 12.10% through abstention of model outcomes by identification of outcomes which can be confidently trusted based on the prototypical spaces for each class and network architecture invariance of our proposed approach with two different 2D CNN architectures on the public MIT-BIH ECG dataset. The improvement in performance through our explainable abstaining method mitigates risk in crucial healthcare tasks and improves reliability in model predictions. We also discuss future improvements and applications of our proposed prototypical spaces in the domain of healthcare.

AB  - Humans can carry various diseases, some of which are poorly understood and lack comprehensive solutions. Such a disease can exists in human eye that can affect one or both eyes is diabetic retinopathy (DR) which can impair function, vision, and eventually result in permanent blindness. It is one of those complex complexities. Therefore, early detection of DR can significantly reduce the risk of vision impairment by appropriate treatment and necessary precautions. The primary aim of this study is to leverage cutting-edge models trained on diverse image datasets and propose a CNN model that demonstrates comparable performance. Specifically, we employ transfer learning models such as DenseNet121, Xception, Resnet50, VGG16, VGG19, and InceptionV3, and machine learning models such as SVM, and neural network models like (RNN) for binary and multi-class classification. It has been shown that the proposed approach of multi-label classification with softmax functions and categorical cross-entropy works more effectively, yielding perfect accuracy, precision, and recall values. In particular, Xception achieved an impressive 82% accuracy among all the transfer learning models, setting a new benchmark for the dataset used. However, our proposed CNN model shows superior performance, achieving an accuracy of 95.27% on this dataset, surpassing the state-of-the-art Xception model. Moreover, for single-label (binary classifications), our proposed model achieved perfect accuracy as well. Through exploration of these advances, our objective is to provide a comprehensive overview of the leading methods for the early detection of DR. The aim is to discuss the challenges associated with these methods and highlight potential enhancements. In essence, this paper provides a high-level perspective on the integration of deep learning techniques and machine learning models, coupled with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) and gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM). We present insights into their respective accuracy and the challenges they face. We anticipate that these insights will prove valuable to researchers and practitioners in the field. Our ambition is that this in-depth study and comparison of models will inform and inspire future research endeavors, ultimately leading to enhanced disease detection in medical imaging and thereby assisting healthcare professionals.

AB  - Being able to accurately predict the time to event of interest, commonly known as survival analysis, is extremely beneficial in healthcare for modeling disease progression, identifying prognostic factors, assessing risk of health by building survival models in health aging, precision medicine, supporting clinical decision making. In order to be usable by healthcare providers, survival analysis models need to be accurate, interpretable, and trustable. Efficient interaction between human stakeholders (e.g., developers, domain experts and/or end-users) and clear model interpretation not only improve the model performance but also enhance human trust. The primary goal of this paper is to develop algorithm and method that support implementation of trustworthy and time-efficient data-driven decision making for prevention and early intervention. Our experimental results on one public cancer datasets demonstrate the algorithm efficiency for predicting survival time of cancer patients.

AB  - The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is expanding fast and in all business sectors, offering and promising technical performance that exceeds human abilities. However, uncontrolled, this use can also threaten human well-being (replacement, demotivation, discrimination, dependency, etc.). In this sense, this paper analyzes the ethical risks of using AI in four diversified key business sectors: Human Resources Management, Healthcare, Entertainment and Education. From testimonials in literature, the aim of this exploratory study is to identify first the specific ethical risks for each sector and then to propose recommendations to address these ethical issues. Unethical uses of the data used and produced by AI present a variety of ethical risks that require urgent response. For instance, for the Human Resources Management sector, developing an ethical framework is recommended, promoting transparency and making public funding conditional on meeting strict ethical criteria. In the Healthcare sector, training staff involving ethics committees is suggested, as well as, developing overall guidelines, making reimbursement conditional on ethical compliance and establishing independent ethical evaluation bodies. For the Entertainment sector, recommendations include raising awareness among content creators, involving citizen ethics committees, defining an industry ethics charter and labeling AI-generated works. Finally, for the Education sector, creating AI ethics committees, is proposed requiring transparency from providers, sharing best practices, training students and ensuring access to educational data. Generalizing and systematizing the approach will be the next step in this preliminary analysis.

AB  - A major cause of illness and mortality on a global scale is Cardiovascular Disease (CVD). Ensuring timely response and efficient management requires precise risk prediction. This study rigorously examines the use of support vector machines (SVM) and other advanced machine learning algorithms to opti-mize cardiovascular risk prediction. The authors have obtained a comprehensive dataset comprising patient gender analysis, patient behavior, and medical history parameters from a diverse patient cohort. The dataset has been meticulously preprocessed to impute missing values and accurately welcome and encode attributes. There were multiple machine learning models that were utilized, including SVM, random forest, and XG boosting, to forecast the likelihood of future cardiovascular events. This study’s key contributions include: (1) developing an optimized SVM model for cardiovascular risk prediction that outperforms traditional methods, (2) comprehensively comparing multiple advanced machine learning algorithms, and (3) introducing a novel approach to handling imbalanced data in cardiovascular risk assessment. The results unequivocally demonstrate that SVM, with its kernel technique and margin optimization, delivers superior performance in accuracy, precision, and recall compared to traditional logistic regression models. Ensemble methods such as Random Forest and XG Boosting are essential for managing imbalanced data and performing thorough feature importance analysis in data science and machine learning. This will enable doctors to easily understand each feature in predicting risk. In conclusion, the integration of machine learning algorithms, especially SVMs, into cardiovascular risk prediction frameworks can significantly enhance their predictive power. These advances have the potential to revolutionize CVD risk stratification and pave the way for personalized medicine, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

AB  - Melanoma is a severe form of skin cancer that requires early detection for effective treatment. This study explores the use of advanced AI techniques to enhance the accuracy of melanoma diagnosis. We proposed a hybrid VGG-SVM model that incorporates GAN-based data augmentation to enhance the training process. Additionally, we used LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to gain insights into the model's decision-making. By training on large datasets of dermatoscopic images, our method aimed to detect subtle melanoma characteristics with high accuracy while maintaining explainability. The proposed VGG-SVM model, combined with LIME, achieved an accuracy, precision, and F1-score of 96%, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. This significant improvement in both accuracy and interpretability addresses a critical scientific gap in AI-assisted melanoma diagnosis, potentially enhancing early detection rates and clinical trust in AI systems. Our study demonstrates the potential of hybrid AI models in medical image analysis and highlights the importance of interpretability in clinical applications. Future work will focus on clinical validation and exploration of transfer learning techniques to further improve model performance across diverse patient populations.

AB  - This paper presents a human activity recognition framework tailored for healthcare applications, emphasizing the essential balance between accuracy and interpretability required for medical monitoring. The model utilizes MediaPipe to capture the complex dynamics of human movements and introduce an interpretable feature reduction function. This method improves traditional dimensionality reduction techniques like principal component analysis. Our feature engineering is based on the importance of feature permutations; it selectively retains salient features, thus enhancing the interpretability essential for the medical domain. We validated our method on the “NTU RGB+D” dataset; it improves the recognition accuracy for a range of human activities that may be relevant for elderly care. However, the recognition of subtler activities like neck pain and headaches requires further investigation. This study underscores the potential to advance patient monitoring and sets the stage for its expanded application in various medical contexts.

AB  - Otitis Media (OM), predominantly affecting children, is a significant global health issue, with an estimated 360 million pediatric cases yearly worldwide. OM causes mild and moderate conductive hearing loss which can be disabling for young children, particularly during the first three years of life when brain growth is rapid, resulting in poor speech and language development, poor communication skills, and increased vulnerability on entering school. OM therefore contributes to the global burden of all-cause hearing loss. This systematic review seeks to provide a comprehensive evaluation of pre-trained Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, including both classical Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), in the context of OM. This review proposes six research questions, and it summarizes the body of research across multiple domains, including the diversity and quantity of source material for training and testing models, including otoscopy images, videos, and tympanometry, and the methods used to assess quality and effectiveness in real-time settings. In addition, the review aims to provide insight into the impact and potential of AI in improving OM diagnosis and cast light on the existing challenges, such as model interpretability, limited medical expert involvement, and the need for knowledge discovery and unanswered questions, including the evolving landscape of OM diagnosis within this domain. The findings of this systematic review emphasize the importance of developing more interpretable AI models that incorporate both still images of the tympanic membrane and video recordings (with multiple frames) to maximize sensitivity and specificity of the model. In addition, collaboration with consumers and medical professionals in multiple specialties (general practice, pediatricians, audiologists and ear, nose, throat (ENT) surgeons) is needed to ensure applicability and confidence of these diagnostic digital support systems in real-world healthcare settings.

AB  - Obesity is a significant health concern linked to severe medical conditions. Obesity increases the risk of diabetes, thyroid issues, cardiac disease, liver tumors, and stroke. Early prediction of obesity risk is essential for improving public health and well-being. To address this, an optimized explain-able CatBoost model, referred to as OptiX-CatBoost, has been developed. Initially, various machine learning (ML) models are trained using the publicly available dhaka obesity dataset. Among these, the categorical boosting (CatBoost) model emerged as the top performer and is selected for optimization. Bayesian optimization is employed to fine-tune key hyperparameters of the CatBoost model, enhancing its performance. The experimental results demonstrated that the OptiX-CatBoost model outperformed existing methods, achieving an accuracy of 95.60%, a precision of 94.60%, a recall of 93.12%, an F1-score of 98.15%, a Jaccard score of 96.14%, and a Kappa score of 87.14%. Additionally, the predictions made by the proposed model are further analyzed using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques. Healthcare professionals can evaluate the predictions of the proposed model and learn more about the different factors driving obesity by using XAI techniques such as partial dependence graphs, permutation significance, and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations). This dual capability of accurate prediction and interpretability renders OptiX-CatBoost a valuable tool for early obesity risk assessment, ultimately aiding in the development of better public health strategies and interventions.

AB  - Pregnancy complications in the early months of the family process can lead to miscarriage. Miscarriage does not occur due to only one reason; many factors are involved in causing miscarriage. Deep Learning (DL) can help healthcare providers by providing advanced analysis. In this study, we have proposed two novel ensemble models, Echo Dense Inception Blending (EDI-Blend) and Dense Reservoir Inception Modular Network (DRIM-Net), for miscarriage prediction. The dataset is balanced through the use of the hybrid balancing technique NearSMOTE. As the dataset is high-dimensional, we have used the Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator to select essential features from the dataset that significantly impact pregnancy complications. We validate the output of our proposed EDI-Blend and DRIM-Net models using 10-Fold Cross Validation. To determine the contribution of features for miscarriage prediction two eXplainable Artificial Intelligence techniques are applied to EDI-Blend and DRIM-Net: Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations and SHapley Additive exPlanations. We have compared our proposed EDI-Blend model with base models, and the results show that EDI-Blend model performance is more efficient, with 0.732 accuracy, 0.721 recall, 0.732 F1-score, and 0.721 Receiver Operating Characteristic-Area Under the Curve (ROC-AUC). The DRIM-Net model is also compared with baseline models and achieves 0.768 F1-score, 0.764 precision, 0.769 accuracy, 0.769 recall, and 0.837 ROC-AUC.

AB  - Racial bias in artificial intelligent (AI) systems is a pervasive problem that undermines fairness and perpetuates inequality. This paper presents an analysis of bias-mitigating algorithms applied to standard machine learning classifiers with the goal of reducing racial bias in healthcare access. The study integrates Reweighing, Adversarial Debiasing, and Exponentiated Gradient (with demographic parity) methods with two base classifiers: Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier. The evaluation framework employs both traditional predictive performance metrics—accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score—and fairness metrics, including average odds difference, disparate impact score, equal opportunity difference, and balanced accuracy. The study finds that after the application of bias-mitigating algorithms, the Random Forest Classifier augmented with the Reweighing algorithm is the superior model, achieving an accuracy of 88.01%, precision of 89%, recall of 97%, and F1 score of 93%, while also demonstrating a balance with respect to fairness. This indicates the model's capability to maintain equity across diverse racial groups and the Random Forest Classifier model's compatibility with the Reweighing technique. The model was then interpreted using Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations to offer clear insights into the decision-making process. By highlighting effective strategies for mitigating racial algorithmic bias and fostering interpretability, this paper contributes foundational knowledge crucial for ethical AI development in the healthcare sector.

AB  - Diabetes is a significant cause of death globally. People with diabetes are more susceptible to infections, possibly due to problems with their immune system. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a disorder characterised by insufficient insulin production or ineffective utilisation of insulin, leading to elevated blood glucose levels. Timely identification of diabetes is essential for efficient control and therapy. Conventional techniques depend on intrusive blood testing, however recent advancements indicate that salivary enzymes can be used as non-invasive indicators. Using saliva for diagnosis is promising because collecting saliva is simple, doesn’t require invasive procedures, and is less technically demanding than drawing blood. Saliva is a special liquid that plays a crucial role in the mouth’s normal functioning. Detecting diabetes through blood tests can be challenging in certain groups like children, older adults, and those who are sick or weakened. This study introduces an improved framework for predicting diabetes by combining salivary enzymes with advanced machine learning algorithms and ensemble learning. To improve the model’s comprehensibility, we employed the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) technique, which is a component of explainable AI (XAI). Multiple machine learning models are assessed using the Diabetes dataset, which comprises data from 300 patients. Simulation results reveal that XGBoost attains the maximum accuracy of 89% and elucidates the causes and variables contributing to diabetes, thereby assisting medical practitioners in decision-making for clinical diagnosis and treatment strategies.

AB  - Skin is the largest organ that acts as a primary defense system of the human body. Yet, every year, 3.5 million people are affected by skin cancer across the whole world, and the numbers are continuously rising. Only accurate and early diagnosis can help mitigate the complications of this life-threatening global concern. However, the traditional method alone fails to meet such requirements. On top of that, most of the skin of the human body is covered with hair, which hinders the visibility of lesions. As a result, the correctness of diagnosis is reduced. In this study, the skin image clarity has been enhanced using several image enhancement techniques. Furthermore, a deep learning model named MelaNet50, which is inspired by the architecture of ResNet50, has been introduced for early and accurate diagnosis of skin cancer. The proposed MelaNet50 model exhibits good performance metrics when compared to the previous studies conducted on the same topic. Finally, two prominent Explainable AI (XAI) techniques have been integrated with the 94.7% accurate MelaNet50 model to convey the region of interest within the images, based on which the proposed DL (Deep Learning) model is classifying the images. Hence, this study presents an enhanced and trustworthy computer vision-based decision support system for healthcare specialists for early and error-free diagnosis.

AB  - Healthcare is being altered by machine learning for early sickness prediction and diagnosis. Based on patient symptoms, Random Forest, an ensemble machine learning algorithm, will predict diabetes, heart attack, cancer, TB, arthritis, lung disease, stroke, asthma, brain tumor, osteoporosis, COPD, and oral disease. A comprehensive dataset of patient records, symptoms, and sickness outcomes is curated to start the research. We manage missing data, encode category variables, and normalize numerical features. For accurate sickness prediction, feature selection methods identify the most essential symptoms and clinical traits. On the preprocessed data, a Random Forest classifier is trained to handle complex feature interactions without overfitting. Model performance is improved via hyperparameter tuning, and many measures are employed to ensure forecast accuracy. In addition to sickness prediction, the research analyzes feature importance to identify key symptoms and covariates. This may assist doctors understand disease start and progression. Health care providers utilize the final model to predict illnesses in real time using patient symptoms. We will regularly evaluate and update the model to incorporate new medical knowledge and data. Patient data privacy, ethics, and compliance with healthcare data laws and standards are paramount. The effort seeks unbiased, transparent, and prejudice-free disease prediction to ensure equitable healthcare results.

AB  - The lungs are vital organs essential for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide, and their health is critical for sustaining life. Chest X-rays are a key non-invasive tool for assessing lung health, enabling the identification of abnormalities such as pulmonary infiltrations, which appear as opaque areas in radiographs and may signal underlying diseases. Early detection of such abnormalities is essential for timely intervention and disease management. Artificial intelligence (AI) has recently emerged as a valuable tool for analyzing large volumes of medical data and producing accurate predictions. However, the black box nature of deep learning models poses challenges in interpretability, limiting their adoption in critical domains like healthcare. To address these issues, this study introduces a three-level explainable framework using Grad-CAM, LIME, and SHAP techniques to enhance the interpretability of AI-driven solutions. The used methodology involves an in-depth analysis of classification results, through explainable AI techniques to tackle challenges such as medical artifacts, naturally present in X-ray images. This dual perspective combines clinical relevance with technical rigor to ensure actionable insights. The study highlights the complexities of applying AI to this domain while providing a comprehensive, explainable analysis, offering a foundation for improving both diagnostic accuracy and trust in AI systems. Future research directions are also discussed, emphasizing the importance of advancing explainable solutions in medical AI applications.

AB  - Adopting AI models in the healthcare system is often impeded by concerns over the lack of transparency and interpretability. In our study, we address this challenge of black box nature and explain it through explainable AI (XAI) techniques— SHAP, GRAD-CAM, and LIME. We employed pre-trained VGG16 and VGG19, which are considered black box models, and used the latter XAI techniques to explain the following model’s black box nature by identifying the critical pixels or superpixels in brain MRI images that significantly influence the model’s decision-making. Our analysis featured the XAI algorithms’ behavior when applied to the models and how the different behavior of the XAI helps enhance model interpretability, particularly investigating how the extra convolution layer in the VGG network affects the behavior or effectiveness of the explainable AI algorithms. Also, we address higher performance metrics, such as accuracy, which do not necessarily equate to the black box model’s ability to correctly identify relevant pixels in the classification. The ascendancy of VGG19 over VGG16 in terms of zeroing in on the critical pixels and the effectiveness of the XAI techniques are further explained through counterfactual explanation. Analysis of the highlights and counterfactual explanations among the XAI techniques presents SHAP as the most effective XAI.

This paper presents an overview of the current landscape of LLMs in healthcare, specifically focusing on their applications in analyzing and generating conversations for improved patient engagement. We showcase the power of LLMs in handling unstructured conversational data through four case studies: (1) analyzing mental health discussions on Reddit, (2) developing a personalized chatbot for cognitive engagement in seniors, (3) summarizing medical conversation datasets, and (4) designing an AI-powered patient engagement system. These case studies demonstrate how LLMs can effectively extract insights and summarizations from unstructured dialogues and engage patients in guided, goal-oriented conversations. Leveraging LLMs for conversational analysis and generation opens new doors for many patient-centered outcomes research opportunities. However, integrating LLMs into healthcare raises important ethical considerations regarding data privacy, bias, transparency, and regulatory compliance. We discuss best practices and guidelines for the responsible development and deployment of LLMs in healthcare settings. Realizing the full potential of LLMs in digital health will require close collaboration between the AI and healthcare professionals communities to address technical challenges and ensure these powerful tools’ safety, efficacy, and equity.

AB  - Background Diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are two major causes of death in the United States. Therefore, accurately predicting the likelihood of cardiovascular disease in diabetic patients and identifying high-risk individuals is of great importance. Methods and Results Our sample includes 1,080 adult diabetic patients from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey dataset in the United States, with ten features such as gender, age, body mass index(BMI), history of hypertension, and history of high cholesterol. This paper develops a new deep learning framework that addresses the common issue of sample imbalance in the medical field. A Attentive Interpretable Tabular Learning model(TabNet) was constructed to predict the risk of cardiovascular disease in individual diabetic patients, achieving an accuracy of 0.74 and an AU-ROC value of 0.804. SHapley Additive exPlanations methods(SHAP) were used to assess the risk factors for cardiovascular disease in diabetic patients, identifying waist circumference, age, and body mass index as the top three influencing factors. Conclusion Deep learning methods have great applicability and high accuracy in predicting cardiovascular disease risk in diabetic patients. Elderly and obese diabetic patients, especially those with abdominal obesity, are at high risk for cardiovascular disease. Diabetic patients with a history of high cholesterol also face an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

This study explores the application of machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict B.Sc. Nursing placement outcomes, aiming to optimize workforce management and graduate placement efficiency. Traditional placement methods often suffer from subjectivity and inefficiency. Leveraging historical placement data and relevant features, ML algorithms discern patterns to forecast individual placement likelihood accurately. Various ML techniques including logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and ensemble methods are employed and evaluated for their predictive efficacy. The CN2 rule inducer model emerges as the top-performing model, demonstrating superior discriminatory ability and accuracy. These findings offer significant implications for nursing education institutions and healthcare organizations, facilitating better alignment of education with workforce demands.

AB  - The examination of bacterial communities has increasingly relied on machine learning methods and metagenomic analysis, providing novel solutions across various domains. However, the restricted size of metagenomic datasets presents challenges for robust model training. Consequently, data augmentation techniques, such as Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks (CTGAN), have obtained attention. This study seeks to utilize machine learning algorithms, incorporating CTGAN, to assess the influence of microbial community composition on the growth patterns of Clostridium bacteria in metagenomic dataset. Additionally, the study employs SHAP analysis to explain feature importance and contrast model performance pre- and post-data augmentation. The findings demonstrate notable enhancements in classification metrics subsequent to data augmentation, particularly evident when excluding the “Day” feature. Moreover, SHAP analysis identifies pivotal features, notably the absence of the “Day” variable post-CTGAN synthesis, emphasizing the significance of specific bacterial genera like Clostridium in bacterial growth dynamics. Overall, this study underscores the efficacy of data augmentation techniques, specifically CTGAN, in enhancing machine learning model performance for metagenomic data classification tasks, with implications for refining food safety and healthcare protocols. Further research could explore advanced data augmentation methodologies and validate outcomes on more expansive datasets for practical implementation.

AB  - Safety-critical applications such as healthcare and autonomous vehicles, utilize machine learning (ML), where mispredictions could have disastrous consequences. Training data can contain faults, especially when collected through crowdsourcing. Ensembles, consisting of multiple ML models voting on predictions, have been found to be an effective resilience technique. Ensembles are resilient when their constituent models behave independently during inference, by focusing on different features in an input. However, independence is not observed on every input, resulting in mispredictions. One way to improve ensemble resilience is to dynamically weigh predictions during inference by its constituent models instead of treating each model equally. While previous work on dynamically weighted models in ensembles has relied upon output diversity metrics due to efficiency, we focus on the feature-space of inputs for accuracy. Hence, we propose the use of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques to dynamically adjust the weight of ensemble models based on local feature-space diversity.

AB  - Deep learning models have been prominently applied for the automatic detection of various cardiovascular conditions using ECG signals. The concept of explainable artificial intelligence is all about finding whether the deep learning framework has captured the appropriate characteristics for the detection task instead of learning some unsolicited approaches (learning features that do not reflect the properties of the instance being classified). So that the health care professionals who use the artificial intelligence system can be confident about the diagnosis obtained from the model. In this chapter, we establish an explainable artificial intelligence method through the multi-label ECG classification. Our proposed method employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained using 2D matrices constructed from various leads of ECG recordings. In this work, we show that training the CNN with only a single label per ECG recording is sufficient for the CNN to capture the characteristics of multi-label ECG points. The proposed model when tested with ECG signals containing multi-label information was found that the output probabilities of the correct labels obtained from the softmax layer are in the same order of magnitude. This leads to an explainable framework of how the proposed network correctly gets activated when it sees multiple features pertaining to different heart diseases in the same ECG signal despite having trained only with a single label for each ECG recording. This establishes the fact that the CNN has captured the correct features for the categorization of ECG instead of some undesirable features which are local to our dataset. Further, thresholding is applied to the probabilities from the softmax layer of the proposed CNN, leading to the multilabel categorization of ECG containing up to two labels. The number of ECG records in the training and test set is 6,311 and 280, respectively. The proposed model is evaluated with common performance metrics analyzed in the multi-label classification problem. The model achieved the following scores in different metrics considered: subset accuracy - 0.962, hamming loss - 0.037, precision - 0.986, recall - 0.949 and F1-score - 0.967. Thus, our proposed model is an explainable artificial intelligence-based approach for the multi-label classification of ECG recordings of patients which can be used for computeraided diagnosis of heart diseases confidently.

AB  - Over the years, several frameworks have been proposed in the domain of Explainable AI (XAI), however their practical applicability and utility need to be clarified. The neighbourhood contexts are shown to significantly impact the explanations generated by XAI frameworks, thus directly affecting their utility in addressing specific questions, or “explananda”. This work introduces a methodology that use a comprehensive range of neighbourhood contexts to evaluate and enhance the utility of specific XAI techniques, particularly Feature Importance and CounterFactuals. In this evaluation, two explananda are targeted. The first one examines whether features' collection should be halted as per the AI model based on the sufficiency of the current set of information. Here, the information refers to the features present in the data used to train the AI-based system. The second one explores what is the most effective information (features) that should be collected next to ensure that the AI outputs the same classification as it would have generated with all the information present. These questions serve as a platform to demonstrate our methodology's ability to assess the impact of customised neighbourhood contexts on the utility of XAI.

AB  - Accurate and timely diagnosis of skin lesions is crucial for effective treatment. This research proposes a novel hybrid model that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Random Forests (RFs) to improve the classification of skin lesions. The CNN component extracts relevant features from dermoscopic images, while the RF classifier categorizes these features into different skin lesion types. The hybrid model benefits from the strengths of both techniques, integrating the feature extraction capabilities of CNNs and the robust classification performance of RFs. The proposed model achieved a high accuracy of 94%, surpassing the performance of individual CNN and RF models. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the hybrid approach in accurately classifying skin lesions, contributing to early detection and appropriate treatment. This research has significant implications for dermatology, offering a potential solution to improve diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.

AB  - Pneumonia is one of the major health problems to be faced throughout the world and has always hit the most vulnerable groups of populations-children, older adults, and those with other health conditions. The medical diagnosis, often CXR-based, faces errors due to limitation in image quality, radiologists’ fatigue, and human mistakes. This paper proposes the cascaded deep CNN pipeline along with Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to effectively detect pneumonia from CXR images. In this regard, there is a dataset of 2,023 labelled CXR images that were collected from a diagnosis clinic in Pabna of Bangladesh. The images were pre-processed using different pre-processing techniques such as CLAHE and noise-reduction filters for improving the quality of the images. From these pre-processed images, several pre-trained CNN architectures were then applied in extracting features: ResNet50, Xception, and InceptionV3, which were furthered with LR and XGB. Precisely, the best performance could be observed in models like ResNet50 with LR, which yielded 97.86% average accuracy, and Xception with XGB, yielding up to 98.02%. With this in mind, the model used techniques such as Grad-CAM to visualize the region of interest in CXR images for better transparency and interpretability of the model. This study thereby shows that a combination of CNNs with suitable classifiers and explainable AI techniques is a trustworthy and computationally efficient solution for pneumonia screening. This framework will be extended for other pulmonary diseases very soon and then validated in real-time clinical settings.

The dataset used was obtained from Kaggle which contained 11 columns and 583 rows, amongst which there were 142 females and 441 males. The dataset contained various features which helped our model to do better predictions. We have used Machine Learning algorithms for the purpose which included classification algorithms like Random-Forest, Logistic-Regression, Decision-Tree, SVM, KNN. The results obtained from all these classifiers were then given to an ensemble model to arrive at exceptional results. In the paper below we obtained the highest accuracy using Random Forest classifier which gave us a result of 72%. We have then used LIME & SHAP kernels. SHAP kernels allowed us to explain the underlying decision-making-process in a better way, it also enhanced the interpretability and trustworthiness of the models. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the ML models and their contribution to the field of liver disease diagnoses and prediction.

AB  - This paper explores the integration of machine learning (ML) techniques with magnesium-based biomedical applications, focusing on predictive modeling and personalized treatment strategies. Magnesium's biocompatibility and biodegradability make it an attractive material for various medical applications, including implants and drug delivery systems. However, optimizing its use for individual patients remains challenging. In this paper it is proposed that ML can bridge this gap by enabling more accurate predictions of treatment outcomes and facilitating personalized approaches. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and analysis of case studies, it is demonstrated that how supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and deep learning techniques can be applied to improve patient outcomes in magnesium-based treatments. The paper also addresses challenges such as data privacy and model interpretability, proposing solutions for integrating ML into clinical workflows. Our findings suggest that the synergy between ML and magnesium-based biomedical applications has the potential to significantly advance personalized medicine, opening new avenues for research and clinical practice.

AB  - Deep Learning models are automating many daily routine tasks, indicating that in the future, even high-risk tasks will be automated, such as healthcare and automated driving areas. However, due to the complexity of such deep learning models, it is challenging to understand their reasoning. Furthermore, the black box nature of the designed deep learning models may undermine public confidence in critical areas. Current efforts on intrinsically interpretable models focus only on classification tasks, leaving a gap in models for object detection. Therefore, this paper proposes a deep learning model that is intrinsically explainable for the object detection task. The chosen design for such a model is a combination of the well-known Faster-RCNN model with the ProtoPNet model. For the Explainable AI experiments, the chosen performance metric was the similarity score from the ProtoPNet model. Our experiments show that this combination leads to a deep learning model that is able to explain its classifications, with similarity scores, using a visual “bag of words”, which are called prototypes, that are learned during the training process. Furthermore, the adoption of such an explainable method does not seem to hinder the performance of the proposed model, which achieved a mAP of 69% in the KITTI dataset and a mAP of 66% in the GRAZPEDWRI-DX dataset. Moreover, our explanations have shown a high reliability on the similarity score.

AB  - The capacity to anticipate and get ahead of potential cyber attacks is of the utmost importance in the constantly shifting world of cybersecurity. When it comes to combating the continually evolving strategies employed by cybercriminals, traditional remedial security measures frequently prove to be ineffective. Within the scope of this study, the application of predictive analytics, with a particular emphasis on deep learning techniques, is investigated with the purpose of improving the detection and mitigation of cybersecurity risks. Through the utilisation of the power of deep learning algorithms, our objective is to create a proactive cybersecurity framework that is capable of predicting and responding to potential risks before they become actual dangers. A complete analysis of the current cybersecurity threat landscape is the first step in this research. This analysis takes into account the variety and sophistication of assaults, such as malware, phishing, and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. After that, we take a look at the current state of the art in predictive analytics and deep learning, analysing how these technologies have been utilised in a variety of fields to make predictions about patterns and trends. In this paper, we offer a unique prediction model that is based on deep learning and has the capability to analyse enormous volumes of network data in order to identify unconventional activity and anticipate probable security breaches. In order to capture both the geographical and temporal characteristics of cyber threats, the model incorporates a number of different deep learning architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Our approach is validated by conducting extensive experiments with real-world cybersecurity datasets. This allows us to demonstrate that our approach is effective. According to the findings of our study, the suggested model is capable of achieving a high level of accuracy in forecasting cybersecurity threats, beating both conventional machine learning models and the predictive analytics tools that are already available. In addition to this, we highlight the significance of our findings for the creation of proactive methods for cybersecurity. Deep learning has the ability to switch cybersecurity from a reactive to a predictive discipline, which would allow organisations to stay one step ahead of cybercriminals. This research highlights the potential of deep learning to accomplish this transformation. In conclusion, the findings of this study highlight the significant role that predictive analytics and deep learning play in determining those who pose a threat to cybersecurity. By embracing these advanced analytics techniques, the cybersecurity community will be able to better secure digital assets and maintain the integrity of information systems in the face of cyber threats that are becoming increasingly complex.

AB  - cardiovascular disease is the leading disease globally, and hypertension, diabetes, among other lifestyle factors contribute to it. Traditional diagnostics mainly focus on retrospective biometric assessment; such diagnostics will not offer sufficient prediction capabilities for proactive management without invasive procedures. In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based risk stratification from noninvasive, age-based assessments aiming at early detection of cardiovascular disease risks in asymptomatic people. This was made possible by leveraging a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle that was used in evaluating different models of ML over the given data with high emphasis laid on logistic regression because, unlike random forest and KNN models, this has exemplary predictive capability. In summation, what this piece of research is able to contribute is an identification of a good non-invasive robust predictive approach that’s likely to be applied for use in the clinical space in improving effectiveness in earlier intervention as well as that of patients’ outcome.

AB  - Generating textual interpretability using recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for enhancing the efficiency of comprehensive computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems. This improves transparency between medical staff, intelligent CAD systems, and end-users by creating a trustworthy and effective intermediate medical diagnosis environment. In this paper, an innovative explainable throughout CAD system is introduced, designed to predict diseases from Chest X-rays (CXR) in a comprehensive scenario. The primary goal is to undertake multiple tasks that reduce the burden on medical staff and enrich CAD outcomes, including classification, visual explanations (heatmaps), and textual report generation. The proposed CAD system is developed through eight key steps: Data Collection and Annotation, Data Preparation, Text Vectorizations (Indexing), Visual Encoder, RAG-Fusion, Structural Prompt, XAI LLmTextual Reasoning (LLM Model), and Final Output (LLM textual report, image classification, and heatmap localization). The AI-based CAD system is trained and evaluated using the public benchmark MIMIC-CXR dataset with 14 different classes. The classification performance achieved an overall accuracy of $70 \%$, precision of $70 \%$, and F1-score of $0.60 \%$, while for text report generation, the system obtained an average BERTScore precision of 0.83, RougeL 0.16, and a Meteor score of 0.28. These promising results suggest the potential for further improvement of the CAD system and its applicability to real-world medical tasks.

AB  - Because cardiovascular disease (CVD) is still one of the world’s leading causes of death, sophisticated predictive models are required for early detection and prevention. This study examined how to make and compare different CVD prediction models using a large dataset that included biochemical, clinical, and demographic information about each person. During the preprocessing stage, we took great care to ensure the data’s accuracy and quality. We have utilized a variety of machine learning algorithms such as random forest, logistic regression, support vector machines, and deep learning neural networks. We assessed the performance of these models using the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). Our findings show that while more sophisticated algorithms—especially deep learning models—perform better at spotting possible instances of CVD, more conventional models—such as regression—offer significant predictive power. We also investigated the role that feature selection has in improving the interpretability and efficiency of the model. This study highlights the potential of machine learning to transform CVD prediction and emphasizes the importance of using many forms of data to provide a thorough risk evaluation. Our research adds to the continuing efforts in personalized medicine by providing information on creating more precise and effective predictive tools for cardiovascular health management.

Death rates can be lowered by the early detection of heart diseases and the constant monitoring of patients by physicians. Unfortunately, heart disease cannot always be detected accurately, and a doctor cannot be in touch with a patient 24/7. Machine learning (ML) has the potential to aid in diagnostics by providing a more precise basis for prediction and making decisions using data given by healthcare sectors throughout the world. This study aims to employ several feature selection methods to develop an accurate ML technique for heart disease prediction in its earliest stages. The feature selection process was performed using three distinct methods, namely, chi-square, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and mutual information (MI). The three feature groups that were ultimately selected were referred to as SF-1, SF-2, and SF-3, respectively. Then, ten different ML classifiers were used to determine the best technique, and which feature subset was the greatest fit. These classifiers included Naive Bayes, support vector machine (SVM), voting, XGBoost, AdaBoost, bagging, decision tree (DT), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), random forest (RF), and logistic regression (LR), and they were denoted as (A1, A2, …, A10). The proposed approach for predicting heart diseases was evaluated using a private dataset, a publicly available dataset, and multiple cross-validation methods. To find the classifier that generates the best rate of accurate heart disease predictions, we applied the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to fix the issue of unbalanced data. The experimental findings demonstrated that the XGBoost classifier achieved the optimal performance using the combined datasets and SF-2 feature subset with the following rates: 97.57% for accuracy, 96.61% for sensitivity, 90.48% for specificity, 95.00% for precision, 92.68% for F1 score, and 98% for AUC. The development of an explainable artificial intelligence approach that makes use of SHAP methodologies is being done to get an understanding of how the system predicts its ultimate results. The proposed technique had great promise for the healthcare sector to predict early-stage heart disease with cheap cost and minimal time. Ultimately, the best ML method has been used to make a mobile app that lets users enter HD symptoms and quickly receive a heart disease prediction.

AB  - The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into business processes has significantly enhanced decision-making capabilities across various industries such as finance, healthcare, and retail. However, explaining the decisions made by these AI systems poses a significant challenge due to the opaque nature of recent deep learning models, which typically function as black boxes. To address this opacity, a multitude of explainability techniques have emerged. However, in practical business applications, the challenge lies in selecting an appropriate explainability method that balances comprehensibility with accuracy. This paper addresses the practical need of understanding differences in the output of explainability techniques by proposing a novel method for the assessment of the agreement of different explainability techniques. Based on our proposed methods, we provide a comprehensive comparative analysis of six leading explainability techniques to help guiding the selection of such techniques in practice. Our proposed general-purpose method is evaluated on top of one of the most popular deep learning architectures, the Vision Transformer model, which is frequently employed in business applications. Notably, we propose a novel metric to measure the agreement of explainability techniques that can be interpreted visually. By providing a practical framework for understanding the agreement of diverse explainability techniques, our research aims to facilitate the broader integration of interpretable AI systems in business applications.

AB  - In the GDP of Bangladesh, the contribution of agriculture is significant. To the mass population, mango is the most preferred fruit because of its variety, nutritional value, and taste. However, mango production is hampered due to leaf disease often. So, automatic mango leaf disease diagnosis methods are essential, especially in the context of Bangladesh. This study aims to detect mango leaf disease by deep learning. Therefore, we proposed a customized EfficientNet model utilizing a channel attention module. In our proposed model vanilla EfficientNet is incorporated with a channel attention module to capture the essential channels of the feature maps to detect mango leaf disease. The experiment is conducted on a dataset consisting of 4000 images of 8 classes. To evaluate the performance, the research is carried out on two segments such as single train-validation-test split and 5-fold cross-validation. Also, the performance of the proposed model is compared with pretrained CNN architectures such as AlexNet and ResNet50. In the result evaluation, it found that the proposed model obtained 98.88% accuracy in a single train-validation-test split and an average 98.93% accuracy in 5-fold cross-validation. It is worth mentioning that the performance of the proposed model is not only superior to AlexNet and ResNet50 but also to methods of related study on the same dataset. Lastly, to provide a model's performance interpretation an explainable AI method (LIME) is used.

AB  - One essential and often used tool for the diagnosis of cardiovascular disorders is the electrocardiogram (ECG). With the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI), it is possible to have learning-based approaches for the automatic detection of several types of heart diseases. Despite the fact that deep learning models have shown remarkable results in automated ECG analysis, they frequently lack model interpretability, which is crucial for healthcare applications. Certain techniques made use of ECG data, which can help identify a variety of illnesses, especially arrhythmias. Precisely categorizing heartbeats is necessary for arrhythmia detection, which is an essential part of ECG analysis. The ECG signals used in this study are pre-processed for heartbeat segmentation and noise reduction. Therefore, it is evident that reliable automated detection methods are required. The proposed framework is subjected to multiple optimizations in terms of preprocessing, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning. In our study, we created a brand-new method for detecting arrhythmias in ECG signals termed FSHOADC. The experimental results show that the recommended machine learning framework and optimizations might enhance the performance of arrhythmia diagnosis and detection. It is also noted that the suggested method outperforms other works in the literature, achieving an accuracy of 98.8%.

AB  - Remote patient monitoring aspect of Healthcare 4.0 has revolutionized the way we pursue medical treatment. Integration of Medical Internet of Things (MIoT), patient centric healthcare devices and remote robotic equipment has vanished the separative line between physical onsite monitoring and remote monitoring. Secure use of available network to handle this critical patient data is one of the major concern raised due to this methodology. To mitigate this paramount concern Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can be utilized to detect in malicious activity or manipulation occurred on incoming data. Though use of ML algorithms along with conventional feature extraction technique brings performance saturation challenge and creates a black-box in this highly complex communication environment. To overcome this drawback, we propose X-NET, an eXplainable Artificial Intelligent (X-AI) based network data security approach for Healthcare 4.0 applications. For comparison purpose we have used five different types of tradition feature extraction techniques along with Naive Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR) and Perception. Utilization of X-AI algorithms such as LIME and SHAP has significantly boosted the overall performance and reliability of X-NET. Performance evolution of our proposed approach has been done through various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, Receiver Operating Characteristic and Precision-Recall Trade-off. Thus, X-NET contributes in defining secured, reliable and robust remote patient monitoring scheme for Healthcare 4.0.

AB  - This work demonstrates the effectiveness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and proposes a fresh approach to prostate cancer diagnosis through the application of machine learning models. The research makes use of a dataset of 2498 prostate pictures, of which 40% show benign diseases and 60% show cancerous ones. Many machine learning models are trained using comprehensive feature extraction, with an emphasis on texture- and intensity-based variables. With accuracy of 95.8%, precision, recall, and F1 scores of 96.2%, 95.5%, and 95.8%, respectively, CNN performs remarkably well. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) all show great accuracy with scores of 92.2%, 88.7%, and 86.5%, respectively. A thorough examination can result in more advantages and suitability of various models for prostate cancer screening. CNN is a suitable option for workflow integration in the healthcare industry because of its improved performance metrics and interpretability. With its ability to make better decisions, the accuracy of diagnoses and patient outcomes are improved and also these machine learning models have the potential to fundamentally alter the way prostate cancer is treated. This research shows how computational techniques could revolutionize the way prostate cancer is now identified and open up the opportunity to more accurate and individualized treatment plans.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease remains the world’s leading cause of mortality, with its often asymptomatic nature in the early stages leading to potentially fatal outcomes if undiagnosed and untreated. Advanced diagnostic tools are essential for effective early prediction and management, which not only saves lives but also alleviates the economic burden on healthcare systems. This study aims to employ and enhance the C4.5 Decision Tree algorithm for the classification of heart disease, utilizing key attributes such as blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose levels, smoking and alcohol consumption, activity levels, and overall cardiovascular health. The methodology involves calculating entropy and gain values to iteratively construct a decision tree, employing pruning techniques to enhance efficiency and clarity. The constructed model demonstrates seven key rules: four predicting the presence of cardiovascular disease and three indicating its absence. Our results show that the enhanced C4.5 algorithm achieves a classification accuracy of 73.25%, surpassing other models like kNN and Naïve Bayes. This research underscores the robustness and reliability of the enhanced C4.5 algorithm in clinical settings, highlighting its potential to facilitate timely interventions for heart-related ailments. Our findings contribute to the development of more effective diagnostic tools for cardiovascular disease, offering a promising approach to early detection and improved patient outcomes.

AB  - This study addresses the challenge of constructing interpretable machine-learning models for complex decision-making processes. Using techniques like Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive explanations, as well as new algorithmic approaches that attempt to keep a balance, between model complexity versus interpretability. A transparency-enhancing technique, grounded in Information Bottleneck theory, improves interpretability without penalizing predictive performance.The article also introduces a live anti-discrimination approach through which disparate impact and equal opportunity gaps can be resolved in AI-based decision-making. These models have been practically shown in the deployment of an Interactive Decision Support System (IDSS) operating at 95% correct diagnosis and very high acceptance by users when tested with patients from healthcare settings.Uncovering such results, for interpretable models in high-stakes domains, not only shows promise of interpretability but provides a starting point that could guide future work to improve transparency and fairness odds across AI. The research has far-reaching implications for ethical AI deployment, serving as a strong basis for the future growth of responsible AI systems within all industries..

AB  - Survival analysis plays a pivotal role in healthcare, particularly in analyzing time-to-event data such as in disease progression, treatment efficacy, and drug development. Traditional methods in survival analysis often face a trade-off: they either make linear assumptions, which are interpretable but may be overly simplistic, or they capture complex, non-linear relationships but lack clarity and ease of understanding. To overcome these challenges, we develop a novel machine-learning approach. This method is an extension of the Cox proportional hazards model. Unlike its traditional version, our method can model non-linear relationships between various features and the associated risks without relying on specific distribution assumptions. More importantly, it also adds the ability to learn rules from the dataset that are comprehensible to humans. Our proposed model demonstrated comparable performance in our experimental evaluations relative to other existing survival analysis models while also successfully identifying potential high-risk factors and clinical rules, demonstrating its practical utility in real-world healthcare settings. This balance of sophisticated analysis and interpretability makes it promising in the field of survival analysis.

AB  - The lack of standardization and transparency of ESG (environment, society and governance) data limits the effectiveness of traditional quantitative analysis. In this paper, a quantitative analysis model of ESG indicators based on multi-source data fusion and machine learning algorithm is designed. The model integrates multi-dimensional indicator data of environment, society and governance. Through data cleaning, standardization and normalization, random forest (RF) is used as the main algorithm to predict ESG comprehensive score, and the Stacking integration method combined with support vector machine (SVM) and logistic regression (LR) is tried to further improve the prediction accuracy. The empirical analysis selects 500 large listed companies in the world as the research object, covering many industries. The results show that the integrated model has obvious advantages in forecasting the comprehensive score of ESG, the mean square error (MSE) is significantly reduced, and the determination coefficient is significantly improved, indicating that the model can more accurately reflect the actual changes of ESG score. In addition, by analyzing the model performance of different industries, it is found that the prediction error of science and technology and health care industries is small, while the prediction error of energy and manufacturing industries is relatively high. The research in this paper not only provides new ideas and methods for the quantitative analysis of ESG indicators, but also verifies the potential of machine learning algorithm in improving ESG evaluation accuracy and prediction ability through empirical analysis.

AB  - Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is challenging to diagnose due to its subtle and transient symptoms, making noninvasive diagnostic tools crucial for early detection. This study explores the use of a custom ResNet deep learning model combined with the Grad-CAM interpretability technique for mTBI detection via speech analysis. Speech data were transformed into Mel-spectrograms and fed into the model for binary classification between concussed and control individuals. The Grad-CAM method provided insights into which frequency regions of the Mel-spectrogram were most important for the model's predictions, with higher-frequency regions identified as significant for the model in detecting mTBI. Using Monte Carlo Cross-Validation (MCCV), we evaluated 50 different subject train-test split configurations to gain insights into the model's performance stability and variability. This analysis can assess the model's ability to learn consistent patterns within the dataset and suggest potential generalization tendencies. The variability observed in the performance metrics distribution underscores the importance of robust evaluation methods, particularly when working with small datasets. The combination of deep learning, robust evaluation technique and interpretability in this study contributes to the development of clinically viable, speech-based tools for mTBI detection, with potential applications in sports and healthcare settings.

AB  - Deployments of artificial intelligence in medical diagnostics mandate not just accuracy and efficacy but also trust, emphasizing the need for explainability in machine decisions. The recent trend in automated medical image diagnostics leans towards the deployment of Transformer-based architectures, credited to their impressive capabilities. Since the self-attention feature of transformers contributes towards identifying crucial regions during the classification process, they enhance the trustability of the methods. However, the complex intricacies of these attention mechanisms may fall short of effectively pinpointing the regions of interest directly influencing AI decisions. Our research endeavors to innovate a unique attention block that underscores the correlation between ’regions’ rather than ’pixels’. To address this challenge, we introduce an innovative system grounded in prototype learning, featuring an advanced self-attention mechanism that goes beyond conventional ad-hoc visual explanation techniques by offering comprehensible visual insights. A combined quantitative and qualitative methodological approach was used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on the large-scale NIH chest X-ray dataset. Experimental results showed that our proposed method offers a promising direction for explain-ability, which can lead to the development of more trustable systems, which can facilitate easier and rapid adoption of such technology into routine clinics.

AB  - Brain tumors often feature the genetic biomarker O6-Methylguanine-DNA-Methyltransferase (MGMT) associated with a favorable response to chemotherapy and an improved prognosis. Currently, detecting MGMT presence relies on invasive brain biopsy procedures. Thus, this study aims to develop a data mining-based radiomics methodology for non-invasive identifying and evaluating brain tumor genetic biomarkers using radiomics in magnetic resonance images (MRIs). MRIs with segmentation masks were used to extract variables and employ feature selection techniques. Several machine learning models were trained, where Logistic Regression, employing LASSO selection, emerged as the best-performing model, achieving 61% accuracy. Additionally, an explainability module utilizing Shap values identified three significant variables: a T1CE sequence variable related to texture, a FLAIR sequence variable of first-order statistics, and a T1 sequence variable of first-order statistics. This radiomic methodology, with its performance and explainable nature, could offer diagnostic support to clinicians in tumor management.

AB  - Schizophrenia is an example of a rare mental disorder that is challenging to diagnose using conventional methods. Deep learning methods have been extensively employed to aid in the diagnosis of schizophrenia. However, their efficacy relies heavily on data quantity, and their black-box nature raises trust concerns, especially in medical diagnosis contexts. In this study, we leverage a deep learning-based method for the automatic diagnosis of schizophrenia using EEG brain recordings. This approach utilizes generative data augmentation, a powerful technique that enhances the accuracy of the diagnosis. Additionally, our study provides a framework to use when dealing with the challenge of limited training data for the diagnosis of other potential rare mental disorders. To enable the utilization of time-frequency features, spectrograms were extracted from the raw signals. After exploring several neural network architectural setups, a proper convolutional neural network (CNN) was used for the initial diagnosis. Subsequently, using Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) and Variational Autoencoder (VAE), two different synthetic datasets were generated in order to augment the initial dataset and address the over-fitting issue. The augmented dataset using VAE achieved a 3.0% improvement in accuracy, reaching 99.0%, and also demonstrated faster convergence. Finally, we addressed the lack of trust in black-box models using the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) algorithm to determine the most important superpixels (frequencies) in the diagnosis process.

AB  - Within the healthcare sector, deploying Machine Learning (ML) models involves trial-and-error approaches, considerable time to create task-specific models, and collaboration between ML experts and physicians. To overcome these hurdles, Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) appears as a promising resource towards the advancement of precision and personalised medicine. Despite being a hot topic, AutoML remains relatively underexplored in the realm of medical imaging. To address this gap, the research objectives are to enrich the body of knowledge by comprehensively exploring the AutoML solutions, evaluating and comparing their performance, and even verifying their compliance to Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) principles. Furthermore, we provide a unified solution with open-source AutoML solutions, as they seek to democratize access for less experienced users. Thus, this research paper contains a methodology to identify and evaluate 5 solutions, Fastai, Ktrain, Ludwig, Autogluon, and Autokeras, across 3 relevant medical imaging datasets. Their evaluation involved binary classifications using chest X-rays and breast histopathological images, and a multi-class scenario with brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images. Results reveal that both Ktrain and Fastai consistently demonstrate lower F1-Score values, regardless of the dataset. This stems from their limited level of automation, as the user is required to introduce the type of architecture and fine-tune certain hyperparameters. In contrast, Ludwig when employing the EfficientNet architecture, it roughly takes 10 minutes to achieve an F1-Score of  $98.06{\pm }0.86$ % with the chest X-ray dataset. About 17 minutes to acquire  $98.16{\pm }0.50$ % with the histopathological dataset, and nearly 7 minutes to reach an F1-Score of  $96.52{\pm }1.07$ % with the brain MRI dataset. In this dataset is where Autokeras and Autogluon failed to provide suitable metrics for a typical multi-class problem. Nonetheless, in both binary scenarios, they achieve state-of-art results. Although having a higher execution time than Ludwig, they have a more robust search space. Finally, our findings highlight the need to incorporate XAI principles to improve the user’s experience, particularly for non-ML practitioners.

Our approach introduces two key innovations: 1) integrating data-driven statistical relevance weights into the fusion strategy to effectively utilize complementary information from heterogeneous modalities, and 2) incorporating human-centric movement characteristics into multimodal representation learning for detailed modeling of pain behaviors. Validated across various deep learning architectures, our method demonstrates superior performance and broad applicability. We propose a customizable framework that aligns each modality with a suitable classifier based on statistical significance, advancing personalized and effective multimodal fusion. Furthermore, our methodology provides explainable analysis of multimodal data, contributing to interpretable and explainable AI in healthcare. By highlighting the importance of data diversity and modality-specific representations, we enhance traditional fusion techniques and set new standards for recognizing complex pain behaviors. Our findings have significant implications for promoting patient-centered healthcare interventions and supporting explainable clinical decision-making.

AB  - Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) provides a secure, collaborative machine learning framework that allows multiple institutions, each holding different subsets of features, to jointly train models without sharing sensitive data. Despite its advantages, VFL requires a careful balance between multiple factors, such as explainability, privacy, and data security. Enhancing model interpretability often necessitates revealing more about the underlying data, which can compromise privacy. Conversely, strong privacy safeguards may obscure the model’s decision-making process, hindering explainability. In this paper, we explore this critical explainability-privacy trade-off and propose a novel framework designed to navigate this balance while ensuring robust utility and accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework using a real-world healthcare dataset, focusing on scenarios where both interpretability and privacy are paramount. The numerical experiments showcase how our approach maintains model accuracy while providing interpretable insights into predictions, all while preserving privacy at critical junctures. This work underscores the importance of addressing the explainability-privacy dichotomy in federated learning systems, offering a path toward building transparent, trustworthy AI models in sensitive domains such as healthcare.

AB  - Globally, an estimated 80 million people have glaucoma, a major cause of blindness, with half remaining undiagnosed and at risk of vision loss. This paper addresses this challenge by exploring deep learning architectures and feature engineering in machine learning for early glaucoma detection using retinal images. This review is about the pros and cons of each of the strategies. Deep learning is capable of extracting features from the data without any pre-defined understanding of the data while feature engineering provides fully crafted features based on prior knowledge about the data. We then examine their ability to accurately detect glaucoma and to do so efficiently and with easily-interpretable results. This review seeks to benefit healthcare professionals and researchers practice and explore the potential of the described techniques in the creation of automated glaucoma detection systems, thus enhancing early diagnosis and better patient care.
