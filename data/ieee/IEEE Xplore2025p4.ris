AB  - A critical disease, a brain tumor must be categorized correctly if treatment and patient management are to be directed. Due to interpretational bias by individuals and errors that are rife in human practice, traditional diagnostic methods sometimes prove wanting. To increase the accuracy of differentiating brain tumors from similar tissues in MR images, this work explores modern computational approaches-particularly CNNs and RFs. This is evidenced by reviewing related literature on MRI-based brain tumor detection, for which deep learning methods are deemed efficient but challenging. The proposed strategy entails preprocessing of the MRI then using CNNs in feature extraction and enhancing performance by the Random Forest classifier. Further, the work uses Explainable Artificial Intelligence (X-AI) approaches, specifically Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), to address the interpretability challenge common in healthcare. Meningiomas yield a 98.5% accuracy, and the other performance parameters calculated that depict a high degree of precision and recall with many tumor types suggest a reasonable classification. This twin objective of maintaining accuracy and interpretability not only enhances the decision-making process of clinicians but also assures trust in deploying AI solutions for producing better patient outcomes in the case of brain tumors.

AB  - The exponential growth of blockchain and machine learning (ML) technologies has catalyzed innovations across domains; however, the lack of comprehensive reviews addressing their integration limits our understanding of their synergistic potential. Existing reviews focus on specific applications and neglect scalability, security, and performance metrics that are critical for deploying ML-blockchain frameworks in complex environments. To bridge these gaps, this study conducts a comprehensive review of the most recent state-of-the-art research that evaluates methodologies, performance metrics, and their applicability. The reviewed methods include random forests, federated learning (FL), explainable AI (XAI), reinforcement learning (RL), and federated/hybrid models such as federated reinforcement learning and learning chains. These methods have emerged with the potential to support the balance among accuracy, privacy, and scalability across a variety of domains, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), healthcare, smart grids, and decentralized finance scenarios. This review identifies optimal methods for blockchain optimization and scalability enhancement, while providing a roadmap for integrating advanced ML techniques with blockchains. The findings will assist in significantly advancing domain knowledge in blockchain and guide future research and real-world implementation operations.

AB  - Accurate and interpretable water quality prediction is crucial for environmental monitoring and public health. This study evaluates six machine learning models—Random Forest, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Support Vector Regression (SVR)—using real-world groundwater data from ARPAE. Model performance was assessed via Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE), while SHAP values were employed for feature-level interpretability. Results indicate that Random Forest outperforms all models in both accuracy and explainability, whereas SVR demonstrates poor predictive capability and lacks meaningful interpretability. The study highlights the trade-offs between predictive power and transparency, offering insights for selecting appropriate models in water quality monitoring systems.

AB  - Diagnosis of brain tumors remains a significant problem in the field of neuro-oncology, especially when there are limited resources since the automated MRI analysis requires considerable time and is mostly performed manually. This study describes a more sophisticated approach to transfer learning that combines fine-tuning strategies and modern interpretability techniques to enhance the efficiency and clinical reliability of deep learning models. We assess the VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3 convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using an unprecedented dataset of 24,599 MRI scans, which exceeds previous efforts in scope and variety. The technology improves model and interpretability through adaptive learning rate scheduling, layer-wise fine-tuning, and gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM). The experiments show great performance on benchmark datasets with an accuracy of 99.5%, while Grad-CAM images allow interpretable tumor localization and ensure essential understanding. This study addresses dataset limitations, enhance explainability for a more comprehensive scalable solution for early detection of brain tumors, increasing the role of AI in neuroimaging and improving healthcare delivery with low resources in radiology.

AB  - The complexity and dynamism of real-world systems are constantly increasing, necessitating the development of adaptive predictive models capable of handling non-linearity, uncertainty, and changing surroundings. This research delves into the potential of building adaptive models that enhance prediction accuracy in various dynamical applications by utilizing AI and ML techniques. We offer a platform for realtime data analysis and model adaptation using advanced algorithms including Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and ensemble learning methods. In this study, we test these models in many real-world settings, such as autonomous systems, healthcare diagnostics, financial projections, and climate prediction. These are all domains where standard approaches often fall short when it comes to making broad generalizations. Our results show that AI-based models, especially deep neural networks (DNNs) and ensemble techniques, outperform traditional methods in acquiring hierarchical patterns, managing high-dimensional data, and adapting to real-time data fluctuation. Metrics like accuracy, precision, and error reduction, among others, are significantly improved by models that use adaptive learning methods, according to a comparative study. In addition, the study elucidates the role that computing efficiency, scalability, and model interpretability have in guaranteeing the successful implementation. Improving predictive modeling's resilience and dependability is the goal of this work, which tackles issues including data drift, non-stationary situations, and noise. The implementation of adaptive algorithms allows for this to be achieved. The results show how potential AI and ML are for revolutionary change in predictive applications. The results provide light on how to optimize hyperparameters, choose models, and learn in real-time for datasets that are constantly changing. Integrating hybrid AI methods with reinforcement learning will be the focus of future research aimed at enhancing decision-making and flexibility even further. Improved, more efficient, and more flexible solutions for real-world problems are on the horizon because to this research's advancements in intelligent predictive systems.

AB  - Timeliness of therapy and better patient outcomes depend on the identification of brain tumours. Conventional techniques depend on knowledgeable MRI scan analysis, which may be time-consuming. In order to improve both accuracy and interpretability in brain tumour diagnosis, this work presents an advanced classification model combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Explainable AI (X-AI), more especially Grad-CAM. Using MRI images, the model sorts three common tumour types: pituitary tumours, meningioma, and glioma. With data preparation including picture scaling and normalising, the approach trains a CNN model on a collection of 3000 MRI images. Six convolutional layers then collect important characteristics from the CNN architecture, then max-pooling helps to lower dimensionality. Post-classification Grad-CAM is used to provide visual explanations emphasising important MRI scan regions that helped with decision-making, therefore encouraging interpretability and confidence among medical professionals. Along with great precision (93.5%), recall (94.6%), and F1-score (94.03%), the model obtained an amazing 94.47% accuracy. These findings exceeded more recent state-of- the-art models such DenseNet121 and ResNet50. In clinical environments, transparency is very vital, so the CNN-Grad-CAM hybrid technique guarantees both performance in classification and transparency. This environmentally friendly method of health education offers radiologists quick and accurate tumour detection, therefore guiding their choices and maybe lowering diagnostic times. This approach provides a major addition to healthcare and education in diagnosis technologies by integrating explainability with deep learning.

AB  - Machine Learning Health Operations (MLHOps) is the combination of processes for reliable, efficient, usable, and ethical deployment and maintenance of machine learning models in healthcare settings. This paper provides both a survey of work in this area and guidelines for developers and clinicians to deploy and maintain their own models in clinical practice. We cover the foundational concepts of general machine learning operations and describe the initial setup of MLHOps pipelines (including data sources, preparation, engineering, and tools). We then describe long-term monitoring and updating (including data distribution shifts and model updating) and ethical considerations (including bias, fairness, interpretability, and privacy). This work therefore provides guidance across the full pipeline of MLHOps from conception to initial and ongoing deployment. We also include a checklist to ensure thorough verification of each step in the process.

AB  - The support of artificial intelligence (AI) based decision-making is a key element in future 6G networks. Moreover, AI is widely employed in critical applications such as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis. In such applications, using AI as black-box models is risky and challenging. Hence, it is crucial to understand and trust the decisions taken by these models. Tackling this issue can be achieved by developing explainable AI (XAI) schemes that aim to explain the logic behind the black-box model behavior, and thus, ensure its efficient and safe deployment. Highlighting the relevant inputs the black-box model uses to accomplish the desired prediction is essential towards ensuring its interpretability. Recently, we proposed a novel perturbation-based feature selection framework called XAI-CHEST and oriented toward channel estimation in wireless communications. This manuscript provides the detailed theoretical foundations of the XAI-CHEST framework. In particular, we derive the analytical expressions of the XAI-CHEST loss functions and the noise threshold fine-tuning optimization problem. Hence the designed XAI-CHEST delivers a smart low-complex one-shot input feature selection methodology for high-dimensional model input that can further improve the overall performance while optimizing the architecture of the employed model. Simulation results show that the XAI-CHEST framework outperforms the classical feature selection XAI schemes such as local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) and shapley additive explanations (SHAP), mainly in terms of interpretability resolution as well as providing better performance-complexity trade-off.

AB  - Protein classification is a fundamental task in computational biology, aiding in function prediction and disease analysis. This study uniquely investigates the complementary role of secondary structure information alongside primary sequences in protein categorization through machine learning and deep learning techniques. A comprehensive dataset of 203,591 protein samples from the top 20 protein classes was processed using TF-IDF and embedding-based feature extraction. Seven classifiers, including Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, Neural Networks, LSTM, Bi-LSTM, and GRU, were evaluated using hold-out cross-validation. Results indicate that primary sequence-based classification achieved the highest accuracy (92%) using Random Forest with TF-IDF, while secondary structure-based classification was comparatively less effective (86%). Combining primary and secondary sequences yielded marginal improvements, suggesting that while secondary structure contributes to feature distribution and biological interpretability, it does not significantly enhance classification accuracy. Notably, oxidoreductase, ribosome, and virus proteins exhibited consistently high classification performance across all models, with 99% accuracy in both primary and combined sequence classification. SHAP analysis highlighted that secondary structure features (‘Secondary_hh’ and ‘Secondary_hhh’) contributed to virus protein classification, emphasizing their potential for structural interpretation.

The model involves several stages: data preprocessing to normalize gene expression data, graph construction to represent gene interactions, GCN implementation to extract relational features, contrastive learning to improve feature separability, and the incorporation of angular distance metrics to enhance sensitivity to subtle variations. The combined loss function, integrating cross-entropy and contrastive losses, ensures robust optimization during training. When compared to traditional machine learning methods such as Random Forest, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, and Artificial Neural Networks, the proposed model demonstrated superior 71.22% accuracy, 65.13% precision, and 64.7% recall. Despite these promising results, the study is limited by the relatively small dataset size, which may restrict the model’s ability to generalize across broader patient populations and complex clinical scenarios. Future studies should incorporate larger and more diverse datasets to better capture the heterogeneity of HIV patients and further validate the proposed framework. While computationally intensive, the framework shows promise in advancing HIV patient profiling and guiding personalized treatment strategies, with future work focusing on improving efficiency and interpretability for broader clinical applications.

AB  - Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most difficult and lethal types of cancer due to its mild early symptoms and late-stage detection, which frequently limits treatment options and lowers survival rates. The development of deep learning and artificial intelligence in recent years has transformed tumor detection and medical imaging, opening up new avenues for quicker and more precise diagnosis.This study introduces a clever, intuitive, computer-aided diagnosis approach that uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect pancreatic cancer early. To identify if an image is malignant or not, the model is trained on CT and MRI scans, utilizing the capability of the VGG16 deep learning architecture.The Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) feature of the system, which uses aesthetically pleasing heatmaps to emphasize the tumor-affected areas of the scan, significantly improves interpretability and confidence in AI-driven conclusions. The approach is implemented using a simple Flask web application that enables users or medical professionals to upload scan photos, view the heatmap overlays, receive categorization findings, and get health precautions. With the help of state-of-the-art deep learning methods and a real-time interactive platform, this initiative seeks to assist radiologists and other healthcare professionals in reaching quicker and better diagnoses. Ultimately, this approach offers a promising first step toward incorporating artificial intelligence into standard medical processes by enhancing clinical outcomes and promoting early cancer diagnosis.

AB  - Deep learning is now a game-changing technology with applications in medical imaging and is especially showing great promise in the diagnosis of malignancies. In summary, bone cancer is a rare but challenging disease that requires accurate diagnosis for prompt treatment. Biopsy is time-consuming and subjective, being heavily dependent on radiological examination. The first is applying explainable AI techniques to improve the interpretability and performance of trained bone cancer detection models for clinical practice; the second is using CNNs to increase the efficiency and accuracy of bone cancer detection and develop a highly accurate and reliable LSTM model for automatic detection of bone cancer from time-sequence images. In the scenario of CNN architectures, improvements are made by employing cutting-edge methodologies like transfer learning, data augmentation, or optimization methodologies that guarantee better feature extraction and classification. To more efficiently utilize sequential information from medical images, hybrid CNN-LSTM architectures are also proposed to learn not only intra-frame features (of a single image) from CNN but also related sequential contexts across timeframes using LSTM in the movie time series data of bone tumors. Additionally, breeds of explainable AI methods like Grad-CAM, SHAP, LIME are used to disclose model predictions and build trust, and encourage adoption by clinicians.

AB  - AI technology revolutionizes the treatment of lung cancer and other related lung cancer diagnoses, hence becoming the game-changing technology in the diagnosis and treatment of this serious disease. As one of the most prevalent and deadliest cancers globally, early identification, precise diagnosis, and efficient planning for the treatment of lung cancer have always been difficult. The therapy using AI-based methods is introducing another novel way of addressing the problems concerning lung cancer via advanced imaging analysis, predictive modeling, and tailored plans of treatment, the most important among which is of course, imaging analysis. What is certainly most exciting among the applications of AI in lung cancer treatment is in the realm of imaging analysis. AI has been seen to be extremely clever in the interpretation of images rather than using machine learning or deep learning but has been much faster and more accurate than a human being while doing it. Besides, these systems also increase the general accurateness of diagnosis through a reduction of the error in diagnosis and consistent results. Alluring promises are made for AI soon for the treatment of lung cancer. In this paper, we discuss how AI has been transformed into imaging, diagnosis, and treatment planning and how this will improve patient outcomes and completely transform the way healthcare is delivered. We also consider barriers still to be cleared for realizing fully the potential benefits of AI. These include problems such as the quality of available data used in model interpretation and generalizability across different healthcare settings. Therefore, we end and suggest some future research on collaboration by emphasizing the safe, effective, and ethical entry of AI into normal clinical practice.

AB  - Pregnancy is a critical period during which vigilant monitoring of fetal and maternal health is essential to prevent complications and ensure positive outcomes. Traditional fetal health assessment methods such as cardiotocography (CTG), ultrasound imaging, and clinical evaluation, though effective, often suffer from interpretability issues, episodic monitoring, and dependency on expert judgment. This study proposes an advanced machine learning-based framework to classify fetal health status into normal and abnormal categories using CTG data, aiming to enhance diagnostic accuracy and clinical reliability. A comparative analysis was conducted using ensemble-based models—XGBoost and LightGBM—as well as support vector machines (SVM). Among these, XGBoost achieved the highest performance with 94.2% accuracy, 0.93 precision, and 0.94 recall. LightGBM followed closely, offering comparable results with faster computation. Furthermore, the study integrates explainable AI techniques to improve model transparency and facilitate trust among healthcare practitioners. The results demonstrate the potential of interpretable machine learning models to support obstetric decision-making, especially in settings lacking specialized medical expertise. This approach not only enhances fetal health classification but also lays the foundation for intelligent, data-driven prenatal care systems.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) have evolved as a critical public health challenge driving high mortality rates and causing fatal physical damages. The CVDs have immense adverse impacts on public health as well as on the economy. Therefore, addressing and mitigating the influences caused by CVDs requires careful attention in the effective detection of CVDs. Thankfully, Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML) approaches exhibit significant progress in detecting CVDs. In this paper, DL and ML approaches are implemented to detect the risk of 3 CVDs including Stroke, Congestive Heart Failure (CHF), and Hypertension, from retinal fundus images (RFIs). DL approaches, specifically, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based Transfer Learning (TL) models including VGG16, VGG19, Xception, DenseNet121, DenseNet169, and DenseNet201 are considered feature extractors (FEs). A custom DL-based model has been utilized as a classifier. Additionally, a set of ML classifiers such as Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) has been employed. Moreover, an Ensemble Learning (EL) approach has been implemented. RFIs have been accumulated from 8 datasets. The EL approach emerged as the best performer in detecting both the risk of Stroke and CHF (accuracy: 94.97%, recall: 94.69%, precision: 95.64%, f1-score: 95.19%, and AUC: 99.08%) as well as Hypertension (accuracy: 96.02%, recall: 93.73%, precision: 93.78%, f1-score: 93.76%, and AUC: 98.09%). The Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) has been implemented as an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) technique to yield feature visualization. This endeavor can be considered an outstanding contribution to the fruitful detection of CVDs.

AB  - As the most common cause of dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is vividly visible in the daily lives of those who have it, with the iconic symptoms of progressive cognitive and behavioral decline. Since no definitive cure exists, early diagnosis is crucial for effective disease management. This study explores the classification of AD using gradient boosting algorithms, namely XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, utilizing sparse clinical and demographic data, including MiniMental State Examination (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), and other cognitive and structural brain-related features. To enhance interpretability, Explainable AI (XAI) via SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is applied to assess the significance of each feature. Experimental results demonstrate the significant role of the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) feature in diagnosis. Comparative analysis reveals that XGBoost achieved the highest AUC (0.9135) when all features were included. However, LightGBM outperformed the other boosting algorithms without CDR data, achieving an AUC of 0.8982.

AB  - The explosive growth of blockchain technology mechanisms has spurred the evolution of a variety of decentralized designs that offer increased transparency, security, and trust. Nonetheless, there are still great challenges on the road of the blockchain in particular the public blockchain, mainly the inefficiency of the consensus mechanism (e.g. Proof of Work, Proof of Stake) and the issue of scalability. Although safe, these mechanisms require lengthy transaction processing times and are energy-intensive so that current blockchain solutions can only be used for small scale and not real time applications. This study investigates the utilization of Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically, machine learning (ML) algorithms, to enhance and streamline blockchain consensus protocols. For example, the study explores the types of decentralized networks that can be accelerated with less energy consumption and lower transaction latency using AI methods including reinforcement learning, supervised learning, and deep learning. The paper also provides a comprehensive overview of recently proposed AI (ML in particular) solutions for optimizing some fundamental components of consensus protocols. For instance, ML models may be used to preemptively predict and adjust network circumstances, dynamically tune consensus parameters, and maximize block generation rates to reduce overall latency. Moreover, the research delves into the potential of AI to address problems such as network congestion, transaction bottlenecks, and the centralization of power in PoW systems.

AB  - Liver disease poses a significant health burden worldwide, necessitating accurate prediction methods for early diagnosis and intervention. In this study, we employed models including Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), Logistic Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Bayes Classifier, augmented by Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), to predict the presence of liver disease in individuals. SVM served as the primary predictive model, while XAI technique Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) provided insights into the model’s decision-making process, enhancing interpretability and trustworthiness. Through this approach, we aimed to improve diagnostic accuracy and facilitate informed clinical decision-making. An Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) has been conducted using Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) to find out the best model considering different performance measures as criteria. Our findings emphasize the utility of integrating traditional AI methods with XAI technique LIME for enhancing predictive modeling in healthcare settings.

AB  - Stroke prediction is a challenging problem in the healthcare domain, especially due to high class imbalance in datasets where data about stroke cases is a very small portion. In this study we develop a machine learning based framework for stroke prediction that tackles through powerful data preprocessing methods, such as Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) for balancing the classes. (Situated within the entire framework of a comparative evaluation of the Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and TabNet machine learning classifiers as per unique designs. In conclusion, the Random Forest classifier proved to be the best performing model with an accuracy of 99.38%, followed closely by LightGBM and CatBoost. A detailed analysis including KP song metrics including precision, F1 score, and confusion matrices were carried out to ensure thorough evaluation. The study also emphasizes the importance of explainable AI tools which improve the explainability of predictions. This framework shows that machine learning has the potential to assist with early detection of stroke and may ultimately be integrated into clinical decision-making systems.

AB  - Emergency departments (EDs) require effective approaches for quickly identifying patients at risk of critical outcomes (inpatient mortality or ICU admission within 12 hours). This study developed interpretable machine learning models using Gradient Boosting (GB) and Logistic Regression (LR) with 13 initial triage variables from the MIMIC-IV-ED database. GB performed slightly better than LR (Accuracy: 78.21% vs. 77.27%, AUROC: 0.887 vs. 0.863, AUPRC: 0.445 vs. 0.370). The Te2Rules method was used to extract 43 clinically interpretable rules from the GB model, with a overall fidelity of 98.90%. The use of the Rule Coverage Index (RCI) to categorize rules into high, medium, and low levels futher enhanced clinical utility. This study aims to strike a balance between predictive accuracy and interpretability, facilitating clinicians in early detection of critically ill presenting to the ED.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia are among the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases worldwide. With the absence of definitive treatments, early detection and precise diagnosis remain crucial for alleviating patient suffering and reducing healthcare costs. This study aimed to differentiate Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia and normal cognition using electroencephalography biomarkers. Significant power spectral density and functional connectivity features were identified via one-way analysis of variance and Scheffe's post-hoc test. A three-class classification was performed by a support vector machine classifier and explainable artificial intelligence technique was employed to investigate feature importance. This classifier achieved an average accuracy of 84.09%, and linear shapley additive explanation model identified T5-Fpl connectivity in alpha band as the most important feature, consistent with findings from previous studies. Further clinical research and brain network analysis using advanced deep learning models could enhance our understanding of the cognitive functions and neural mechanisms underlying these dementias.

AB  - Parkinson’s disease (PD) diagnosis remains challenging due to the variability in motor and non-motor symptoms. While deep learning (DL) models show promise in improving diagnostic accuracy, their "black box" nature limits clinical adoption. This study proposes an explainable AI (XAI) framework combining DL models with interpretability techniques, such as SHAP and LIME, to enhance transparency and trust. Using multimodal datasets, including clinical, imaging, and wearable sensor data, the framework identifies key features driving predictions, enabling clinicians to make informed decisions. The proposed method achieves superior performance, with an accuracy of 92%, precision of 91.1%, and recall of 90.4%, outperforming existing methods. By bridging the gap between AI outputs and clinical needs, this framework offers a practical tool for early PD diagnosis and progression monitoring.

AB  - Air pollution stands as a major public health concern of the present day because it causes both immediate and long-term health problems. Higher concentrations of harmful atmospheric pollutants, including PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, and O3 have come from the mix of fast urban development with industrial expansion and rising vehicle emissions. Along with cognitive impairment and increased death rates, the airborne pollutants produce many negative health effects, including respiratory diseases and cardiovascular problems. Using cutting-edge computational approaches by researchers has helped to improve the evaluation and mitigation of health hazards. Predicting air pollution patterns together with their health consequences has shown success using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques. The present predictive modelling methods applied in this field are investigated in the review article to understand their advantages and disadvantages. While stressing the need for transparent and scalable analytical frameworks delivering real-time results to support effective public health and environmental policies, the study emphasises the need to combine several data sources from environmental monitoring to clinical health records.

AB  - By using Multimodal Deep Learning, various data sets can be used to improve accuracy and reliability in medical diagnosis. In this context, we present MedFusionNet, a new deep learning architecture designed to integrate imaging data such as MRIs and CT scans with electronic health records for optimized EHR-driven clinical decision support systems. The primary objective of MedFusionNet is to address the limitations imposed by single-modality models using a primary hybrid fusion approach which employs CNNs, RNNs, and transformers to perform feature complementarity extraction and alignment from various data sources. Evaluation experiments indicated that MedFusionNet has achieved better results compared to preceding models with respect to staging Alzheimer’s disease, detecting pulmonary embolisms and other hallmark tasks. The diagnosis of these conditions was accomplished with high rates of accuracy, robust tolerance for missing data, and low tendency towards overfitting. Attention must be given to the innovative dynamic real-time diagnosis and treatment planning underpinned by MedFusionNet. Future work will focus on model validation and incorporating interpretability within clinical settings.

It has greatly enhanced accuracy and efficiency, especially in identifying severe diseases like cancer, heart issues, and brain abnormalities, where early detection is vital. DL also combines different forms of data, merging medical images with genetic and clinical data to present a holistic picture of a patient's health. Though it has the potential to revolutionize medical imaging, deep learning is confronted with numerous challenges such as the requirement of large labeled datasets, computational expense, privacy, and the interpretability of intricate models. Ethical and regulatory challenges make its implementation in the healthcare sector even more difficult. This paper discusses deep learning-based medical imaging, identifies current challenges, and suggests solutions like enhancing model interpretability, facilitating secure data sharing via federated learning, and encouraging collaboration between AI researchers and clinicians to tackle real-world challenges.

AB  - Effective medical treatment depends on an accurate and fast diagnosis, yet many AI-driven diagnostic models suffer from ambiguity, inadequate patient histories, and interpretability issues. Using Bayesian networks, this study introduces an Optimized Bayesian Diagnostic Assistant that enhances clinical decision-making and probabilistic reasoning. Diagnostic accuracy, sparse data performance, inference speed, and model interpretability were assessed in a comparison study versus deep learning, decision trees, rule-based systems, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and Naïve Bayes. The Bayesian model outperformed deep learning (68.3% sparse data accuracy) and other models by achieving 92.5% diagnostic accuracy, 96.4% top-3 accuracy, and 87.2% accuracy with sparse data. Despite having a little longer inference time (1.2s) than deep learning (0.8s), the Bayesian technique provided more flexibility, dynamic learning, and decision-making transparency. Its resilience in managing difficult circumstances was validated by statistical analysis, such as regression and correlation tests. These results demonstrate the superiority of Bayesian networks as an AI framework for clinical diagnosis, especially in settings with incomplete patient histories. In order to facilitate scaled AI- assisted clinical decision-making, future research will concentrate on improving computing efficiency, real-time adaptation, and seamless interaction with electronic health records (EHRs).

AB  - The detection of brain tumors in medical imaging is an important research area that calls for high levels of accuracy and fast delivery of the diagnosis. Traditional models will slowly and subsequently lose model accuracy for two possible and respective reasons, the first being a stable training dataset the model was trained upon, and the second reason involves degradation of the model as the data age. The project presented here include an adaptive brain tumor detection framework that, when it achieves a defined threshold, will retrain the model. We want to leverage machine learning and deep learning methodologies to produce a brain tumor detection framework that is hybrid to the newly trained model, therefore continuously improving model quality. Our proposal will include retaining historical datasets for initial model training, then evolving to a new incremental leaner process once new data starts to upload over time, and lastly transfer to an automated retraining process so the model can update and remain current. The expected outcomes of the research will produce a highly accurate and efficient detection system that will reduce false positive and false negative errors, potentially reducing the reliability of the diagnosis. Therefore, this research will provide a means to address healthcare practice, with an adaptive learning approach in health care that is used properly in medicine and can function successfully as a medical diagnostic approach.

AB  - At present, pneumonia is said to be one of the greatest health challenges across the world because it accounts for the deaths of millions every year, especially little children and aged people. The disease must be treated immediately, and although pneumonia is not difficult to cure, it is not properly diagnosed until its late stages. In addition, the absence of adequate diagnostic resources in developing countries and the variability in radiologist interpretations of diagnostic reports causes issues. A subfield of AI, deep learning, is very encouraging for the future of automated disease classification in medical images, most notably in chest X-rays (CXR). Such approaches, in combination with the benefits of cloud computing, may greatly enhance healthcare delivery systems by adding near-satellite coverage and reliable real-time data inputs. The content of this article is precisely targeted deep learning methodologies for the diagnosing of pneumonia on medical chest X-rays. Other effective image analysis algorithms that could assist in diagnosis are Convolutional Neural Networks, ResNet, DenseNet, and VGG Net. Due to their ability to extract complex features and provide accurate diagnosis deep learning algorithms have been helpful in analyzing medical images. Furthermore, services such as AWS, GCP, and Microsoft Azure are helpful in integrating deep learning algorithms by providing cloud computing resources like GPUs and TPUs.

AB  - Early detection and precise severity analysis of diabetic retinopathy are crucial to preventing vision loss and improving patient outcomes. To address this challenge, an advanced deep learning model for improved detection and severity analysis of diabetic retinopathy has been proposed, capable of classifying the condition into five severity levels, ensuring higher accuracy and interpretability. To start with, the EfficientNet and GoogLeNet ensemble model was built and tested that reached 95.6% accuracy, which shows the model's stability. Additional improvements were made by adopting attention layers, stacking approaches and HbA1c% levels to increase the accuracy to 98.6%, thus offering a more comprehensive insight into the progression of the disease. The use of explainable AI was performed for interpretability, along with the feature of segmentation of affected retinal regions that helps make accurate medical assessment and decision planning. A user-friendly interface is created to support real time prediction where the clinician can upload the retinal images and get the report back with prediction. This vast framework helps not only to enhance diagnostic efficacy involving diabetic retinopathy, but also equip healthcare practitioners with the crucial instruments for decision-making regarding the results, thus providing a prospect for enhanced control over the disease.

AB  - The United Nations seeks to diminish preventable deaths by 2030; yet, maternal and child mortality continue to pose significant global health issues. Attaining this objective necessitates fetal health monitoring, and cardiotocography (CTG) data, which records fetal heart rate and uterine contractions, provides a valuable, non-invasive approach to assessing fetal health. In response to the global challenge of child and maternal mortality, which saw over 295,000 maternal fatalities in 2017, this study explored the application of machine learning to enhance fetal health monitoring through Cardiotocography (CTG) data analysis. While CTG provides a non-invasive method for monitoring fetal health, traditional manual analysis is prone to subjectivity and errors, necessitating automated solutions. The research utilized a comprehensive dataset of 2,126 CTG records with 21 features, implementing various machine learning models including Stacked Model, XGBoost, Blended Model, Random Forest, KNN, SVM, and Logistic Regression after preprocessing the data through normalization and validation. The results demonstrated the superior performance of ensemble methods, with the Stacked Model achieving the highest accuracy of 96.00%, followed closely by XGBoost at 95.88%, while traditional models like KNN, SVM, and Logistic Regression showed lower performance ranging from 87.79% to 91.54%. Looking forward, the study suggests several promising directions for advancement, including the integration of deep learning architectures, development of real-time monitoring systems, enhancement of model interpretability through explainable AI, and exploration of personalized medicine applications, all aimed at ultimately reducing maternal and fetal mortality rates through more accurate and timely health assessments in clinical settings

AB  - An AI design framework was developed based on three core principles, namely understandability, trust, and usability. The framework was conceptualized by synthesizing evidence from the literature and by consulting with experts. The initial version of the AI Explainability Framework was then validated based on an in-depth expert engagement and review process. For evaluation purposes, an AI-anchored prototype, incorporating novel explainability features, was built and deployed online via Google Cloud Platform. The primary function of the prototype was to predict the postpartum depression risk using analytics models. The development of the prototype was carried out in an iterative fashion, based on a pilot-level formative evaluation, followed by a round of refinement and summative evaluation. In the formative stage, the prototype was evaluated based on an internal pilot usability test involving a small number of clinicians (n=3). The prototype was updated based on the user’s feedback in the formative stage. The System Explainability Scale (SES) metric was developed to measure the individual and interacting influence of the three dimensions of the AI Explainability Framework. For the summative stage, a comprehensive usability test was conducted involving 20 clinicians, and the SES metric was used to assess clinicians’ satisfaction with the tool. On a 5-point rating system, the tool received high scores for usability dimension, followed by trust and understandability. The average explainability score was 4.56. In terms of understandability, trust and usability, the average score was 4.51, 4.53, and 4.71 respectively. Overall, the 13-item SES metric showed strong internal consistency with Cronbach’s alpha of 0.84 and a positive correlation coefficient (Spearman's rho = 0.81, p<0.001) between the composite SES score and explainability, indicating a positive trend in AI explainability. This study demonstrated the influence of understandability, trust, and usability on AI Explainability using a combination of a novel design and experimental approach. A major finding was that the AI Explainability Framework, combined with the SES usability metric, provides a straightforward yet effective approach for developing AI-based healthcare tools that lower the challenges associated with explainability.

AB  - Predictive models for detecting mental health disorders become crucial because these disorders create global health problems that need unified intervention approaches. The increasing number of mental health conditions in workplaces has made it necessary to develop information-based detection systems that help stop the progression of these conditions. Routine clinical diagnostic practices lack both promptness and adjustable delivery of solutions thus requiring machine learning as a key component for mental health analytics. This study develops an assessment system which employs machine learning predictive models to analyze workplace mental health surveys for treatment need prediction. It uses parameters from demographics combined with behavioral elements and workplace aspects like age, gender, family history data, self-employment condition and work interference. The implemented preprocessing methods incorporated label encoding and feature scaling together with SMOTETomek in order to achieve model stability and address class imbalance issues. A comprehensive evaluation process between machine learning algorithms found their suitability for mental health treatment need prediction. The analysis included Logistic Regression as well as Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. The SHAP values feature importance assessment established work interference and family history as the essential determinants of mental health status outcomes. An ensemble Voting Classifier was implemented to combine the strongest features of the top-performing models and reached an accuracy result of 99.6%. The second best results were obtained from XGBoost and then LightGBM with 98.7% success rate and 98.2% from CatBoost. The outcomes from this study show how hybrid machine learning algorithms optimize forecasting for mental health applications through early intervention strategies.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly transforming healthcare, especially in diagnosing and managing neurological disorders such as epilepsy. Precise classification of seizures is crucial for prompt and effective intervention. This study presents a new ensemble learning framework that combines several machine learning models, such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, XGBoost, and LightGBM, along with an adaptive Quality Assurance (QA) module for finding seizures in EEG signals. Experiments on the Bonn EEG dataset reveal a notable enhancement in classification performance, with accuracy rising from 72 % to 90 % following QA inclusion. The QA module diminished high-risk seizure misclassifications by almost 95%, underscoring its capacity to enhance clinical safety. The framework incorporates ideas from recognised healthcare standards, including ISO 14971, IEC 62304, and FDA Good Machine Learning Practices (GMLP); however, complete regulatory compliance is an objective for future development. Current efforts involve improving validation among varied patient demographics, improving real-time processing functionalities, and investigating interaction with telemedicine and cloud-based healthcare infrastructures.

AB  - Digital Twins (DTs) are precise copies of actual systems that exist to which people can interact dynamically. Employed mainly in manufacturing, healthcare and smart city sectors, DTs facilitate the improvement of performance and decision-making. This integration raises the risk of cybersecurity threats including loss of data; wrong access; and advanced persistent threats. Since through integrating DT many other infrastructures are attained by the attackers it becomes a very significant agenda to counter them. In this paper, the strategy of using AI and XAI to enhance cybersecurity in DT systems is analyzed. Some of the AI techniques are Anomaly detection, analysis that predicts and Automated response facilities to provide Security precautionary measures. Such methods are improved by XAI through the addition of the process by which the decisions were made and the trust with the parties involved. Mirroring literature review, deficits of existing DT cybersecurity frameworks, analyzed, include overall issues of scalability, insufficient new threat integration, and increased opacity. For such reasons, the current paper offers a detailed cybersecurity framework that adopts both AI and XAI to fill the existing research gaps. The framework has demonstrated the application of improvements in threat detection, downloads response time and system robustness using real life cases. The presented work is intended for those states where it is possible to create safe and secure DT environments, efficient and capable of countering modern cybersecurity threats. They are aimed to cover existing voids in order to create a socially responsible approach to the use of DT in sensitive domains.

AB  - Heart disease continues to be one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Despite significant advancements in medical technology, cardiovascular diseases remain a major health concern. Early detection and accurate prediction of heart disease are essential for improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. This paper explores how machine learning (ML) models can enhance heart disease prediction and support clinical decision-making. The study provides an indepth review of current ML models, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), and deep learning techniques, such as neural networks. Heart disease is still one of the major killers in the world, and it will be important to create predictive models that can enable doctors to conduct early diagnosis and intervention. This paper explores how machine learning methods can be combined with clinical practice to enhance prediction in heart disease. We propose a detailed review of current methodologies in ML methods which have been utilized in predicting heart disease including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks. The study concentrates on the performance of the models built using clinical datasets, incorporating features of patient demographics, medical history, and laboratory results. It addresses issues of model accuracy, data quality, and the lack of interpretability inherent in models. The article establishes a comparison between the traditional clinical prediction methods and newer advanced ML models, improving predictive performance and providing avenues for clinical integration. Finally, it suggests a framework for ML based predictions in clinical workflows by exploiting the two key features: real-time risk assessment and personalization of treatment plans. Our results show that ML models, specifically ensemble and deep learning techniques, offer significant improvements over traditional approaches to heart disease prediction problems.

AB  - Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a progressive disorder that affects millions worldwide, leading to severe complications if not detected early. Traditional diagnostic methods, including blood tests and biopsies, often fail to identify CKD in its initial stages, necessitating the adoption of advanced techniques for improved accuracy. Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a powerful tool in medical imaging, significantly enhancing CKD detection using Computed Tomography (CT) scans. DL models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and hybrid architectures, have been extensively applied to extract features, classify abnormalities, and segment kidney structures. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of DL-based methodologies for CKD detection, covering pre-processing techniques, feature extraction methods, and classification approaches. A comparative evaluation of existing models is conducted, highlighting their performance, advantages, and limitations. While DL offers remarkable accuracy and automation, challenges like annotated datasets, high computational costs, and limited interpretability remain significant concerns. Emerging techniques, including transfer learning (TL), attention mechanisms, and multi-modal imaging methods, have exposed promising results in improving CKD diagnosis. The integration of Artificial intelligence (AI) in CKD detection has minimized human errors, accelerated diagnosis, and enabled real-time monitoring, contributing to personalized treatment strategies. However, clinical acceptance requires further advancements in model optimization, data availability, and explainable AI techniques to ensure reliability and transparency. This review supports as a valuable source for researchers and healthcare professionals aiming to advance CKD diagnosis through DL methodologies.

AB  - Accurate classification of otoscopic ear images is crucial for early diagnosis of ear pathologies such as Chronic Otitis Media, Earwax Plug, and Myringosclerosis. In this study, we propose a novel deep learning framework that employs a knowledge distillation strategy, wherein a high-capacity pre-trained teacher model (Vision Transformer or ResNet101) transfers learned representations to a lightweight student CNN model (EfficientNet-B0). The student network is further enhanced through the integration of an Adaptive Channel Attention (ACA) module, which selectively emphasizes informative features via channel-wise recalibration. The multi-scale feature distillation from the teacher improves generalization while the ACA block boosts sensitivity to clinically relevant regions. We validated our method on a publicly available otoscopic image dataset comprising four balanced classes. Our approach achieved an overall accuracy of 98.75%, with class-wise AUC values of 1.000 (CSOM), 1.000 (Earwax Plug), 0.994 (Myringosclerosis), and 0.992 (Normal), and a micro-average AUC of 0.997. Additionally, Grad-CAM analysis confirmed the model’s focus on diagnostically meaningful areas, supporting the interpretability of the predictions. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our distillation-based ACA-enhanced architecture in otoscopic image classification, with potential to assist clinical decision-making in primary care and telemedicine applications.

AB  - The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into medical image analysis has transformed healthcare, offering unprecedented precision in diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. However, its adoption within the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) raises significant challenges related to transparency, trustworthiness, and security. This paper introduces a novel Explainable AI (XAI) framework tailored for Medical Cyber-Physical Systems (MCPS), addressing these challenges by combining deep neural networks with symbolic knowledge reasoning to deliver clinically interpretable insights. The framework incorporates an Enhanced Dynamic Confidence-Weighted Attention (Enhanced DCWA) mechanism, which improves interpretability and robustness by dynamically refining attention maps through adaptive normalization and multi-level confidence weighting. Additionally, a Resilient Observability and Detection Engine (RODE) leverages sparse observability principles to detect and mitigate adversarial threats, ensuring reliable performance in dynamic IoMT environments. Evaluations conducted on benchmark datasets, including CheXpert, RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge, and NIH Chest X-ray Dataset, demonstrate significant advancements in classification accuracy, adversarial robustness, and explainability. The framework achieves a 15% increase in lesion classification accuracy, a 30% reduction in robustness loss, and a 20% improvement in the Explainability Index compared to state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are data structures that enable the integration of heterogeneous data sources and supporting both knowledge representation and formal reasoning. This paper introduces TrustKG, a KG-based framework designed to enhance the interpretability and reliability of hybrid AI systems in healthcare. Positioned within the context of lung cancer, TrustKG supports link prediction, which uncovers hidden relationships within medical data, and counterfactual prediction, which explores alternative scenarios to understand causal factors. These tasks are addressed through two specialized hybrid AI systems, VISE and HealthCareAI, which combine symbolic reasoning with inductive learning over KGs to provide interpretable AI solutions for clinical decision-making. Leveraging KGs to represent biomedical properties and relationships, and augmenting them with learned patterns through symbolic reasoning, our hybrid approach produces models that are both accurate and transparent. This interpretability is particularly important in medical applications, where trust and reliability in AI-driven predictions are paramount. The empirical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of VISE and HealthCareAI in improving the predictive accuracy and clarity of model outputs. By addressing challenges in link prediction—such as discovering previously unknown connections between medical entities—and in counterfactual prediction, TrustKG, with VISE and HealthCareAI, underscores the potential of integrating KGs with symbolic AI to create trustworthy, interpretable AI systems in healthcare. This paper contributes to the advancement of semantic AI, offering a pathway for robust and reliable AI solutions in clinical settings.

However, these approaches, when implemented without fairness considerations, may exacerbate existing disparities, leading to inequitable resource allocation and diagnostic inaccuracies across different demographic groups. This study introduces a novel approach via gradient projection to multi-attribute fairness optimization in healthcare AI, optimizing fairness across multiple demographic attributes and predictive performance concurrently. The approach aligns conflicting optimization objectives by projecting each gradient onto the normal plane of the other. Our method also enhances interpretability by elucidating the adjustments made during optimization, providing insights into trade-offs between fairness and accuracy.

AB  - In high-stakes decision-making, such as healthcare diagnostics, financial forecasting, and legal judgments, trust and transparency are key in AI systems. LLMs have indeed proved to be very capable in processing and generating human-like text, making them invaluable tools in these critical sectors. However, the opacity of their decision-making processes poses a significant challenge for accountability and ethical compliance. This paper introduces comprehensive Explainable AI frameworks tailored for LLMs with the goal of improving their interpretability and reliability for high-stakes environments. Using publicly available real-world datasets, we systematically study the effectiveness of various XAI techniques, including attention visualization, feature importance mapping, and counterfactual explanations. Our findings point to the fact that such embedding serves not only to demystify the decision pathways of LLMs but also to bring their operations in line with regulatory standards and stakeholder expectations. This research makes its contribution to responsible LLM deployment in situations where mistakes have significant consequences by closing the gap between sophisticated AI capabilities and the need for transparent decision-making. The proposed XAI frameworks will, in the end, be a starting point for trust, ethics, and wider acceptance of AI-driven solutions in high-stakes domains.

AB  - Globally, lung and colon cancer are two of the most prevalent and deadly diseases which require efficient and accurate detection for proper treatment in early stages. Histopatho-logical images analysis is important for the early detection and classification of numerous diseases inlcuding lung and colon cancer. But it is challenging to differentiate between tissue types based on staining, architecture and overlapping morphological features variations on histopathological slides. The proposed method provides a hybrid deep learning model with combination of MobileNetV3 and Swin Transformer-T for the classification of cancer subtypes using lung and colon cancer histopathological images dataset. The images are preprocessed with transformation methods to enhance the quality of image and fit into the model. Features are extracted from both architectures which are used for the binary and multiclassification. This methodology have shown accuracy of 99.58% for classification. To increase the interpretability and transparency of model performance, SHapley Additive exPlanations(SHAP)is integrated which highlights the regions determining model predictions. This approach can act as highly effective tool in cancer diagnosis by enhancing clinical decision-making.

AB  - This study introduces a novel approach for detecting mental workload and stress, utilizing ECG and Fingertip-PPG data from the MAUS dataset. The dataset includes physiological recordings such as ECG, Fingertip-PPG, Wrist-PPG, and GSR signals from 22 participants exposed to varying levels of mental workload and stress conditions, serving as a valuable resource for developing mental workload assessment systems. Focusing on ECG and Fingertip-PPG signals, we evaluated their effectiveness in detecting mental workload and stress. Early detection of mental workload and stress is vital for preventing adverse health outcomes, emphasizing the importance of timely intervention. In this study, by applying Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) for feature extraction and machine learning classifiers, we achieved high performance with accuracy rates of 88.64% for ECG and 80.68% for Fingertip-PPG Signal. Combining both data types (ECG and Fingertip-PPG data) further improved recall to 94.87% and boosted overall accuracy to 87.50%, marking an improvement of approximately 13%. SHAP analysis identified key features contributing to this performance, revealing key features such as the waveform length of the first Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF) for the ECG signal, the mean of the second IMF for fingertip-PPG, and the waveform length of the second IMF for combined ECG and fingertip-PPG signals. These results highlight the potential of combining physiological signals and EMD with machine learning for detecting mental workload and stress.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has become prevalent in the healthcare sector due to its ability to interpret complex medical images that may not be apparent to humans. Traditional black-box models were used to classify the disease, providing no information as to why certain things were labeled as such and not others. This paper utilizes the use of eXplainable-AI (XAI), specifically, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) which generates mapping between AI decision and biomarker used by the ophthalmologist whereby enhancing results interpretability and transparency in the disease diagnostic tasks. VGG-16 incorporated with batch normalization and label smoothing was used for the classification tasks whereas LRP was employed to perform the heat-map generation to see if the feature extracted and used by AI was consistent with the experts’ biomarkers. Our proposed model obtained a classification accuracy of 77.33%, where 165 out of 266 images were aligned with the ophthalmologist’s prediction. Furthermore, the significance of heatmap generation was supported by a one-sample Z-test which revealed that the alignment between AI predictions and expert biomarkers is significantly greater than random, with a 95% confidence interval.

AB  - Liability of lung cancer as a primary cancer mortality agent around the world makes it vital to create diagnostic systems that guarantee both accuracy and operational efficiency. This investigation establishes a hybrid detection methodology which uses CNNs for extracting image features from CT scans alongside SVMs for classification to improve lung cancer identification performance. The combined CNN-SVM model attained top performance with 95.2% accuracy surpassing the 91.5% CNN model correctness and 88.3% correctness from the SVM model. The sensitivity of the hybrid model reached 94.8%, and its specificity was 95.6%, demonstrating superior performance in correctly identifying malignant and benign cases compared to CNN (sensitivity: 90.2%, specificity: 92.8%) and SVM (sensitivity: 87.9%, specificity: 88.7%). With an AUC of 0.98 CNN-SVM demonstrated superior discriminative capability than CNN's model at 0.94 and SVM's model at 0.91. The confusion matrix analysis validated this model because it correctly determined 476 malignant and 478 benign cases among 500 total cases resulting in 2.4% misclassification. Analysis of both training and validation loss curves exhibited proper convergence with insignificant overfitting because readings stabilized at 0.05 for training and 0.08 for validation data. The hybrid model demonstrates improved lung cancer detection which validates its medical application potential as an effective solution. Further research will stretch dataset boundaries while adding multi-class categorization and exploring clearer results through explainable AI methods.

AB  - Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that frequently results in tissue damage, organ failure, and mortality as a result of the body's extreme response to infection. It is imperative to implement early detection to enhance patient outcomes and alleviate healthcare burdens. A groundbreaking model called SEP-XTree was developed for early sepsis prediction. Data preprocessing, mean imputation for missing values, correlation-based approaches for handling missing values, and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) for key feature selection are all components of the proposed methodology. To make sure there was a fair representation of both sepsis and non-sepsis patients, the SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) was used to rectify class imbalance. After analyzing six different machine learning models, the Extra Trees Classifier stood out with an exceptional 99% F1-score, 99.5% recall, and accuracy. The robustness and absence of overfitting in the model were verified by cross-validation. Along with shedding light on the significance of features, the LIME method improved the model's interpretability. The proposed model exhibits exceptional clinical relevance, accuracy, and reliability for the early detection of sepsis.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) enabled IoT is a significant paradigm that has been proliferating to new heights in recent years. IoT is a smart technology in which the physical objects or the things that are ubiquitously around us are networked and linked to the internet to deliver new services and enhance efficiency. The primary objective of the IoT is to connect all the physical objects or the things of the world under a common infrastructure, allowing humans to control them and get timely, frequent updates on their status. These things or devices connected to IoT generate, gather and process a massive volume of binary data. This massive volume of data generated from these devices is analyzed and learned by AI algorithms and techniques that aid in providing users with better services. Thus, AI-enabled IoT or artificial IoT (AIoT) is a hybrid technology that merges AI with IoT and is capable of simplifying complicated and strenuous tasks with ease and efficiency. The various machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms in IoT are necessary to ensure the IoT network’s improved security and confidentiality. Furthermore, this paper also surveys the various architectures that form the backbone of IoT and AIoT. Moreover, the myriad state-of-the-art ML and DL-based approaches for securing IoT, including detecting anomalies/intrusions, authentication and access control, attack detection and mitigation, preventing distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, and analyzing malware in IoT, are also enlightened. In addition, this work also reviews the role of AIoT in optimizing network efficiency, securing IoT infrastructures, and addressing key challenges. Furthermore, it explores cutting-edge technologies like blockchain, 6G-enabled AIoT, federated learning (FL), and hyperdimensional (HD) computing, indicating their potential in advancing IoT and AIoT-driven applications within sectors like healthcare, autonomous systems, and industrial automation. Therefore, based on the plethora of prevailing significant works, the objective of this manuscript is to provide a comprehensive survey that expounds on AIoT in terms of security, architecture, applications, emerging technologies, and challenges.

AB  - Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disease that severely impairs cognitive function. Early detection is critical for effective treatment and management. Machine Learning (ML) methods are often used to ensure early detection and prediction. However, ML has various issues, including the data island problem. The fragmentation that results from the data island problem makes building reliable, effective ML models more complex, and it is particularly problematic in industries where privacy is a concern, like healthcare. Federated Learning (FL) can help tackle the data island problem by keeping sensitive patient data decentralized and enabling many institutions to work together on model training without exchanging raw data, all while maintaining privacy compliance. As Random Forest (RF) is proven to be the best-performing classifier in this research, an RF classifier is used to create FL. The model incorporates multiple data modalities, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) segmentation and clinical and psychological data, to capture the variety of characteristics influencing the progress of AD. Another concerning issue with ML is its uninterpretable character. We use SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques that emphasize important factors impacting model decisions in order to improve predictability and transparency. This explainability promotes confidence in AI-based diagnoses by enabling researchers and physicians to comprehend the underlying mechanisms guiding the predictions. The combination of XAI, FL, and Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3) Multimodal data offers an interpretable, scalable, reliable, and privacy-centered solution for multiple complex issues, such as predicting AD. This approach results in better diagnosis precision, greater security, and increased confidence in AI technologies, making it a novel methodology in medical sciences. With data privacy maintained, our method produces 98.93% accurate predictions, providing a solid detection strategy for AD. The suggested approach’s F1-score, Precision, Recall, and AUC are 98.93%, 98.94%, 98.93%, and 99.97%, respectively. This work also shows that a multimodal dataset performs better than a single modal dataset.

AB  - Diabetes is a chronic condition affecting blood sugar regulation and impacts a significant portion of the global population. Early detection is crucial, as it can help reduce complications and improve health outcomes. Many cybercrime attacks are directed toward the healthcare sector, underscoring the importance of secure data handling. In this study, we use a dataset to predict diabetes risk, employing Machine Learning (ML) which offers a powerful means for accurate prediction by leveraging complex patterns in health data, yet privacy concerns around sensitive medical information remain a significant challenge. This study addresses this concern by incorporating Differential Privacy (DP), specifically utilizing the Laplacian Mechanism (LM), to protect patient data. We employ a range of ML algorithms, including Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT), Bootstrap Aggregating (Bagging), and Stacked Generalization (Stacking), to ensure robust model performance. Using the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) for statistical analysis, our results reveal that even under DP constraints, the XGB model achieves an impressive accuracy of 89.43% while providing superior privacy protections. In contrast, without DP constraints, the RF model reaches a higher accuracy of 98.27%. To enhance interpretability, we integrate Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques such as Shapley Additive explanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), allowing us to understand the influence of individual features on the model's predictions. Our study also employs 10-fold cross-validation to confirm the model’s stability and reliability. This approach not only supports accurate and private diabetes prediction but also paves the way for the application of DP in broader healthcare ML applications, balancing data privacy with predictive utility.

AB  - The goal of this analysis is to use a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) based therapeutic reminder system and tracker. To increase monitoring accuracy and facilitate observance, this involves comparing K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Two groups were assessed in this study. Group 1 on the other hand, utilized the classical KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) algorithm for medication tracking, also processing 25 same samples. Group 2 used an AI-powered medication reminder and tracking system, equipped with a reinforcement learning algorithm, and processed 25 samples. The study’s main objective was to calculate and compare the accuracy of these two systems. The G Power value was set at 80%, and the threshold was set at 0.05% with a 95% confidence interval. The accuracy that the reinforcement learning-based medication reminder and tracker AI performed in Group 2 was 92%, which showed a higher accuracy rate than that of Group 1, which used a KNN algorithm and scored 78%. In addition, the AI could respond faster and predict reminder with an improved rate of reliability, hence providing better results. The AI-based medication reminder and tracker system, powered by the reinforcement learning algorithm, significantly outperforms the traditional KNN algorithm in terms of accuracy, speed, and managing complex medication schedules. Its ability to handle a variety of user behaviors and deliver timely reminders ensures a more reliable and efficient medication tracking experience.

AB  - The liver is a critical organ responsible for diverse physiological functions, yet it remains highly susceptible to damage from alcohol, medications, and metabolic imbalances. Conventional diagnostic approaches, such as blood panels and imaging, are often costly and time-consuming, delaying early detection. This study presents an interpretable machine learning framework designed to enhance liver disease prognosis by leveraging ensemble methods, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and LightGBM. To address real-world data challenges, the framework incorporates advanced preprocessing techniques, including dimensionality optimization and class rebalancing strategies, ensuring robust model generalization. Beyond predictive performance, the model integrates state-of-the-art explainability tools—SHAP and LIME—to offer both global and local interpretability of predictions. SHAP summary, force, and dependence plots highlight feature importance and interactions, while LIME provides transparent, instance-level justifications. This dual-layered interpretability facilitates clinician trust, offering a transparent and scalable decision support system for early, explainable, and accessible liver disorder diagnosis, particularly in resource-limited healthcare settings.

AB  - Cancer remains one of the most challenging diseases to treat in the medical field. Machine learning (ML) has enabled in-depth analysis of complex patterns from large, diverse datasets, greatly facilitating “healthcare automation” in cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Despite these advancements, ML models face challenges stemming from limited labeled sample sizes, the intricate interplay of high-dimensionality data types, the inherent heterogeneity observed among patients and within tumors, and concerns about interpretability and consistency with existing biomedical knowledge. One approach to address these challenges is to integrate biomedical knowledge into data-driven models, which has proven potential to improve the accuracy, robustness, and interpretability of model results. Here, we review the state-of-the-art ML studies that leverage the fusion of biomedical knowledge and data, termed knowledge-informed machine learning (KIML), to advance cancer diagnosis and prognosis. We provide an overview of diverse forms of knowledge representation and current strategies of knowledge integration into machine learning pipelines with concrete examples. We conclude the review article by discussing future directions aimed at leveraging KIML to advance cancer research and healthcare automation. A live summary of the review is hosted at https://lingchm.github.io/kinformed-machine-learning-cancer/ offering an evolving resource to support research in this field.Note to Practitioners—Recognizing the challenges posed by inter-patient and intratumoral heterogeneity, constrained sample size, and interpretability requirements in cancer applications, practitioners should consider integration of existing biomedical knowledge into their modeling frameworks. This strategy holds promise for enhancing model performance, robustness, and interpretability. We review classic machine learning and deep learning models that incorporated domain knowledge in their cancer diagnosis and prognosis models spanning models that use clinical, imaging, molecular, and treatment data. Pros and cons of each integration approach are discussed. Key design questions such as which knowledge to leverage, how to represent it effectively, and how to seamlessly integrate it into their models need be examined for each case. Collaboration between modeling scientists and medical experts is essential in this endeavor.

AB  - The progressive nature of liver disease makes it a worrying factor globally and is often detected too late, where treatment options are sparse. As with most diseases, early detection makes a significant difference to the outcomes a patient faces and the resources that need to be devoted by the healthcare system. The purpose of this paper is to propose a predictive model for liver disease detection with the implementation of Deep Learning TabNet architecture, which is specialized in analyzing structured data. In contrast to other models, TabNet uses a novel approach that improves feature selection and overall accuracy through the use of attention mechanisms. The system’s non-stop surveillance of patient data enables it to report irregularities followed by real-time alerts for timely action to be taken. Additionally, batch data processing allows for a thorough analysis of the data that captures various trends for proactive disease control. The enhancement of deep learning for the predictive factors of liver disease is expected to strengthen preventive medicine and make further strides in AI diagnostics and patient care. The proposed TabNet model achieves a recall of 0.991, precision of 0.992, and an F1 score of 0.991 at a learning rate of 0.0015, demonstrating exceptional performance in accurately identifying liver disease.

AB  - Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) can uncover the inner workings of black-box models, enhancing transparency and building trust in AI-driven decision-making. However, there is ongoing debate regarding the effectiveness of XAI explanations specifically, whether they are understandable to users lacking technical knowledge, have low digital literacy or the confidence of a user to question an automated decision based on an AI model outcome. To address these challenges, we propose adapting metrics, adopted from cognitive psychology’s Mental Model approach to assess non-specialist (non-technical) participants’ understanding of two different types (SHAP, example-based) of XAI explanation. Utilizing a Healthcare scenario, we create a random forest model to classify a cancer diagnosis and create a series of explanation types. This paper presents a study to evaluate the effectiveness of these explanation types using metrics including understanding, trust, and perceived usefulness with non-specialist users. The results show that non-specialist users who had received one training session in SHAP trusted the SHAP explanation more than the example-based explanation, however 81% of participants thought that example-based explanations were more useful.

AB  - Healthcare systems face challenges in objectively evaluating clinician performance and allocating resources efficiently. This study proposes a machine learning (ML) framework to classify doctors based on clinical outcomes, predict future performance, and enhance decision-making using the MIMIC-III database. We extracted structured (lab results, treatment histories) and unstructured (clinical notes) data to train four ML models: Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, and Neural Networks. Random Forest achieved the highest classification accuracy (85%, AUC-ROC: 0.89), while XGBoost excelled in precision (82%) and recall (79%). Model interpretability was ensured using SHAP values, and rigorous validation (5-fold cross-validation, external eICU dataset) confirmed generalizability. Our results demonstrate that ML-driven clinician evaluation improves resource allocation, reduces diagnostic errors by 18%, and enhances patient satisfaction. This work bridges the gap between predictive analytics and healthcare management, offering actionable insights for hospitals to optimize care delivery.

AB  - The growing need for easily available healthcare combined with the strain on healthcare personnel demands the creation of intelligent technologies able to automate patient evaluation and best use of resource allocation. Healthcare systems are currently sometimes overwhelmed, particularly in severe situations where quick response is very vital. Usually requiring manual intervention for first diagnosis, current systems can cause delays and maybe aggravate patient problems. Automating the health assessment process using a survey system grounded in machine learning helps to solve this problem. Analyzing replies from a series of health-related queries using a neural network, the system forecasts the patient's condition's degree and assigns it either mild, moderate, or severe classification. The technology automatically offers the patient pertinent drug recommendations for mild and moderate conditions. Severe situations call for a visit to a medical practitioner who will write the required prescription for a drug. To help consumers self-manage minor health problems, a chatbot is included into the program to provide quick answers connected to symptoms, precautions, and solutions for many health concerns. Moreover, the system keeps getting better by means of real-time data-driven insights gathered. This helps to increase the accuracy of next evaluations. This approach helps the system to guarantee that severe patients get quick medical attention, simplify healthcare delivery, and lower wait times.

AB  - In recent years, precision medicine aims to enhance cancer treatment based on the molecular profile of individual tumors but identifying the most effective drug for a specific cancer type remains a significant challenge. However existing models such as Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and other existing model struggle to capture the complex, heterogeneous interactions among drugs, genes, and cell lines, and often lack interpretability and biological reasoning. To resolve these issues, a novel framework integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNN) with Hierarchical Proximal Policy Optimization (HPPO) which is named as GNN-HPPO is proposed. Initially, the data is collected from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) datasets which comprises of drug response data and molecular profiles of cancer cell lines. Initially, in the preprocessing stage, gene expression and drug features are log-transformed to determine drug sensitivity, then normalized using min-max normalization. Further, a heterogeneous graph is constructed to model interactions between drugs, genes, and cell lines, and a GNN is applied to learn relational embeddings. Furthermore, for drug recommendation, HPPO is incorporated where a high-level policy selects drug classes and a low-level policy recommends specific drugs.

AB  - In the field of medical image analysis, medical image classification is one of the most fundamental and critical tasks. Current researches often rely on the off-the-shelf backbone networks derived from the field of computer vision, hoping to achieve satisfactory classification performance for medical images. However, given the characteristics of medical images, such as scattered distribution and varying sizes of lesions, features extracted with a single scale from the existing backbones often fail to perform accurate medical image classification. To this end, we propose a novel multi-scale learning paradigm, namely MUlti-SCale Learning with trusted Evidences (MUSCLE), which extracts and integrates features from different scales based on the theory of evidence, to generate the more comprehensive feature representation for the medical image classification task. Particularly, the proposed MUSCLE first estimates the uncertainties of features extracted from different scales/stages of the classification backbone as the evidences, and accordingly form the opinions regarding to the feature trustworthiness via a set of evidential deep neural networks. Then, these opinions on different scales of features are ensembled to yield an aggregated opinion, which can be used to adaptively tune the weights of multi-scale features for scatteredly distributed and size-varying lesions, and consequently improve the network capacity for accurate medical image classification. Our MUSCLE paradigm has been evaluated on five publicly available medical image datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed MUSCLE not only improves the accuracy of the original backbone network, but also enhances the reliability and interpretability of model decisions with the trusted evidences (https://github.com/Q4CS/MUSCLE).

AB  - Millions of people worldwide, irrespective of age or gender, suffer from thyroid abnormalities, which are among the most prevalent endocrine diseases. By secreting hormones like thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), the thyroid gland, which is situated in the neck, is essential in controlling a number of metabolic processes. Numerous body processes, such as metabolism, heart rate, temperature regulation, and energy production, are impacted by these hormones. Conditions include goiter, thyroid nodules, hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid), hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid), and thyroid cancer can arise from any interference with this gland's normal function. Such disorders can go misdiagnosed for extended periods of time due to their sometimes vague and subtle symptoms, which, if left untreated, might result in problems. Using patient health data, this study explores the use of machine learning (ML) techniques to the thyroid illness detection process. In particular, this study investigates three categorization algorithms: Categorical Boosting (CatBoost), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). A publicly accessible thyroid illness dataset with a variety of clinical characteristics was used to train these models.

AB  - Radiation pneumonia is a serious complication for head and neck cancer patients receiving radiation therapy, so it is important to estimate the risk accurately. In the study, a combination of XGBoost and LightGBM models is used, with XGBoost as the meta learner, to estimate radiation pneumonia. To manage the large difference between the number of pneumonia and non-pneumonia cases (568 pneumonia vs. 1914 non-pneumonia cases), the SMOTETomek resampling approach was used on the training data. Moreover, with SHAP analysis, the changes in how each feature affected the predictions between the original imbalanced and the balanced data were clearly seen. Based on the experimental evaluation over the considered dataset, the precision, recall, F1-Score, F2-Score, and ROC-AUC have improved significantly. The study reveals that the approach proposed can predict well while giving simple and meaningful insights to doctors. The developed model may enable oncologists to understand and provide insights into AI-driven decision-making to make informed decisions.

AB  - Pseudogenes, once regarded as genomic relics, have emerged as critical regulators of gene expression, influencing cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and developmental processes. This study introduces an advanced framework for pseudogene classification, leveraging deep learning to address the challenges of large-scale transcriptomic analysis. The proposed approach integrates an autoencoder for dimensionality reduction, a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) for synthetic data generation, and a TabNet classifier for final prediction. Extensive literature on pseudogenes highlights their interaction with coding genes, non-coding RNAs, and epigenetic mechanisms, which are pivotal in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. The pipeline uses SMOTE to mitigate class imbalance and applies synthetic feature augmentation to boost classification performance. Tested on a large-scale curated transcriptomic dataset, our framework achieves an accuracy of 96%, surpassing traditional machine learning models. Visualization tools such as t-SNE, heatmaps, and SHAP plots further enhance model interpretability. The system is fully implemented on accessible AI platforms (Google Colab, Kaggle), ensuring real-time simulation and reproducibility, especially for research teams with limited computational resources. This method offers a scalable, explainable solution for pseudogene identification and non-coding RNA characterization, with broad applications in cancer research, genome annotation, and precision transcriptomics. The results underscore the power of deep learning and generative models in unveiling the regulatory complexity of pseudogenes, contributing to future genomic studies and clinical precision medicine. Additionally, a user-friendly Gradio interface has been developed, enabling interactive exploration and prediction of pseudogene classes, providing a practical tool for biologists and clinicians alike.

AB  - Machine learning (ML) is demonstrating remarkable success in various healthcare applications. The success of ML in healthcare is inherently linked to the rigorous process of feature engineering and feature selection, which truly forms the backbone of ML model development. This study investigates the role of a well-known large language model (LLM), the ChatGPT-4o, in feature selection and classification processes for healthcare data, focusing on the explainability of ML. The performance of ChatGPT-4o is evaluated and compared to traditional ML methods—such as information gain (IG), correlation-based feature selection (CFS), and principal component analysis (PCA) for identifying relevant features in predictive modeling. This comparison is conducted using two widely recognized healthcare datasets, SEER and NSQIP. After evaluating the features selected by classical ML methods and LLMs through expert review, the results indicate that while ChatGPT-4o aligns closely with expert evaluations and effectively provides contextual information on healthcare datasets, traditional ML methods such as IG, CFS, and PCA outperform in systematic feature ranking due to their structured and data-driven nature. Furthermore, anonymization did not significantly affect the feature selection process, highlighting the robustness of ChatGPT-4o under privacy-preserving conditions. ChatGPT-4o’s strength lies in complementing these methods by providing interpretability and facilitating exploratory analysis, rather than serving as a standalone solution for precise feature ranking.CCS Concepts• Computing methodologies → Feature selection; Information extraction.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming sectors such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems, offering powerful tools for innovation. Yet its rapid integration raises urgent ethical concerns related to data ownership, privacy, and systemic bias. Issues like opaque decision-making, misleading outputs, and unfair treatment in high-stakes domains underscore the need for transparent and accountable AI systems.This article addresses these challenges by proposing a modular ethical assessment framework built on ontological blocks of meaning—discrete, interpretable units that encode ethical principles such as fairness, accountability, and ownership. By integrating these blocks with FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles, the framework supports scalable, transparent, and legally aligned ethical evaluations, including compliance with the EU AI Act.Using a real-world use case in AI-powered investor profiling, the paper demonstrates how the framework enables dynamic, behavior-informed risk classification. The findings suggest that ontological blocks offer a promising path toward explainable and auditable AI ethics, though challenges remain in automation and probabilistic reasoning.

This article proposes a hybrid architecture for healthcare fraud detection, combining deep learning-based feature representation with gradient boosting classification and explainable AI techniques. The framework integrates convolutional neural networks (CNNs), transformers, and XGBoost to capture intricate patterns in claims data while maintaining interpretability through Shapley additive explanations. The model we proposed was tested on two datasets: the Medicare Provider Fraud dataset and the Healthcare Providers dataset. On the Medicare dataset, the framework achieved an F1-score of 0.95 on the training set and 0.92 on the test set, with an AUC-ROC of 0.98 and 0.97, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art models such as LightGBM and CatBoost. On the Healthcare Providers dataset, the framework attained a test F1-score of 0.92 and an AUC-ROC of 0.96, consistently surpassing traditional models like Support Vector Machines and Random Forest. Key contributions include integrating domain-specific features, such as provider-patient interaction graphs and temporal patterns, and using explainability techniques to enhance trustworthiness. Furthermore, the framework demonstrated computational efficiency, with a training time of 150 seconds on the primary dataset, making it suitable for real-world deployment.

AB  - Stroke is a primary cause of disability and mortality globally, necessitating rapid and precise prediction for effective prevention. Conventional machine learning models have difficulties in achieving a balance among accuracy, interpretability, and real-time application. This study introduces the BoostStack Framework, a hybrid ensemble methodology that integrates LightGBM with a meta-model to improve performance. A comprehensive assessment of a real-world dataset illustrates the efficacy of the suggested system, attaining an accuracy of 97.2%, precision of 95.8%, recall of 96.5%, and AUC-ROC of 98.2%. These outcomes surpass conventional approaches, including Decision Trees and Logistic Regression. The BoostStack Framework incorporates feature significance analysis, guaranteeing interpretability while preserving robust predictive capability. The system's implementation in intelligent healthcare environments facilitates real-time risk evaluation using IoT devices and cloud-based technologies. This research significantly enhances AI-driven healthcare analytics, improving early stroke prediction skills.

AB  - The sensor-based recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) in smart-home environments enables applications in healthcare, including monitoring behavioral changes in older adults to detect cognitive decline. However, traditional deep learning approaches face two key challenges: reliance on large labeled datasets and lack of transparency. This research explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address these challenges. To mitigate data scarcity, we tested LLMs as substitutes for knowledge models in neuro-symbolic approaches and evaluated their ability to recognize activities from sensor data. For explainability, we developed methods to assess LLM-generated explanations and investigated whether LLMs, in addition to classifying activities, can generate effective natural language explanations. Overall, our findings suggest that LLMs can enhance ADLs recognition by alleviating data and explainability limitations, though challenges remain, which are discussed in this work.

AB  - A full pneumonia detection system, based on a modified version of the VGG16 architecture of convolutional neural networks that has been perfected for chest X-ray image analysis is developed. Model achieves state-of-the-art results with diagnostic accuracy of 96.7, precision of 95.8, and recall of 97.5, surpassing existing state-of-the-art approaches based on DenseNet121, InceptionV3, ResNet50, and MobileNetV2 architectures. The model allows for visibility into decision making and learning via Grad-CAM interpretability visualizations that show pneumonia-affected areas to support explainable and human-centered AI decision support in diagnostic procedures. To provide ease of use for patients or clinicians, this have designed and developed an intuitive web application via Flask that allows users to upload chest X-rays for real-time pneumonia detection, plus educational content about preventative measures and treatments. This application has been clinically validated among healthcare providers, and the findings show significant improvements in providing pneumonia care. The improvements include an overall time to diagnosis reduction of 33, early pneumonia diagnoses rates improved by 22, and an overall cost savings of 14.8. Further, validation of the system across diverse patient groups confirmed the robustness of performance across age groups, with excellent results in pediatric patients. Additionally, the lightweight application provides a way to take pneumonia detection in radiology and provide solutions in low-resource environments with a high level of diagnostic accuracy.
