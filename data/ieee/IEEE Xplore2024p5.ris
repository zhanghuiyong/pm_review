AB  - AI models and especially deep learning models have found applications across various medical domains. While many studies focus on using electronic health records (EHRs) data to train AI models, implementing the reverse process poses several challenges. Also, the heterogeneous nature of the used data in EHRs, such as diagnoses, clinical reports, test results, prescriptions, and medical images, makes their interpretation difficult for the practitioners which require a unified understanding. Medical ontologies are useful to improve data interpretability and semantics. In this paper, we aim to create a synergy between ontologies and deep learning techniques to enhance efficiency, data understanding, and provide healthcare quality. We propose a system in which our developed ontology is populated automatically using the predictions of an AI model. We have developed and trained a CNN model to aid in the COVID-19 diagnosis. The initial obtained results are promising with an accuracy of 98%.

AB  - Accurate and timely diagnosis of crop diseases is crucial for food security and agricultural sustainability. Current methods lack accuracy, interpretability, data integration, and advanced imaging techniques. The current research aims to address such issues by proposing a broad-perspective approach that brings into play hyperspectral imaging in tandem with 3D reconstruction, multimodal data integration, advanced machine learning models, and finally, trickled-down with XAI techniques. Up to now, approaches in the detection of crop diseases have been basically dependent on RGB imaging information and single-information sources that are incapable of accounting for interactions amidst the variety of factors affecting crop health. These methods have poor spatial and spectral analysis; thus, leading to limited accuracy and also offering little elucidation on the implication of the models. Overcoming these limitations, we employed a hyperspectral imaging approach with the 3D reconstruction for achieving fine spectral and spatial quantification of the crops. Through this approach, accuracy in disease detection was improved from 85% to 92%, and this approach drives a holistic view of the crops. Through data fusion, hyperspectral images, soil health parameters, and weather data were integrated. Their integration significantly improved the predictive accuracy—all the way up to 89% from 78% overall accuracy. We also developed an explainable Transformer-based deep learning model with in-built attention mechanisms and Grad-CAM for explainability. Such an advanced model architecture allowed draft feature extraction and provided visual explanations on the decisions made by the model, increasing classification accuracy from 88% to 94% and interpretability by 70%. A combination of hyperspectral imaging, data fusion, and advanced machine learning with XAI improves the model's accuracy and its robustness and therefore improves the latter's transparency in the decision-making process.

AB  - Machine learning methods have become instrumental in the prediction of heart diseases, offering a potent means of early detection and personalized risk assessment. By harnessing various algorithms and techniques, these models analyze extensive datasets encompassing patient demographics, medical histories, and clinical measurements. The interpretability of machine learning models remains a pertinent issue, as the complex algorithms often lack transparency, hindering clinicians’ understanding of the underlying decision-making process. Furthermore, model bias and generalization issues can arise, particularly when datasets are not representative of diverse populations or when algorithms are trained on data from specific healthcare settings. Addressing these challenges requires a concerted effort to improve data collection practices, enhance model interpretability, mitigate bias, and ensure equitable access to healthcare technologies. This paper proposed the Entropy Hidden Markov Model (EHMM) for heart disease prediction. The proposed EHMM model uses the estimation of entropy with consideration of local and global features for the estimation of modalities in the heart. With the estimated entropy Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is employed for disease detection and prevention. With the proposed EHMM the feature points are computed for the heart diseases. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed EHMM model achieves a higher prediction rate of 0.98 with minimal loss than the conventional ML with the classifiers SVM and RF.

AB  - Brain tumor classification is a critical aspect of medical diagnosis, where accuracy and speed can significantly impact patient outcomes. The core problem in medical image analysis is the scarcity of labeled data, especially in complex tasks like brain tumor classification, where gathering labeled samples can be costly and time-consuming. Standard self-training approaches often fail in such settings due to overconfidence in incorrect predictions, leading to error propagation. To address these challenges, Confidence Regularized Self-Training for Brain Tumor Classification (CRST-BTC), an approach that enhances classification accuracy in limited data is proposed. To enhance interpretability, the research uses Explainable AI (XAI) using the SHAP framework, offering transparency in feature importance. Comparing the suggested approach to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models demonstrates its competitive advantage. The research thoroughly examines the effects of using different proportions of unlabeled data and evaluates various backbone networks, with VGG16 emerging as the top performer. The model shows optimal performance when 60% of the data is unlabeled, paired with a confidence threshold of 0.9. Notably, the VGG16 backbone achieves an accuracy of 97.01%. This research advances the field and offers important insights for professionals working in medical image analysis.

AB  - Diabetes is a life-threatening chronic condition af-fecting millions worldwide., making timely prediction and risk classification crucial for effective intervention. Various machine learning techniques., such as deep learning., decision trees., random forests., and support vector machines (SVM)., have been applied to this task., but they face significant challenges. These challenges in-clude handling imbalanced datasets., optimizing hyperparameters., preventing overfitting., and maintaining high accuracy while en-suring interpretability. Additionally., adapting models for person-alized treatment based on clinical and demographic data requires precise hyperparameter tuning., which can be time-consuming and complex. This study addresses these challenges by introducing an Optuna optimization framework for diabetes prediction and clas-sification. Optuna is a powerful hyperparameter optimization tool that efficiently explores the parameter space to identify optimal configurations for improved model performance. Using a compre-hensive dataset of diabetic patients., we apply machine learning models such as logistic regression., SVM., and random forests., which are fine-tuned through Optuna's automatic tuning process. The results demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy., precision., recall., and Fl-score over conventional methods., leading to better diabetes prediction and risk stratification. This study highlights the potential of Optuna to enhance machine learning models., improving their applicability in clinical settings.

AB  - The ability to recognize fine-grained gestures enables several applications in different domains, including healthcare, robotics, remote control, and human-computer interaction. Traditional gesture recognition systems rely on data acquired from cameras, depth sensors, or smart gloves. More recently, techniques for recognizing gestures based on signals acquired by high-density (HD) EMG electrodes worn on the forearm have been proposed. An advantage of these techniques is that they do not rely on the use of external devices, and they are feasible also to people who underwent amputation. Unfortunately, the extraction of complex features from raw HD EMG signals may introduce delays that deter the real-time requirements of the system. To address this issue, in a preliminary investigation we proposed to use graph neural networks for gesture recognition from raw HD EMG data. In this paper, we extend our previous work by exploiting Explainable AI algorithms to automatically refine the graph topology based on the data in order to improve recognition rates and reduce the computational cost. We performed extensive experiments with a large dataset collected from 20 volunteers regarding the execution of 65 fine-grained gestures, comparing our technique with state-of-the-art methods based on handcrafted features and different machine learning algorithms. Experimental results show that our technique outperforms the state of the art in terms of recognition performance while incurring significantly lower computational cost at run-time.

AB  - The objective of this study is to address the lack of research in assessing and measuring the movement of the human neck in connection to the direction and intensity of head impacts, with the goal of enhancing safety measures in healthcare. This work specifically examines the application of explainable artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models to accurately predict the orientation of the neck by analysing muscle forces. The aim is to communicate these findings in a manner that aids doctors in making informed decisions. The experimental setup was designed to replicate four types of fairly severe head impacts, namely flexion and lateral displacement, which are frequently seen in median American football crashes. In total, there were ten participants, consisting of five males and five females. Biomechanical modelling and simulation using the Open Sim program enabled the determination and visualization of the neck direction in inverse dynamics study of the spine. This study utilized the annotated tendon force muscle data obtained from studies to train many machines learning models, including a sequential neural network. Among these models, the XGB classifier achieved superior accuracy, having a neck direction accuracy rate of 98%. Considering the accuracy rates established in previous investigations, the findings of this research have promise for comparison with other studies in the same field of inquiry. By integrating explainable AI techniques, the interpretability of predictions generated by machine learning algorithms is enhanced. The knowledge supplied is valuable for comprehending the generated findings. This work contributes to the expansion of knowledge on the biomechanics of the neck during head impacts and emphasizes the use of an AI-based system to improve early preventive mechanisms and assist in the decision-making process for injury management.

AB  - Depression is a common mental health disorder. It significantly affects millions of people's daily lives all around the world. Despite the high incidence of depression and limited treatment options, many people are hesitant to seek professional help. Researchers are now exploring the use of wearable technology to collect personalized physiological data, which has recently been applied to provide healthcare services. Depression can be recognized with the help of machine learning using motor activity data collected by the ActiGraph wristband. Large data samples and higher effectiveness are necessary for developing a reliable and robust machine-learning model. However such quantitative and relevant clinical data are not openly available. This study used the depresjon (depression in Norwegian) dataset consisting of time-series data on the activity of only 23 depressed and 32 healthy individuals. However, a data augmentation technique was used that increased the number of samples from 693 to 5500. Among these algorithms, XGBoost obtained an impressive accuracy of 98.8% in 10-fold cross-validation, which met the requirements to accurately detect depression. In addition, this investigation highlighted different hidden patterns included in the time series of the two classes. Furthermore, this study utilized Explainable AI approaches, such as SHAP. These approaches further improve model transparency and interpretability. The explanation highlighted the significance of the statistical feature Median activity among features like Mean, Zero crossing rate, Standard deviation, etc. that significantly influence the model's decision-making process.

AB  - Objective: Early diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases is a crucial task in medical practice. With the application of computer audition in the healthcare field, artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied to clinical non-invasive intelligent auscultation of heart sounds to provide rapid and effective pre-screening. However, AI models generally require large amounts of data which may cause privacy issues. Unfortunately, it is difficult to collect large amounts of healthcare data from a single centre. Methods: In this study, we propose federated learning (FL) optimisation strategies for the practical application in multi-centre institutional heart sound databases. The horizontal FL is mainly employed to tackle the privacy problem by aligning the feature spaces of FL participating institutions without information leakage. In addition, techniques based on deep learning have poor interpretability due to their “black-box” property, which limits the feasibility of AI in real medical data. To this end, vertical FL is utilised to address the issues of model interpretability and data scarcity. Conclusion: Experimental results demonstrate that, the proposed FL framework can achieve good performance for heart sound abnormality detection by taking the personal privacy protection into account. Moreover, using the federated feature space is beneficial to balance the interpretability of the vertical FL and the privacy of the data. Significance: This work realises the potential of FL from research to clinical practice, and is expected to have extensive application in the federated smart medical system.

AB  - The transition of artificial intelligence (AI) from research to deployment has underscored the critical importance of leveraging data effectively in developing and evaluating AI models. Despite their pivotal role in determining performance, fairness, and robustness, data are often undervalued in AI research, lacking a data-centric focus. In response, the AI-DAPT project pioneers a data-centric approach that aligns with AI methodologies to address the pressing need for reliable and trustworthy AI systems.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a significant global threat to public health. In recent years, machine learning (ML) algorithms have emerged as tools for predicting AMR patterns and guiding antibiotic treatment decisions. This study explores the predictive capabilities of three ML algorithms, namely Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest (RF), with the incorporation of integron features along with AMR genes, to construct a web-based in silico antibiogram tool. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset comprising bacterial isolates - Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae and their corresponding resistance profiles to five antibiotics of interest - cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, and levofloxacin, the study train and evaluate the performance of the ML models. Generally, XGBoost and RF perform better than SVM with AUC score up to 0.93. Central to this approach is the integration of integron features, which play a pivotal role in mediating horizontal gene transfer and facilitating the dissemination of resistance genes among bacterial populations. Building upon the robust models, this study developed a user-friendly web application that enables healthcare practitioners and researchers to input whole-genome sequences and rapidly obtain predictions regarding antibiotic resistance profiles based on integrated ML models.

AB  - Heart disease is still a prominent cause of illness and fatal death worldwide. In this work, we examine whether the existence of heart disease can be predicted using the Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) algorithm from a tabular dataset that includes several clinical, lifestyle, and demographic factors. We did a substantial amount of feature engineering on the dataset to manage missing values and standardize features before training the GNB classifier to diagnose heart illness. We evaluate the supervised model using widely-used metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to show thst it distinguishes between people with and without heart disease. Using two state-of-the-art Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Modelagnostic Explanations), we shed light on the underlying mechanisms of the predictions made by the GNB model. The authors offer significant new insights into the prognostic potential of the GNB algorithm for heart disease. Our findings demonstrate the value of the dependability and transparency of machine learning models for significant healthcare applications

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is changing many fields, and putting it to use in supply chain management (SCM) creates both big possibilities and tough moral problems. This survey looks at unused patterns and the foremost imperative morals issues that come up when AI is utilized in supply chain administration frameworks. AI has changed SCM in a enormous way by making operations more productive, making forecasts more exact, and making decision-making way better. But these changes make me stress around things like decency, openness, and duty. Since AI programs aren't continuously clear approximately how they make choices, they can be one-sided and unjustifiable, particularly when it comes to contracting, buying things, and designating assets. This reliance on AI in SCM too makes shortcomings like hacking dangers and information protection issues. Expansive sums of information must be collected and utilized for AI to work, which implies that solid frameworks are required to secure information security and client security. The social and financial impacts of AI-driven SCM are another important morals issue to think almost. AI offers to create things more effective and cut costs, but on the off chance that it isn't taken care of reasonably, it seem put individuals out of work and make social and financial holes greater. To settle these issues, we require forceful approaches that put teaching specialists, work development in unused AI-related ranges, and open decision-making forms at the best of the list. Too, for AI to be used morally in SCM, there ought to be a set of clear rules and informational to decrease dangers and make beyond any doubt that the framework works with the rules set by controllers. This incorporates making rules for utilizing AI in an moral way, checking calculations for blemishes on a standard premise, and empowering openness in choices made by AI. Indeed with these issues, AI can offer assistance make SCM more feasible by progressing the strength of the supply chain, maximizing utilize of assets, and bringing down squander.

AB  - In the industrial sector, unplanned equipment failures can lead to significant financial losses, safety hazards, and operational inefficiencies. Traditional maintenance strategies, such as reactive maintenance (repair after failure) and preventive maintenance (scheduled maintenance), often prove inadequate in addressing these issues. This not only minimizes downtime but also optimizes maintenance resources and extends the lifespan of equipment. Machine learning models used in Predictive maintenance (PdM) are designed to analyze large volumes of data generated by industrial equipment. Reinforcement learning optimizes maintenance schedules by learning from interactions with the environment, balancing the trade-off between maintenance costs and equipment reliability. Black-box models, such as deep learning, often provide high accuracy but lack transparency. Explainable AI (XAI) techniques are being developed to make these models more interpretable, enabling users to gain insights into the decision-making process and build confidence in the predictions. The deployment of ML models in industrial environments also requires seamless integration with existing systems. This involves addressing issues related to real-time data processing, scalability, and model retraining. Edge computing and cloud-based solutions are being explored to handle large-scale data processing and storage, while online learning techniques allow models to adapt to new data continuously. This paper presents several case studies from industries such as manufacturing, energy, transportation, and healthcare, illustrating the successful application of ML in PdM. In manufacturing, ML models have been used to predict failures in machinery such as turbines, compressors, and conveyor belts, leading to significant reductions in downtime and maintenance costs. The energy sector has employed ML for the maintenance of critical infrastructure, including power grids and wind turbines, enhancing operational efficiency and reliability.

AB  - This study addresses the global healthcare system's challenge in managing chronic diseases by exploring how integrating Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) with machine learning can enhance predictive analytics, improving patient outcomes and reducing costs. EMRs provide extensive patient data, allowing the development of robust predictive models using Random Forests and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM). Analyzing anonymized EMR data from diverse populations ensures data quality and reveals critical predictors for conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and COPD, with a focus on predicting hospital readmissions and treatment adherence. The study demonstrates that while Random Forest models offer high interpretability and assist clinical decisions with 0.90 accuracy, GBM models, achieving a 0.92 accuracy, excel at capturing complex data relationships and outperform Random Forest in predictive performance. Integrating these models into Clinical Decision Support Systems enables healthcare providers to make data-driven, proactive, and personalized decisions for patients. The findings underscore the trans formative potential of EMR-driven machine learning in chronic disease management, setting a foundation for future work on model refinement and clinical impact assessment.

AB  - The identification of CHD in the early stage is crucial due to a high probability of death and ineffective treatment outcomes. This paper assesses the feasibility as well as clinical usefulness of several machine learning techniques in the early diagnosis of CHD. We employed a large set of data containing patients' features: demographic characteristics, health history, results of tests and diagnosis. The work of the study was to use Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and Neural Networks to estimate the probability of the incidence of CHD. Cohesion was performed using cross-validation for training and validation of the models with accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC study parameters. The findings of this study show that through machine learning, the identification and diagnosis of CHD early stages can be significantly improved with the RF model giving the highest accuracy. Challenges and possibilities of using these predictive tools in clinical practice are examined, with the focus on possible enhancements of patients' treatment and outcomes. Thus, the research under consideration proved that machine learning-based predictive models can be considered a promising avenue for the early diagnosis of CHD, which should be further explored and implemented.

AB  - To enhance the utilization of artificial intelligence in medicine and overcome challenges like inadequate feature extraction and poor interpretability in diagnostic methods, this paper introduces a multilevel feature-weighted fusion classification algorithm called Multi-scale Attention Fusion Net (MAFF-Net). Additionally, it proposes a mask perturbation interpretive method based on Class Activation Mapping (CAMMPA) to improve interpretability. MAFF-Net achieves deep feature mining and representation, along with weighted fusion, by mapping multi-scale complementary features operated by the attention mechanism to the same feature space. This facilitates the more accurate identification of subtle differences between medical images. CAM-MPA generates finer and more accurate heat maps to highlight the model’s focus areas, thereby revealing the basis of the model’s decision-making process. We validated the effectiveness and superiority of the improved classification model and interpretability methods on the Tongue image dataset of Yin deficiency syndrome and the COVID-19 Radiography dataset.

AB  - The rapid integration of interconnected healthcare devices, software, operating systems, and networks within the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has greatly advanced healthcare delivery. However, this interconnectivity also presents significant security challenges. Many IoMT devices lack robust security mechanisms, making them vulnerable to intrusion and cyber-attacks. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose FOID, a feature-optimized intrusion detection scheme (IDS) designed specifically for securing IoMT healthcare systems. FOID enhances the security and reliability of healthcare networks by efficiently detecting and mitigating security breaches, particularly unauthorized access attempts.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) and algorithmic decision-making are profoundly shaping various aspects of society, with applications in healthcare, business, education, etc. As these systems become more integral to high-stakes decisions, concerns about their transparency and interpretability are growing. To address these concerns, explainable AI (XAI) methods have been developed, with counterfactual explanations emerging as a powerful tool. Counterfactuals help users understand AI decisions by demonstrating how small changes in input could alter the outcome, providing a clear and intuitive way to interpret AI behavior. Despite their potential, generating valid, interpretable, and efficient counterfactual explanations is particularly challenging in time series domains, where data points are interdependent. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to counterfactual explanations guided by ShapeDTW Barycenter Averaging (ShapeDBA). By integrating ShapeDBA into the counterfactual generation process, we ensure that the produced explanations are not only valid and interpretable but also efficient to generate. Our approach provides counterfactuals that align closely with human intuition while maintaining the computational efficiency required for practical deployment. This work represents a significant step forward in the development of interpretable AI systems, particularly in the complex domain of time series analysis.

AB  - It is in this regard that ML in medical imaging is going to revolutionize diagnostic practices by increasing its accuracy and reducing variability. In the present study, therefore, a new hybrid machine learning model has been designed in which a convolutional neural network is fused with the decision tree algorithm to improvise the detection and classification of medical conditions from imaging data. The features are extracted through a CNN component, and with that, it discovers complicated patterns within the images. Then, after feature extraction, these features pass through a decision tree for the classification of images and allow a high interpretability, showing how the decisions are made. The model was trained on a variety of conditions dataset with 10,000 medical images and was further validated. These results allow for an overall accuracy for the detection of malignancy of 93.4%, sensitivity of 92%, and specificity of 94%. Concretely, this approach decreases by 6.5% the number of false positives compared to a standalone CNN alone, which proves to be very robust and reliable. Results such as those mentioned above underline the huge potential of hybrid ML models for medical diagnostics, which already could ensure a high degree of accuracy and interpretability necessary for clinical application. This work in the future shall address generalization to other imaging modalities and integration with more sophisticated machine learning techniques for improved performance.

AB  - Noninvasive and inexpensive, ultrasound imaging serves an essential function in the diagnosis of liver diseases. However, problems such as image variability, operator dependency, and ability to separate initial stages of disease diminish its efficiency. These issues best illustrate the growing imperative for better healthcare approaches that are not only sustainable, but also affordable in the context of low-resource locations. This study therefore aims at systematically compiling and reports on the most recent works in classification techniques, that is deep learning (DL), machine learning (ML) and transfer learning (TL) which are considered to provide solutions to above stated challenges. These AI formulations make them compatible with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly, Good Health and Well-Being since they offer the expensive and innovative methods of increasing the reliability of diagnostic outcomes and minimizing a human operator’s influence at a lowered price. These innovations enable the production of low-cost and easily scalable diagnostic solutions for liver disease, especially among the population that has no access to it. This review will demarcate and assess the different AI approaches used on the ultrasound imaging data to overcome the present barriers to ultrasound diagnosis in LRI while directing the future research towards efficient, inexpensive, and scalable resourceful diagnostic framework.

AB  - Lung cancer is a potentially fatal condition, posing significant challenges for early detection and treatment within the healthcare domain. Despite extensive efforts, the etiology and cure of cancer remain elusive. However, early detection offers hope for effective treatment. This study explores the application of image processing techniques, including noise reduction, feature extraction, and identification of cancerous regions within the lung, augmented by patient medical history data. Leveraging machine learning and image processing, this research presents a methodology for precise lung cancer categorization and prognosis. While computed tomography (CT) scans are a cornerstone of medical imaging, diagnosing cancer solely through CT scans remains challenging even for seasoned medical professionals. The emergence of computer-assisted diagnostics has revolutionized cancer detection and diagnosis. This study utilizes lung images from the Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC-IDRI) and evaluates various image preprocessing filters such as median, Gaussian, Wiener, Otsu, and rough body area filters. Subsequently, feature extraction employs the Karhunen-Loeve (KL) methodology, followed by lung tumor classification using a hybrid model comprising a One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) and a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). Experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a sensitivity of 99.14%, specificity of 90.00%, F -measure of 95.24%, and accuracy of 95%.

AB  - Biosensors and machine learning (ML) work well together, particularly in biotechnology, environmental monitoring, and healthcare. Biosensors are instruments that identify particular biological substances or organisms and produce signals that must be deciphered. To analyze these signals and extract useful information, machine learning (ML) is essential. The dataset used in this study was taken from Kaggle and consists of data from the Bioelectric Recognition Assay (BERA) based cell-based biosensor technology and the portable B.EL.D (Bio Electric Diagnostics) instrument created by EMBIO Diagnostics. The study focuses on comparing different machine-learning algorithms applied to the given dataset to improve the accuracy of biosensors in identifying certain biomolecules or pathogens. The machine learning techniques used in this study are binary classifiers, and the most suitable one is selected based on its performance and characteristics. The results show that Decision Tree, KNN, and Support Vector Machine applied with 5-fold cross-validation for the evaluation of the predictive model which can identify listeria in milk samples with an accuracy rate of about 99%. Reaching 99% accuracy with 5-fold cross-validation is a noteworthy accomplishment, particularly when comparing different algorithms. This thorough validation process guarantees the novel combination of robustness and generalizability in the obtained results. ROC curves were plotted for various classifiers to evaluate the model’s performance at the classification threshold. Explainable AI has been used to check the contribution of each feature to the output of the model.

AB  - During times of crisis, like in healthcare emergencies or disruptions in logistics and supply chains, decision-makers encounter significant challenges in managing resources efficiently. This study proposes an approach combining different information types and advanced computer techniques to improve how we handle crises. By looking at data connected with blockchain technology, we aim to understand crises better and help people make smarter decisions. We use a special kind of computer model called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to guess what might happen during a crisis, like how many people might get sick or if there might be problems with getting supplies. Our model is right about 87% of the time. To understand why the computer makes these guesses, we use a method called SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), which is widely known. However, we notice that SHAP sometimes doesn’t explain things well for the entire period we’re looking at. So, we suggest some changes to the SHAP method to explain things better for smaller parts of time. These changes help the method explain things better for small bits of time, but it might not be as good at explaining everything overall. To ensure our idea works, we compare our computer model’s guesses and explanations with those from other models that look at data differently. We show the good and bad parts of our method in different crises.

AB  - One neurodegenerative illness that presents a serious threat to world health is Alzheimer's disease (AD). Prompt and precise AD prediction is essential for prompt intervention and better patient outcomes. In this study, we provide an ensemble model that forecasts this disease by using the advantages of three powerful machine learning algorithms: Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression. The ensemble model combines these algorithms' various forecasting powers to improve performance. The ensemble architecture aims to maximize each model's unique strengths while limiting overfitting risk and making up for any shortcomings. In addition, we dissect each algorithm's unique contribution within the ensemble to reveal their synergistic benefits. The results reveal that our technique is successful in predicting Alzheimer's disease, with an amazing 92% accuracy rate. In addition to achieving high accuracy, the suggested ensemble model demonstrates resilience and interpretability, two qualities that are essential for the clinical use of predictive models. In pursuing better patient care, our research highlights the promise of combined modeling as a viable means of raising the preciseness of Alzheimer's illness prediction and opening the door to early identification and intervention.

Our proposed system employs GNN-based collaborative filtering to model complex patient-patient and patient-symptom relationships in a comprehensive graph structure. The system is designed to offer interpretable recommendations, explaining the reasoning behind diagnostic suggestions. The study focused on common chronic conditions in older adults, including high blood pressure, coronary heart disease, diabetes and stroke, as well as fractures, osteoporosis and arthritis. We used a graphical hybrid recommender system (GHRS) and a cooperative graph neural network (GCFNA and GCFYA) to predict hospital disease diagnosis. Encouragingly, both the GCFNA and GCFYA models achieved prediction accuracy rates of over 90%, highlighting the model's excellent performance in accurate predictions. The ultimate goal is to provide precise disease predictions for elderly patients, offer medical guidance, and enhance patient care in hospitals, particularly in managing chronic diseases.

AB  - The machine learning modeling process conventionally results in selecting a single model that maximizes a selected performance metric. However, this approach leads to abandoning a more profound analysis of slightly inferior models. Particularly in medical and healthcare studies, where the objective extends beyond predictions to generation of valuable insights, relying solely on a single model can result in misleading or incomplete conclusions. This problem is particularly pertinent when dealing with a set of models known as Rashomon set, with performance close to maximum one. Such a set can be numerous and may contain models describing the data in a different way, which calls for comprehensive analysis. This paper introduces a novel method to explore models in the Rashomon set, extending the conventional modeling approach. We propose the Rashomon_DETECT algorithm to detect models with different behavior. It is based on recent developments in the eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) field. To quantify differences in variable effects among models, we introduce the Profile Disparity Index (PDI) based on measures from functional data analysis. To illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, we showcase its application on real-world medical problem: predicting survival among hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) patients – a foundational case study. Additionally, we benchmark our approach on other medical data sets, demonstrating its versatility and utility in various contexts. If differently behaving models are detected in the Rashomon set, their combined analysis leads to more trustworthy conclusions, which is of vital importance for high-stakes applications such as medical applications.

AB  - Bad actors threaten medical imaging AI systems' dependability and safety, affecting patient care and diagnosis accuracy. A novel defense against this expanding threat is adversarial defense via ensemble integration. Explainable Feature-Based Defense (XFBD), Adversarial Training with Transfer Learning (ATTL), and Robust Classifier Augmentation (RCA) are three innovative techniques that have never been combined. RCA enhances training with controlled aggression. This allows the model to distinguish authentic medical imaging data from altered sources. ATTL makes transfer-learning-taught models more resistant to topic-specific hostile approaches. XFBD simplifies the defensive process, helping us comprehend how the model picks and fights different methods. A comparison indicates that ADEI always outperforms tried-and-true approaches. ADEI outperforms typical approaches in accuracy, sensitivity, precision, stability, interpretability, private protection, and computing cost. Strong safeguards are needed as AI-powered healthcare research becomes increasingly popular. As a lighthouse, ADEI protects everything from attack. The math behind each section and how they work together to strengthen the system make it valuable. ADEI advances AI-assisted healthcare's future. Testing instruments must be accurate and dependable in this industry.

AB  - In modern healthcare, preserving patient privacy while utilizing data for predictive analytics remains a critical challenge. Federated Learning (FL) provides an efficient strategy by providing decentralized model training around different institutions without requiring the transfer of sensitive patient in- formation. This study investigates the implementation of privacy- preserving FL for predictive healthcare, specifically targeting heart disease, kidney disease, and diabetes. Each client in the FL network trains a neural network locally on disease-specific datasets, followed by model aggregation using ensemble learning and knowledge distillation to enhance global model performance while ensuring data confidentiality. Empirical results reveal high predictive accuracies: 79.39% for heart disease, 92.45% for kidney disease, and 70.36% for diabetes. The ensemble models, which synthesize knowledge between clients, maintain these accuracy levels, underscoring the efficacy of FL in delivering robust, privacy-preserving diagnostic models. These findings demonstrate the potential of FL to securely integrate data from multiple healthcare institutions, offering a pathway for scalable, decentralized predictive models in clinical settings. Further studies include the incorporation of more advanced deep learning architectures, the development of personalized federated models tailored to individual patient populations, and the extension of FL to a wider array of medical conditions. Additionally, addressing challenges related to model interpretability and managing client heterogeneity will be essential for broader implementation. This work lays the groundwork for the advancement of privacy- preserving AI solutions in healthcare, with profound implications for regulatory-compliant machine learning applications.

AB  - Actually, healthcare information can be really upgraded by the combination of blockchain technology with artificial intelligence. Reducing breach risks due to the decentralized and cryptographic protection of blockchain, it simply means that only authorized people would be able to access sensitive information, making the security of the data greatly improved. This also builds interoperability through standardizing protocols for exchanging data and using smart contracts as administered work, hence reducing chances of error and exertion on health care systems. AI contributes to real -time analytics by enabling predictive modeling and clinical decision support for healthcare experts to make informed, on-time decisions based upon a vast data set. The patient-controlled data features offered by Blockchain will empower the patients, bring in trust and transparency, and further ease healthier decisions due to real-time access to health records. It also helps much towards cost efficiency, considering that administrative costs are reduced with the automated process and further reduction of fraud through transparency offered by Blockchain. For instance, it creates clear audit trails for compliance with regulations like HIPAA, making compliance a much easier affair. Its architecture is cloud-based, allowing the system to scale to the demands that will arise from growing amounts of data. Case study and pilot program success stories have shown just how effective this combination of technology and healthcare services can be. This has become patently apparent in the joint proposals from the tech and healthcare companies. Looking ahead, IoT devices integrated with blockchain and AI might open new scopes for real-time health monitoring, whilst current research is working on the further improvement of algorithms and innovative scenarios. Overall, the integrated architecture would be opening a prospect for the new health care data management with improved results.

AB  - Parkinson’s Disease or PD is associated with a disabling, progressively motor function loss control which leads to Loss of Ambulation (LOA), which marks a critical and devastating development as patients lose independent mobility. Early detection of LOA is important in ensuring patient care and intervention. The traditional ways are often slow and imprecise. We suggest a Parkinson’s disease patient LOA prediction platform that combines cutting-edge neural networks utilizing machine learning techniques. Some of these machine learning techniques are Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest. The platform combines multiple sources of data from clinical assessments, motor function test results and wearable sensors to identify the more nuanced patterns relating to changes in motor function. Trained on an expansive dataset comprising longitudinal clinical observations and sensor readings in real time, the platform turns out to be far more predictive than conventional methods. The platform innovates existing frameworks and previous work by combining these methods to improve diagnostic accuracy, while preserving interpretability for deployment in healthcare settings with compliance of ethical standards. These advancements may ultimately result in the identification and treatment of Loss of Ambulation (LOA) in Parkinson’s Disease at a far earlier stage than previously possible, hence improving patient outcomes along with overall life quality.

AB  - Brain tumours rank as the fifth most common cancer type, affecting approximately 90,000 people annually and pose high risks due to their potential for life-threatening neurological impacts. Traditional diagnostic methods often lack visualization clarity, impeding accurate interpretation and delaying critical treatment decisions. To address these challenges, this study introduces a robust deep learning framework that combines ResNet101, InceptionV3, DenseNet201 and VGG16 architectures to classify brain tumours into four categories: pituitary, meningioma, glioma and no tumour. The model was trained and validated on a dataset of 7,022 MRI images and was finely tuned to maximize classification accuracy. Additionally, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was employed to generate interpretable heatmaps, highlighting key regions in MRI scans that influence classification.

AB  - Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) systems have brought transformative benefits to patient monitoring and remote diagnosis in healthcare. However, these systems are prone to various cyber attacks that have a high impact on security and privacy. Detecting such attacks is crucial for implementing timely and effective countermeasures. Machine learning methods have been applied for intrusion detection tasks in various networks, but explaining the reasons for detection decisions remains an obstacle for security analysts. In this paper, we demonstrate that Transformer architecture, the core of the recent revolutionary large language models, constitutes a promising solution for intrusion detection in IoMT networks. We utilized a comprehensive dataset, CICIoMT2024, recently released specifically for these networks. We created a binary classification model for discriminating attacks from benign traffic and a multi-class model for the identification of specific attack types. We applied Explainable AI (XAi) methods such as LIME and SHAP to generate posthoc explanations for the model decisions. We evaluated and compared the quality of explanations based on three metrics: faithfulness, sensitivity, and complexity. Our findings demonstrate that the applied XAI methods enhance transparency in the predictions of Transformer-based intrusion detection models for IoMT networks, proving that both transparency and high performance can be achieved simultaneously.

AB  - Humans' bad habits are a leading cause of many chronic illnesses. Preventative medicines and telemedicine courses for treating these conditions are proliferating. The availability of secure and pleasurable alternatives continues to be of paramount importance. When it comes to monitoring and studying human health, inertial measurement units (IMU) are frequently viewed as the most objective and least intrusive alternative due to their ability to identify motion patterns with relative ease. Machine learning is commonly regarded as an effective method for analysing IMU data and identifying motion patterns. As part of a smart healthcare learning tool, we describe a deep learning-based technique for detecting human movements. An innovative hybrid adjectives-based on before-classification & multi-features analysis technique is created to classify human motion for usage in healthcare e-learning. To begin, a Kalman filter is used to do preliminary processing on the raw data from the IMUs. An experiment is conducted in which minimum and average gravity reduction techniques are used to the acceleration data. Signal segmentation has been used to data from a variety of time periods to establish which kind of segmentation is most effective. Then, we identify active as well as passive motion patterns to do a preliminary categorization. Both static and dynamic motion patterns have been analysed to recover characteristics. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been used to categorise the active and passive motion components of healthcare e-learning. We accomplished this using the wearable computing and REALDISP datasets. In experimental comparisons, our proposed method for intelligent health care learning surpassed the current state-of-the-art systems. Implementing the technique as recommended led to an accuracy of 87.35% for the REALDISP dataset & 85.18 on the wearable computers dataset. Furthermore, a smart healthcare advisor is provided with access to the classified motion sequences in order to provide immediate feedback on human health.

AB  - Recently, thyroid disease has been a leading cause of mortality, underscoring the importance of early diagnosis to mitigate its impact. Researchers have randomly employed static selection ensemble methods aiming to forecast the disease in its initial stages. However, the use of such ensemble methods in healthcare diagnosis poses challenges related to performance consistency and potential mismatches with new data characteristics. Hence, this paper proposes a novel approach by introducing the Dynamic Selection Hybrid Model (DSHM) that leverages the most effective conventional classifiers using an appropriate ensemble method. Instead of going the conventional way, we evaluate various baseline classifiers to demonstrate their impact on the characteristics selected by two robust feature selection techniques. This evaluation employs an explainable AI (XAI) method, Permutation Feature Importance (PFI), and selects the most effective classifiers based on their characteristics impact. Then the selected classifiers are integrated by an appropriate ensemble method, based on a comparative evaluation between four efficient ensemble methods. Allowing the proposed DSHM to dynamically adjust its composition based on selecting conditions can potentially achieve robust performance by better adaptability on unseen data. Before the training DSHM, the methodology begins by addressing the dataset’s imbalance issue using an effective data balancing method BOO-ST. To demonstrate the superiority of DSHM, various performance evaluation matrices, and a statistical test are employed. The experimental results reveal the effectiveness of our proposed DSHM, outperformed with an impressive 99.33% accuracy. Finally, to enhance transparency, trust, and patient outcomes, we applied the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) to explain DSHM-provided outcomes. With a robust classification performance, our proposed DSHM aims to explain its outcomes, contributing to improved clinical decision-making processes and ultimately enhancing patient care.

AB  - Objective: To develop a clinical decision support tool that can predict cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk with high accuracy while requiring minimal clinical feature input, thus reducing the time and effort required by clinicians to manually enter data prior to obtaining patient risk assessment. Results: In this study, we propose a robust feature selection approach that identifies five key features strongly associated with CVD risk, which have been found to be consistent across various models. The machine learning model developed using this optimized feature set achieved state-of-the-art results, with an AUROC of 91.30%, sensitivity of 89.01%, and specificity of 85.39%. Furthermore, the insights obtained from explainable artificial intelligence techniques enable medical practitioners to offer personalized interventions by prioritizing patient-specific high-risk factors. Conclusion: Our work illustrates a robust approach to patient risk prediction which minimizes clinical feature requirements while also generating patient-specific insights to facilitate shared decision-making between clinicians and patients.

AB  - Integration of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) methodologies in the medical domain, as an application of healthcare, has seen unprecedented development in the past few years. The arrival of innovative CNN architectures in the field has provided domain experts with an additional diagnostic tool that increases their efficiency, along with providing distant healthcare support to remote regions to further develop a healthy and safe environment. Our work X-RetinaAI focuses on creating such an architecture that efficiently diagnoses patient retinal images, obtained through Optical Coherence Tomography, and classifies them into 4 different classes: Normal, Diabetic Retinopathy, Cataract, and Glaucoma, using pre-trained models such as VGG-16, and MobileNet, achieving a validation accuracy of 84.83% and 88.15% respectively. As a recent technological advancement, the Explainable Artificial Intelligence(X-AI) technique of Integrated Gradients is used to compute attribute scores and identify the features from the retinal images that have contributed most to the model's prediction. Further utilizing the features highlighted by the Integrated Gradients technique used in X-RetinaAI, a comparative analysis is performed to distinguish them from the meaningful features categorized by the ophthalmologists, so that the model can be re-trained while adding more weightage to these meaningful features, ensuring the robustness and reliability of the proposed model in classifying retinal diseases in the healthcare industry.

AB  - Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is a prevalent cardiac arrhythmia that carries an increased risk of stroke and heart failure. The manual interpretation of Electrocardiograms (ECGs) for diagnosing AF is time-consuming and subject to observer variability. Deep Learning (DL) techniques offer a promising solution for robust AF detection. This paper introduces a novel DL model that leverages ConvMixer and Transformer architecture, combining convolutional neural networks and attention mechanism to extract both local and global features from ECG data. It excels in accurately classifying ECG rhythms into two categories: normal and atrial fibrillation. Additionally, the model utilizes GradCAM++ visualization to provide interpretability. The model was evaluated using the PhysioNet/CinC 2017 Database, achieving accuracies of 91.66% on original data and 96.59% on preprocessed data. When applied to the the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database, it achieved accuracies of 95.86% on original data and 98.78% on preprocessed data, employing a ten-fold cross-validation strategy. This innovative approach has the potential to assist clinicians in the real-time detection of common atrial fibrillation during routine ECG screening, significantly enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of diagnosis. With a strong focus on improving patient outcomes and reducing the burden on healthcare professionals, this research represents a crucial step forward in cardiac arrhythmia detection.

AB  - Explainable AI must simultaneously help people understand the world, the AI, and when the AI is misaligned to the world. We propose situated interpretation and data (SID) as a design technique to satisfy these requirements. We trained two machine learning algorithms, one transparent and one opaque, to predict future patient events that would require an emergency response team (ERT) mobilization. An SID display combined the outputs of the two algorithms with patient data and custom annotations to implicitly convey the alignment of the transparent algorithm to the underlying data. SID displays were shown to 30 nurses with 10 actual patient cases. Nurses reported their concern level (1–10) and intended response (1–4) for each patient. For all cases where the algorithms predicted no ERT (correctly or incorrectly), nurses correctly differentiated ERT from non-ERT in both concern and response. For all cases where the algorithms predicted an ERT, nurses differentiated ERT from non-ERT in response, but not concern. Results also suggest that nurses’ reported urgency was unduly influenced by misleading algorithm guidance in cases where the algorithm overpredicted and underpredicted the future ERT. However, nurses reported concern that was as or more appropriate than the predictions in 8 of 10 cases and differentiated ERT from non-ERT cases better than both algorithms, even the more accurate opaque algorithm, when the two predictions conflicted. Therefore, SID appears a promising design technique to reduce, but not eliminate, the negative impacts of misleading opaque and transparent algorithms.

AB  - In the realm of machine learning, addressing class imbalance is a prevalent challenge, especially in datasets where certain classes are underrepresented. Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) emerges as a powerful solution, strategically generating synthetic instances for minority classes, thereby rebalancing the dataset. By carefully selecting parameters and employing appropriate evaluation metrics, SMOTE enhances the overall classification performance, ensuring accurate representation of minority classes essential for real-world applications. Bidirectional Feature Elimination (BiDFE) stands out as a sophisticated technique for this purpose. BiDFE iteratively identifies and retains the most relevant features pertinent to thyroid disease classification, striking a balance between adding informative features and removing redundant ones. This method enhances the interpretability and generalization of the model, ensuring its robustness and efficiency in handling thyroid disease data. The Proposed Model TDIP (Thyroid Disease Identification and Prediction), a novel hybrid approach integrating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. Leveraging LSTM's temporal learning capabilities and SVM's discriminative power, TDIP achieves an impressive accuracy of 97% in thyroid disease classification.

AB  - Ensemble learning becomes a backbone in disease diagnosis using several classifiers to ensure improved prediction accuracy and also model reliability. However, conventional ensemble techniques often suffer some critical challenges, like poor diversity among base models, less efficient convergence, and sometimes high computational costs. That is why addressing these matters is essential to make further strides in ensemble-based diagnostic frameworks. This study introduces the Adaptive Ensemble Optimization with Hybrid Learning (AE HL) as an Novel Bagging Approach with Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization (BA-TLBO). The AE-HL framework encompasses a new fitness function that uses a new diversity metric with the Hamming distance to optimize both accuracy and classifier diversity effectively. To counteract inefficiencies in convergence, AE-HL uses adaptive optimization strategy that learns to balance exploration and exploitation during the learning phase. A multi-phase An optimization technique is employed, that limits the amount of computation by successively refining the best promising configurations; dynamic bag size adaptations improve the trade-off between variance and bias and, hence generalization over different datasets. Furthermore, the approach is integrated with a lightweight Explainable AI (XAI) module in order to support interpretability without an increase in complexity. The method is tested on several benchmark datasets for disease diagnosis where it is shown that AE-HL outperformed best among several ensemble optimization techniques. In summary, the proposed method obtained the highest accuracy with explainability and diversity in comparison with advanced metrics and statistical analysis. These results confirm the robustness, efficiency, and transparency of the AE-HL as a solution for enhancing systems for disease diagnosis.

AB  - Affective computing has an unprecedented potential to change the way humans interact with technology. While the last decades have witnessed vast progress in the field, multimodal affective computing systems are generally black box by design. As affective systems start to be deployed in real-world scenarios, such as education or healthcare, a shift of focus toward improved transparency and interpretability is needed. In this context, how do we explain the output of affective computing models? and how to do so without limiting predictive performance? In this article, we review affective computing work from an explainable AI (XAI) perspective, collecting and synthesizing relevant papers into three major XAI approaches: premodel (applied before training), in-model (applied during training), and postmodel (applied after training). We present and discuss the most fundamental challenges in the field, namely, how to relate explanations back to multimodal and time-dependent data, how to integrate context and inductive biases into explanations using mechanisms such as attention, generative modeling, or graph-based methods, and how to capture intramodal and cross-modal interactions in post hoc explanations. While explainable affective computing is still nascent, existing methods are promising, contributing not only toward improved transparency but, in many cases, surpassing state-of-the-art results. Based on these findings, we explore directions for future research and discuss the importance of data-driven XAI and explanation goals, and explainee needs definition, as well as causability or the extent to which a given method leads to human understanding.

AB  - Asbestos remains a serious public health concern, particularly in older buildings, despite its ban in France in 1997. While both ontology and machine learning techniques have been used independently in various domains, their combination offers a novel approach for enhancing the detection and classification of asbestos-containing materials. This research introduces an innovative framework that integrates an ontology-based semantic model with decision tree algorithms and Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules to address the challenges of accurate asbestos identification. The use of ontology allows us to incorporate domain knowledge and semantic relationships, improving model interpretability and classification precision. In this study, we compared three approaches: a decision tree model without ontology, SWRL rules applied to a numerical ontology (where categorical variables were encoded), and SWRL rules applied to a categorical ontology (preserving the original categorical values). Our results show that the categorical ontology, when combined with SWRL rules, significantly outperforms the other models in classifying buildings as containing or not containing asbestos. However, we also observed that missing data in the dataset negatively impacts the performance of the ontology-based approach, highlighting the limitations of semantic models in data-incomplete environments. This work demonstrates the potential of combining ontology and machine learning to enhance asbestos detection while identifying the challenges that arise from incomplete data.

This study compares the effectiveness of four machine learning models—Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Deep Neural Networks (DNN)—in forecasting DVT risk. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset of patient demographics, clinical indicators, and imaging findings, we aimed to identify the most accurate predictive model. Our evaluation criteria included accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), with a dataset split of 70% for training and 30% for testing, supplemented by cross-validation to ensure reliability. The RF model demonstrated superior performance, achieving an accuracy of 92%, with exceptional sensitivity and specificity, underscoring its potential for clinical application. While the DNN showed promise in handling complex data interactions, its computational demand and data requirements limit its immediate utility. Conversely, LR and SVM offered a balance between interpretability, efficiency, and predictive power, making them viable for varied clinical scenarios. This research highlights the pivotal role of machine learning in enhancing DVT diagnostics within rehabilitation settings, suggesting a move towards integrating such models into clinical practice to improve patient care and outcomes. Further studies are encouraged to incorporate broader data types for enriched predictive accuracy.

AB  - Communicable diseases are transmitted through water, food, contaminated surfaces, bodily fluids, air. In such a situation, staying in home isolation for fewer chronic health problems and monitoring health status frequently through Medical Sensors (MSs) is recommended. The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in smart consumer electronics and sustainable healthcare has recently demonstrated remarkable results. However, the healthcare domain requires high levels of accountability and transparency for communicable disease prediction and sustainable life in edge networks. This paper aims to present an intelligent healthcare prototype that can identify risk factors according to monitoring parameters by analyzing the Explainable XGBoost (XXGB) model. Using edge networks for sustainable living, we explore the intersection between healthcare and consumer electronics. Initially, the prototype has been trained using the XXGB model over one publicly available dataset related to communicable diseases. Next, the prototype identifies patient risk factors by analyzing real-time monitoring parameters. Simulation results illustrate the efficiency of the proposed XXGB model up to 84.2% accuracy, which is higher than existing models.

AB  - Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a long-lasting and progressive brain disorder that disrupts the body’s nervous system pathways. This disruption leads to various issues with movement and control, leading to various symptoms, including tremors, stiffness, and difficulty with movement and coordination. In the early stages of this condition, the patients struggle to speak and also speak slowly. Dysphonia, a speech impairment or alteration in speech, is experienced by 70 to 90 percent of Parkinson’s patients and is an early indication of the disease. Hence, speech can be a vital modality for an early stage of PD diagnosis. In literature, various Machine Learning models are implemented for PD diagnosis based on speech data. However, issues like class imbalance, feature selection, and interpretable prediction analysis are not addressed effectively. Moreover, the accuracy and trustworthiness of the prediction results are essential for providing better healthcare services. Thus, we propose an Interpretable Feature Ranking XGBoost (IFRX) model that effectively addresses the above-mentioned issues. The proposed model has a sequence of processes, such as data preprocessing, class balancing, feature selection, classification, and eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). We trained the IFRX model based on speech data, which ranks the relevant features, builds an XGBoost classifier and ranked the features according to their relevance in diagnosing PD using Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Using the proposed model, we implemented eight Machine Learning classifiers for PD diagnosis based on speech data. Among these classifiers, the XGBoost approach shows better prediction performance with an accuracy of 96.61%.

AB  - Medicinal plants have been a cornerstone of healthcare practices globally, serving a significant population in developing countries who rely on affordable herbal remedies. However, the current marketing system through Mandis and wholesale markets suffers from opacity. Numerous intermediaries create an information gap for farmers regarding fair pricing and market trends. Additionally, concerns exist about misidentification and adulteration of medicinal plants due to limited knowledge among collectors and traders. The National Medicinal Plants Board (NMPB) recognizes the need for a robust supply chain. This paper proposes a blockchain-based platform ‘Indian Herbal Blockchain Network (IHBN)’ integrated with Deep Learning for image processing. The deep learning model has achieved a decent accuracy of 90.24% which decreases the chance of misidentification. The platform ensures transparent traceability of medicinal plants from source to consumer, along with accurate identification using image analysis. This system promotes transparency within the medicinal plant supply chain, reducing the risk of adulteration and improving overall trust.

AB  - Myocardial infarction (MI) boasts the highest mortality rate, striking suddenly and often stealthily. Conducting an electrocardiogram (ECG) examination stands as the most straightforward and rapid method to diagnose MI, rendering research into MI intelligent diagnosis via ECG of paramount importance. We developed a search and selection strategy to extract articles from Google Scholar and PubMed and analyzed the existing studies of MI intelligent diagnosis algorithms using ECGs according to three typical aspects: MI data enhancement, MI diagnosis models, and interpretability of models. First, techniques for enhancing MI data were summarized, and then, handcrafted features and models with automatic feature extraction were discussed. Meanwhile, the interpretability of MI diagnosis models was analyzed, including class activation mapping with gradient (Grad-CAM), Shapley additive explanations (SHAP), multihead attention mechanism, and knowledge graph. A comparative analysis encompassing the methodologies, datasets, the number of leads and input modalities, performance evaluation, as well as interpretability for MI diagnosis was given. We found that deep learning has achieved good performance and knowledge graph accomplished the best interpretability. Finally, limitations and challenges were pointed out, including lack of high-quality MI records, absence of dynamic ECG records, effective representations of different ECG morphologies, the promotion of models under inter-patient paradigm, the improvement of transparency and interpretability of MI diagnosis, and the high complexity of models. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive and multidimensional review analyzing intelligent diagnosis of MI using ECG signals.

AB  - Navigating the complex world of product ingredients can be a daunting task for health-conscious consumers. Often, ingredient labels are opaque and filled with jargon, hindering informed decision-making about product safety. This project addresses this challenge by developing a novel smartphone-based tool that leverages the power of image processing, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to empower consumers with accessible and transparent product safety assessments. The proposed tool harnesses smartphone cameras to capture ingredient lists. Image processing and OCR technologies extract the data, which is then analyzed by a Large Language Model (LLM) for comprehensive risk assessment. The LLM identifies potentially harmful components, and evaluates their interactions, generating a detailed and user-friendly safety report. The report offers clear explanations of risks, providing actionable insights for informed product choices. By providing an accessible and user-friendly tool, this project fosters transparency, trust, and responsible consumerism, ultimately safeguarding well-being through informed decision-making.

AB  - Several healthcare applications have been launched in recent years to enhance the healthcare sector. The emergence of miniature medical sensors to track patients’ vital signs has strengthened and enhanced the human healthcare system. The objective of this initiative is to improve healthcare security by integrating IoT and blockchain technology to preserve patient data and enable remote vital sign monitoring. Vital sign monitoring has been greatly enhanced by the widespread use of tiny medical sensors, which have increased data availability for early diagnosis and therapy recommendations. Nonetheless, there are issues with guaranteeing data security and privacy with the current technologies. Blockchain technology is included in the suggested solution because of its special qualities, which include transparency and data privacy. IoT sensors are used to gather patient data, like temperature, heart rate, and oxygen saturation levels, which are then safely sent via Postman API to a private permissioned blockchain. With a key size of 256 bits, the data is encrypted using SHA 256, creating public and private keys for further protection. Specialist physicians are able to read documents pertinent to their areas of expertise since access restriction is applied through private channels. In order to guarantee a strong and safe healthcare environment, the research also incorporates an easy-to-use interface for hospital managers to manage appointments, ambulance reservations, and get notifications when vital indicators surpass threshold levels.

AB  - Malaria, a fatal disease, is brought about when a female anopheles mosquito bites. Death may occur from malaria if treatment is not received in its early stages. It is highly important to identify the malaria parasite as early as possible in order to proceed with the appropriate treatment. Thus, the paper proposes a Lightweight CNN model that is designed to detect malaria parasite by early stage from microscopic blood images. To reveal the usefulness of the proposed model, Grad-CAM was applied to detect the image part of most concern (which pixels draw more attention from the model related with the other pixels) by generating heatmap image. The Model's efficiency is calculated by accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Comparative analyses are conducted against well-known transfer-learning (TL) models and state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, with the proposed method. The proposed model yielded 99.56% accuracy, 99.97% precision, 98.36% recall, 99% f1-score and 99.2% AUC score. As, the proposed CNN model is lightweight the prediction time for a single image is about 2 milliseconds which making it highly efficient for practical applications and have significant impacts on healthcare accessibility, efficiency and even cost savings in the resource limited settings.
