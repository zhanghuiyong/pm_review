AB  - The rise in heart-related diseases has driven the development of advanced techniques for identifying irregular heart conditions, and with the progress in artificial intelligence and signal processing, automated arrhythmia classification using machine learning and electrocardiograms (ECG) has become increasingly effective and widely utilized by healthcare professionals. This paper presents an efficient machine learning solution for robust arrhythmia classification using 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) by leveraging blending ensemble learning. Our developed blending model utilizing six base models-Adaptive boosting, Extreme gradient boosting, Decision trees, K-nearest neighbors, Random forest, and Support vector machine-with a Logistic regression meta-model, demonstrates enhanced efficiency in classifying arrhythmias based on 12-lead ECGs. This approach not only exploits the unique strengths of each base model but also captures diverse predictive patterns, which are combined by the LR meta-model into a refined and cohesive output. The use of LR as the meta-model enhances interpretability and generalization, reducing the risk of overfitting and optimizing overall performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed blending ensemble outperforms conventional notable works in terms of accuracy and offers a robust and effective solution for accurate arrhythmia classification, i.e. up to 97.2% accuracy, supporting clinical decision-making.

AB  - The integration of structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) and deep learning techniques is one of the important research directions for the automatic diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite the satisfactory performance achieved by existing voxel-based models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such models only handle AD-related brain atrophy at a single spatial scale and lack spatial localization of abnormal brain regions based on model interpretability. To address the above limitations, we propose a traceable interpretability model for AD recognition based on multi-patch attention (MAD-Former). MAD-Former consists of two parts: recognition and interpretability. In the recognition part, we design a 3D brain feature extraction network to extract local features, followed by constructing a dual-branch attention structure with different patch sizes to achieve global feature extraction, forming a multi-scale spatial feature extraction framework. Meanwhile, we propose an important attention similarity position loss function to assist in model decision-making. The interpretability part proposes a traceable method that can obtain a 3D ROI space through attention-based selection and receptive field tracing. This space encompasses key brain tissues that influence model decisions. Experimental results reveal the significant role of brain tissues such as the Fusiform Gyrus (FuG) in AD recognition. MAD-Former achieves outstanding performance in different tasks on ADNI and OASIS datasets, demonstrating reliable model interpretability.

AB  - Recently, there has been a surge in cyberattacks targeting the Internet of Health Things (IoHT), increasing the urgency for advancing network intrusion detection systems (IDS). Machine learning techniques, especially deep neural networks (DNNs), are demonstrating potential in improving the precision of detection methods. Despite their advantages, the complexity of DNNs can obscure their decision-making process, impacting their acceptance in security-critical environments. To improve the transparency of DNN models, we propose a novel post-hoc interpretation method that applies a perturbation-based approach with an optimized mask applied to an autoencoder model for IDS. More importantly, we leverage contrastive learning to maintain perturbed samples within the original feature space, reducing the risk of misclassification due to sample drift and ensuring a clear interpretation of the mask. We validate our approach using the NSL-KDD and UNSW15 datasets, showing that it provides clearer and more robust explanations compared to existing methods. This enhancement in interpretability is pivotal for healthcare cybersecurity experts to gain insights into the decision-making processes of black-box models.

AB  - The process of controlling the flow of products and services from a company by encompassing each stage involved in transforming raw materials and parts into finished items, also delivering them to the final consumer is known as Supply Chain Management (SCM). The development of numerous smart city applications including smart grids, smart homes, smart supply chains, and smart healthcare has drawn attention to the Internet of Things (IoT). Nowadays, researchers are considering the smart healthcare system’s role as a Public Emergency Service (PES) to treat patients promptly. A distributed smart fire brigade system receives little attention like PES to save lives and property from catastrophic fire damage. The conventional PES methods are created using a centralized method that needs a lot of processing power and doesn’t offer timely services. The traditional systems developed for managing the supply chain have drawbacks like single-point failure issues, data integrity, transparency, and lack of trust. To alleviate the existing issues, in this paper, a Blockchain and IoT Enable Secure and Transparent Supply Chain Management framework is utilized for PES in the smart city environment. Further, two edge computing servers, like a service controller and an IoT controller are adapted. The local storage is handled by the service and IoT controller. Thus, it enhances the data processing speed of PES requests and PES fulfillment. The service controller utilizes the Optimal Queue Model to manage the PES requests based on the minimum service queue length. The efficiency of the network is improved by fine-tuning the parameters from the Queue model with the aid of a Revised Fitness-based Political Optimizer (RF-PO). The multi-objective constraints like queue length, utilization, actual arrival time, expected arrival time, and end-to-end delay are utilized for the efficient supply chain system. These stimulated results show the feasibility and effectiveness of the supply chain framework.

This methodology combines the power of Information Gain (IG) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to identify and prioritize informative attributes while filtering out redundant and noisy data elements. Using the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository dataset, extensive experimentation demonstrates the superior performance of the FRFS system compared to baseline algorithms like Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree and Naive Bayes. The results reveal significant enhancements in runtime efficiency, cross-validation precision, and Area under the Curve (AUC) of the ROC. Moreover, the FRFS system enhances interpretability by highlighting key data patterns and feature importance, offering clinicians and researchers actionable insights for informed decision-making in lung cancer prediction. Thrureduction of the dimensions of the attributearea and selecting the most relevant attributes, the FRFS method streamlines the predictive modeling process and improves model generalization. This scalable and efficient solution holds promise in real-world clinical settings, where early detection is paramount for improving patient outcomes and facilitating timely intervention strategies in combating lung cancer. The findings underscore the potential of the proposed FRFS system as a valuable tool in the fight against lung cancer, providing a robust framework for integrating machine learning techniques into clinical practice. By harnessing the collective power of feature reduction and selection, this approach empowers healthcare professionals with actionable insights derived from complex medical datasets. Moving forward, extremeinvestigation and justificationanalyses are affirmed to evaluate the generalizing and scalabiling of the FRFS system across diverse patient populations and healthcare settings.

AB  - An adaptive interpretable ensemble model based on a 3-D convolutional neural network (3DCNN) and genetic algorithm (GA), i.e., 3DCNN+EL+GA, was proposed to differentiate the subjects with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and also identify the discriminative brain regions significantly contributing to the classifications in a data-driven way. The testing results on the datasets from both the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) indicated that 3DCNN+EL+GA outperformed other state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms. More importantly, in these identified brain regions, the discriminative brain subregions at a voxel level were further located with a gradient-based attribution method designed for CNN and illustrated intuitively. Besides these, the behavioral domains corresponding to every identified discriminative brain region (e.g., the rostral hippocampus) were analyzed. It was shown that the resultant behavioral domains were consistent with those brain functions (e.g., emotion) impaired early in the AD process. Further research is needed to examine the generalizability of the proposed ideas and methods in identifying discriminative brain regions and subregions for the diagnosis of other brain disorders (especially little-known ones), such as Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy, severe depression, autism, Huntington’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, using neuroimaging.

AB  - In the realm of precision medicine, the prediction of phenotypic traits from genotype data plays a pivotal role in understanding disease susceptibility, drug response, and overall health outcomes. Machine learning models trained on genotype data offer promising avenues for phenotype prediction. However, the black-box nature of these models often hinders interpretabil-ity, raising concerns about their reliability and trustworthiness in clinical decision-making. This paper explores the application of SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) on our existing CNN model to identify important features from genotype that contribute to phenotype prediction in yeast data. Both techniques on machine learning models include improving model transparency and interpretability by providing insights into prediction mechanisms. LIME focuses on local interpretability, explaining individual predictions tailored to specific instances swiftly, while SHAP computes feature importance using Shapley values, offering a comprehensive understanding of feature contributions. Our dataset contains 4,390 samples, each with 28,220 features in genotype which are used in the training, testing and validation of our existing CNN model. In our analysis of 20 phenotypes, we identify the number of relevant important features using SHAP, LIME methods, and the intersection which not only improves the Mean Squared Error (MSE) values compared to using all the features in the genotype data, but also the model training time.

AB  - Machine learning (ML) models have been used in functional neuroimaging for wide-ranging tasks, ranging from disease diagnosis to disease prognosis. There have been successive functional connectivity-based ML studies focused on improving model performances for disease detection. An increasing number of such studies use their trained models to detect and evaluate salient features that could be potential biomarkers of these neuro-logical conditions. The evaluation of these salient features is often qualitative and limited to cross-referencing existing literature for similar findings. In this study, we present objective quantitative metrics to evaluate the robustness of these salient features. Building upon existing generic evaluation metrics, we propose metrics that capture topological properties known to be characteristic of brain functional connectomes. Using existing and newly proposed measures on a set of baselines and state-of-the-art graph neural networks (GNN) models, we found that when GNNExplainer is used with models that incorporate attention, the scores produced are relatively more robust than other combinations. On datasets of patients with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) or Attention-deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), our proposed metrics highlighted that salient features identified in both disorders are highly involved in functional specialization, while salient ASD features expressed stronger functional integration than ADHD. We package these existing and novel metrics together in the RE-CONFIRM framework that holds promise to set the foundations for the quantitative evaluation of salient features detected by future studies.

AB  - For the public, understanding Large Language Models (LLMs) can be likened to recognizing how a well-trained assistant works—one that has read an extensive library of information on virtually every topic imaginable. Imagine an assistant that not only reads and remembers all this information but also learns the nuances of how words and ideas are connected across different contexts. This assistant can then use this knowledge to write articles, answer questions, compose emails, or even generate creative stories, all in a manner that feels surprisingly human. This capability comes from what's known as "transformer architecture," a type of design that helps the model pay attention to different parts of the text as it reads, making it adept at understanding and generating language. LLMs are a breakthrough in technology because they can understand and produce language with a level of subtlety and complexity that was previously unachievable, making them valuable tools across various industries. The paper aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the transformative impact of LLMs across various enterprise sectors. It intends to contribute to the understanding of how LLMs can enhance efficiency, innovation, and decision-making processes in industries such as healthcare, finance, education, and in the software engineering sector. It also provides a comprehensive overview of current popular LLMs in Enterprise applications, in various domains, and discusses the Ethical, Technical, and Regulatory challenges, future trends, and developments in this dynamic field.

AB  - Pediatric pneumonia remains a significant concern for public health, underscoring the need for efficient and precise diagnostic tools to enable timely intervention. In this research, we introduce a novel approach for detecting pediatric pneumonia in chest X-ray images. Our method leverages deep features extracted from DenseNet169, MobileNet, and EfficientNetB0 Neural Networks, which capture intricate patterns and textures indicative of pneumonia presence. These extracted features are then inputted into LightGBM, enabling effective learning of complex data patterns and relationships for classification purposes. We evaluated the effectiveness of our technique using a dataset comprising 5856 chest X-ray images from patients. Our approach achieved a remarkable accuracy of 96.16% with EfficientNet in binary classification (Pneumonia, Normal). Our method boasts several advantages, including robustness to variations in image quality, scalability, and interpretability. We evaluated our model's performance based on metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, precision, specificity, and F1- score, highlighting the potential of combining deep learning and gradient boosting techniques for pediatric pneumonia detection. This paves the way for improved clinical decision support systems in pediatric healthcare settings.

AB  - Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming industries by automating tasks such as text generation, data analysis, and customer interactions. Their impact spans various sectors, including finance, healthcare, legal services, and education’ where they streamline operations and enhance decision-making. Despite these advantages, the adoption of LLMs is hindered by challenges such as high computational costs, data privacy concerns, and the lack of explainability. Existing surveys on LLMs primarily focus on their capabilities and applications, emphasizing their role in generating human-like text, processing unstructured data, and supporting decision-making. However, these studies also highlight the significant limitations of LLMs, particularly around computational expense, privacy, and the “black box” nature of their outputs, which restrict their use in critical, regulated industries. This paper builds on prior work by exploring emerging solutions to address these challenges. It examines innovations such as domain-specific LLMs, LLM-as-a-Service (LLMaaS), and advancements in explainable AI (XAI) to enhance transparency and accessibility. The paper provides practical insights into how businesses can strategically adopt LLMs while mitigating risks, making them more viable for broader industry application.

Leveraging a subset of the SKaPa dataset, comprising 1,500 patients aged 30 to 70, and encompassing 14,870 tooth-wise event interval sequences, our method surpasses baseline models and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. By assessing temporal relations between event intervals and utilizing interpretable classification models such as decision trees (DTs) and random forests (RFs), our approach achieves higher recall rates and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) scores in identifying cases of caries development. Notably, our methods demonstrate superior performance in learning the minority class (i.e., caries development), underscoring the effectiveness of the event interval representation in capturing predictive features. These findings underscore the potential of our approach to improve caries prognosis and enable targeted interventions in dental healthcare.

AB  - Computer-aided diagnosis in healthcare involves collecting and modeling patients’ comprehensive health-related information from their Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Recently, the extensive acquisition of EHRs and scalable architectures of deep learning methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are generating robust healthcare assistance. Yet, the laborious pre-processing steps on EHR data and domain-specific feature engineering hinder the results of the model’s interpretability and transparency. Moreover, conducting obscure feature engineering tasks without domain knowledge may lead to the loss of relevant features, limiting the model’s ability to make reliable predictions. To alleviate these challenges, we proposes a method to represent the tabular EHR data in 2D images without leveraging any pre-processing or data cleaning tasks, which results in a generalized and more interpretable visualization of EHR tabular data. In addition, we evaluate the proposed method by predicting a cardiovascular disease, Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA), using pre-trained deep CNN models. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can perform highly in the SCA prediction without any missing value imputation and allow more transparency with less human expert intervention.

AB  - Parkinson’s disease (PD) results from the degeneration of nerve cells in the region of the brain that regulates movement. Common symptoms of this neurodegeneration include muscle stiffness, slowed movement, voice changes, coordination difficulties, and progressive disability. Early diagnosis is crucial for effective management and treatment of the disease. In this study, we propose a novel approach for diagnosing Parkinson’s disease using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). Our proposed method leverages KAN’s unique capabilities, which utilize learnable activation functions as weights on network edges to capture and model complex relationships within data. We compare the performance of the KAN model with that of traditional Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) in diagnosing PD. For both models, multiple architectures with varying configurations and random initializations were evaluated to ensure a fair and optimal comparison. Our results demonstrate that the KAN model not only achieves higher accuracy but also improves interpretability, highlighting its potential as a more effective tool for medical diagnosis. Specifically, the KAN model yielded an accuracy of $94.59 \%$, a precision of $93.94 \%$, a recall of $100 \%$, and an F1-score of 96.88%. In contrast, the best MLP model achieved an accuracy of $\mathbf{9 1. 8 9 \%}$, a precision of $\mathbf{9 3. 7 5 \%}$, a recall of $\mathbf{9 6. 7 7 \%}$, and an F1-score of 95.24%.

AB  - Estimating and monitoring the sleep states at home using ubiquitous infrared (IR) visual camera sensors is an essential healthcare problem. Currently, the common challenge of using IoT sensors to predict sleep stages is the “semantic gap” between the IoT sensory signals and the medical signals, where fewer correlations between IoT sensory signals and the sleep stage labels are observed. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel systematic and methodological IoT design (IoT-V2E) to retrieve the most similar electroencephalogram signal representations in a database given an IR visual query for sleep-related analysis. Specifically, we make the following specific contributions: 1) we collect a cross-modal retrieval data set, including the IR sensory signals and the synchronized Polysomnography signals with sleep stage ground-truth annotations; 2) we propose a novel uncertainty-aware hashing retrieval method, presenting superior performances, sufficient interpretability, and high memory efficiency; 3) our method achieves the state-of-the-art sleep stage retrieval results and provides the uncertainty for each query in the inference; and 4) most importantly, our system is evaluated to be able to assist the physicians not only in diagnosing sleep-related diseases but also finding the subjects with the most similar sleep patterns. Our project is available at https://github.com/SPIresearch/IoT-V2E.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease is a degenerative impairment that unhurriedly impairs remembrance, cognition, and behavior, ultimately leading to a loss of independence. This study focuses on detecting Alzheimer's across four categories, NonDementia, VeryMildDementia, MildDementia, and ModerateDementia that represent different levels of cognitive decline. Accurate early prediction is essential, as it enables timely intervention, which may help slow or even halt symptom progression, thereby improving patients' quality of life. Applying machine learning and deep learning in Alzheimer's detection presents a cost-effective solution, reducing the reliance on manual analysis and providing a scalable, efficient diagnostic tool. However, In prediction models, we still face a lack of interpretability, as healthcare providers must understand and trust the results. Previous research has utilized algorithms like Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors for Alzheimer's classification; nonetheless, these models often lack transparency. This research makes use of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative or ADNI dataset, applying EfficientNet for feature extraction owing to its superior precision and efficiency in computation. A Dense layers is used as the classifier, chosen for its seamless integration within the neural network framework and compatibility with interpretability methods. GradCAM++ is applied to enhance interpretability, highlighting specific brain regions that influence each decision. Through our design and applied methods, this research achieves a high classification accuracy of 97.84%, reflecting an improvement of nearly 2% over previous approaches. This approach shows promise in supporting healthcare professionals with early diagnosis and the planning of targeted interventions.

AB  - Nowadays, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a compound neurodevelopmental disorder that affects millions of persons universally, impacting their communication, communal interaction, and behavior. ASD is a diverse condition that exhibits differently in each individual, from trivial complications with social cues to severe challenges with parallel communication. ASD has become a demanding concern for healthcare professionals, and educationalists, highlighting the need for early detection, effective intervention, and wide-ranging support systems. As a result, an approach has proposed for predicting ASD at early stages, as the existing models have overfitting, class imbalance and more complexity problems. To overcome these issues a hybrid model of eXtreme Gradient Boosting and Logistic Regression (XGBoost-LR) has proposed, which involves with preprocessing of Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and Standard Scalar Standardization to balance class and to improve interpretability. Next, feature extraction is performed with Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and cross validation using 5foldCV to reduce overfitting and improve generalizability. The XGBoost-LR model gives a precise rate in predicting and classifying the stages of ASD. The proposed XGBoost-LR model gives the better results than the other existing methods Support Vector Machine (SVM) in terms of metrices accuracy, precision, recall, specificity and f1 score respectively.

AB  - Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and diabetes are the most prevalent NCDs, causing 1.9 and 1.5 million deaths yearly. Individuals diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (T1D) are at high risk of developing CVDs. Machine learning (ML) models have provided outstanding results in different domains, including healthcare, allowing to obtain models with high predictive performance. The aim of this study was to develop an interpretable data-driven approach to predict the 10-year CVD risk for T1D older individuals, aiming to provide both reasonable predictive performance and the identification of risk factors associated with CVDs. Data from T1D individuals at the Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen were used. Different ML-based models were considered, including KNN, decision tree, random forest, and multilayer perceptron (MLP). To enhance the predictive performance of ML models, the conditional tabular generative adversarial network (CTGAN) was used to create synthetic data and increase the size of the training data. Several filter and wrapper feature selection (FS) techniques were considered for identifying the most relevant features involved in CVD risk and enhancing the performance of the ML-based models used. To gain interpretability on predictive models, we used the post-hoc methods: SHAP and accumulated local effects. The experimental results showed a great performance of FS and ML-based models for predicting CVD risk. In particular, the MLP obtained the best results, with a mean absolute error of 0.0088 and mean relative absolute error of 0.0817. Regarding risk factors, age, Hba1c, and albuminuria were identified as crucial in CVD risk prediction, which is in line with recent clinical evidence. Our study contributes to identifying CVD risk and associated risk factors in a data-driven manner, helping to make early interventions and adequate treatments to prevent CVDs.

AB  - The Consensus Auditory-Perceptual Evaluation of Voice is a widely employed tool in clinical voice quality assessment that is significant for streaming communication among clinical professionals and benchmarking for the determination of further treatment. Currently, because the assessment relies on experienced clinicians, it tends to be inconsistent, and thus, difficult to standardize. To address this problem, we propose to leverage lightly weighted automatic audio parameter extraction, to increase the clinical relevance, reduce the complexity, and enhance the interpretability of voice quality assessment. The proposed method utilizes age, sex, and five audio parameters: jitter, absolute jitter, shimmer, harmonic-to-noise ratio (HNR), and zero crossing. A classical machine learning approach is employed. The result reveals that our approach performs similar to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, and outperforms the latent representation obtained by using popular audio pre-trained models. This approach provide insights into the feasibility of different feature extraction approaches for voice evaluation. Audio parameters such as jitter and the HNR are proven to be suitable for characterizing voice quality attributes, such as roughness and strain. Conversely, pre-trained models exhibit limitations in effectively addressing noise-related scorings. This study contributes toward more comprehensive and precise voice quality evaluations, achieved by a comprehensively exploring diverse assessment methodologies.

AB  - Summary <p>Industries play a vital role in the wealth of our nation. The growth of productivity of goods and services is directly related to the economy. Manpower, machinery, tools, and costs have drastically improved according to the developing technologies. The term Industry 5.0 refers to a scenario where people make use of advanced technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence, and smart machines for effective productivity. This development is more advantageous like providing low&#x2010;cost products, improved wages, and transportation of goods from rural to urban areas. Since industries are dependent on smart devices, and automated environments, energy consumption and data privacy have become a challenge nowadays. To resolve these issues, blockchain technology provides a decentralized network where the information and transactions are encrypted and stored as blocks. Each block undergoes data validation through the mining process and gets added to the chain of blocks as a blockchain. This is a distributed ledger where a copy of a transaction is distributed across the network to maintain data transparency and immutability. Supply chain management, digital twinning, and secure data exchange among the stakeholders are some of the applications of blockchain in Industries 5.0. This enhances traceability, transparency, and quality control in the supply chain because of its tamper&#x2010;proof property. Every transaction is securely recorded in the form of smart contracts which automate contracts that increase the efficiency of the system from malicious attacks. Digital twinning is another concept where a digital replica of the physical world is created and data are updated and synchronized accordingly. Thus, the implementation of blockchain technology in Industry 5.0 guarantees data security and privacy, which builds confidence among industrialists and increases efficiency.</p>

AB  - Machine learning (ML) models in healthcare are increasing but the lack of interpretability of these models results in them not being suitable for use in clinical practice. In the medical field, it is vital to clarify to clinicians and patients the rationale behind a model’s high probability prediction for a specific disease in an individual patient. This transparency fosters trust, facilitates informed decision-making, and empowers both clinicians and patients to understand the underlying factors driving the model’s output. This paper aims to incorporate explainability to ML models such as Random Forest (RF), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Multilyer Perceptron (MLP) for using with Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) data and interpret them in terms of feature importance to identify the top most features when distinguishing between lung cancer and non-lung cancer cases. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method has been used in this work to interpret the models. We use SHAP to gain insights into explaining individual predictions as well as interpreting them globally. The feature importance from SHAP is compared with the default feature importance of the models to identify any discrepancies between the results. Based on experimental findings, it has been found that the default feature importance from the tree-based models and SHAP is consistent with features ‘age’ and ‘smoking status’ which serve as the top features for predicting lung cancer among patients. Additionally, this work pinpoints that feature importance for a single patient may vary leading to a varied prediction depending on the employed model. Finally, the work concludes that individual-level explanation of feature importance is crucial in mission-critical applications like healthcare to better understand personal health and lifestyle factors in the early prediction of diseases that may lead to terminal illness.

AB  - The high death rate and rapid spread of pneumonia make it a serious global health concern. The precision of traditional diagnostic techniques is often compromised, particularly in resource-limited settings. Existing studies have predominantly focused on either binary or multi-class classification, often relying on limited datasets, which affects the generalizability and robustness of models. Additionally, the interpretability and transparency of deep learning models remain challenging in clinical environments. Addressing these challenges is crucial for advancing diagnostic methodologies to combat pneumonia. This study explores the use of transfer learning to improve the reliability of pneumonia classification using chest X-ray images. An automated classification system was developed, utilizing a combination of image preprocessing techniques, feature extraction with GLRLM, and various machine learning and transfer learning algorithms. Two datasets were employed: the GWCMCx dataset with 5856 chest X-rays and another dataset comprising 9207 chest X-rays. The system was designed for both binary and multi-class classification scenarios. CapsuleNet emerged as the most effective model, achieving an accuracy of ${9 9. 0 2 \%}$ in binary classification and $90.43 \%$ in multi-class classification, significantly outperforming previous studies. Additionally, a user-friendly web application was developed to facilitate the integration of the classification system into clinical workflows, accelerating clinical decision-making. This study demonstrates the potential of transfer learning to automate and improve pneumonia diagnosis, offering a scalable solution that can alleviate radiologists’ workload and improve patient outcomes.

AB  - Summary <p>This study delves into the transformative potential of blockchain technology in the medical domain. With paramount concern for patient data integrity, the blockchain emerges as a vanguard in safeguarding medical and insurance records from unwarranted third&#x2010;party interventions. The system, relying on e&#x2010;hash functions, provides robust end&#x2010;to&#x2010;end encryption, with each e&#x2010;hash being a composite of tailored smart contracts for discrete phases of medical record management. Central to this is a distributed ledger, accessible across nodes, ensuring data consistency and transparency. Whenever modifications occur in blocks or nodes, the entire system undergoes concurrent updates, allowing real&#x2010;time access for both the patient and their physician. Data retrieval mandates patient consent, emphasizing patient&#x2010;centered data sovereignty. A noteworthy parallel exists between the interconnected nature of web servers and the blockchain's structure. As proposed, e&#x2010;hash offers a compelling alternative to traditional record&#x2010;keeping. Furthermore, the blockchain's peer&#x2010;to&#x2010;peer architecture holds potential in revolutionizing broader aspects like drug traceability and supply chain management. This robust data repository stands to expedite medical research, offering researchers deeper insights into diseases and paving the way for innovative treatments. An intriguing future proposition emerges with the integration of blockchain with collaborative robots, potentially revolutionizing surgical procedures through automation.</p>

Providing real time health data, these sensors improve diagnostics and treatment outcomes. Security and privacy matters when IoT comes into play in healthcare. Cyberattacks on centralized database systems are also a problem. To solve these challenges, the study uses blockchain technology coupled with proxy re-encryption to secure health data. ThingSpeak IoT cloud analyzes the collected data and turns them into blockchain transactions which are safely kept on the DriveHQ cloud. Transparency and data integrity are ensured by blockchain, and secure data sharing among authorized users is made possible by proxy re-encryption. This results in a health monitoring system that preserves the accuracy and confidentiality of data while reducing the safety risks of IoT driven healthcare applications.

AB  - In the realm of data analysis, addressing missing data poses a critical challenge with implications for both research and practical applications. The absence of data points in datasets can significantly undermine the reliability and performance of predictive models, potentially leading to erroneous conclusions. This paper introduces a novel approach, Cluster-Centric Missing Value Imputation (CMI), designed specifically for imputing missing values in numerical features using clustering techniques. CMI is augmented by Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) values to interpret feature significance post-imputation. The core principle of CMI lies in recognizing that data points within the same cluster often share similar key attributes, enhancing the transparency and understandability of the imputation process. Experimental evaluation on two medical datasets, the Indian Liver Patient Dataset (ILPD) and Chronic Kidney Disease Data (CKD), demonstrates the superior performance and interpretability of CMI compared to traditional imputation methods such as mean imputation, k-nearest neighbors (KNN) imputation, and Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE). The findings suggest that CMI represents a significant advancement in data analysis, providing an effective and interpretable solution for handling missing data in healthcare research.

AB  - In the current landscape of machine learning, black-box models face certain limitations in applications such as healthcare and law due to their opacity. Consequently, there’s a growing preference for interpretable models to address these issues, with rule-based models being a significant category among them. Traditional rule-based models often rely on heuristic search techniques customized for particular rule-learning scenarios. These methods contrast sharply with the gradient-based approaches typical in neural machine learning. Recent efforts to bridge the gap between neural and symbolic machine learning have led to the exploration of gradient-based rule learning within neural network frameworks. These innovative approaches enable the application of neural network learning techniques to the realm of rule learning. In this work, we propose RB-Net, a neural network-based rule-generating interpretable model. We demonstrate its competitive performance in classification tasks compared to similar algorithms, particularly excelling when the number of rules is limited.

AB  - Laryngeal diseases diagnosis is a common challenge in medical image processing. Traditional methods usually use classification networks to process entire images or their cropped key area images. However, the former may not effectively focus on the crucial region within the image, while the latter is a two-stage task that cannot utilize global information. To address this problem, we propose a novel Data Closed-Loop Network (DCLNet) for laryngoscope image classification, fully utilizing the global features in the image and enabling end-to-end training. By introducing attention mechanisms, DCLNet can automatically expand the Laryngoscope 8 classification dataset into a high-quality annotated object detection dataset. Moreover, to address some inherent issues of medical datasets, such as poor interpretability and a long-tailed distribution, we employ the methods of data closed-loop and curriculum learning. In this way, performance on the baseline dataset can be improved by optimizing the annotation of the training set without changing the model structure. Extensive experiments prove that our model achieves better performance compared to existing traditional methods.

AB  - Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant attention due to their prospective applications in medicine. Utilizing multimodal LLMs can potentially assist clinicians in medical image classification tasks. It is important to evaluate the performance of LLMs in medical image processing to potentially improve the medical system. We evaluated two multimodal LLMs (LLaVA and GPT-4-based ChatGPT) against the classic VGG in tumor classification across brain MRI, breast ultrasound, and kidney CT datasets. Despite LLMs facing significant hallucination issue in medical imaging, prompt engineering markedly enhanced their performance. In comparison to the baseline method, GPT-4-based ChatGPT with prompt engineering achieves 98%, 112%, and 69% of the baseline's performance in terms of accuracy (or 99%, 107%, and 62 % in terms of F1-score) in those three datasets, respectively. However, privacy, bias, accountability, and transparency concerns necessitate caution. Our study underscore LLMs' potential in medical imaging but emphasize the need for thorough performance and safety evaluations for their practical application.

This can have amplifying consequences in the healthcare sector, image generation, and many others. Existing techniques to mitigate bias in AI primarily focus on data cleansing and model retraining, often proving ineffective due to the inherent complexity and hidden nature of biases. The main problem lies in the algorithm used for the cleaning of the data and not being effective enough to mitigate the bias present in the data. In contrast, the proposed approach is an architectural fusion of two of the algorithms for debiasing the data namely reweighing and adversarial debiasing. This architectural fusion promises significant advancements in transparent and unbiased chatbot interactions, compared to existing methods, it is going to pave the way for fairer and more equitable communication in the age of AI.

However, GRASP-FS may be time and resource-consuming for large datasets. In this work, we propose GRASPQ-FS, an extended version of GRASP-FS using Priority Queues to reduce resource consumption and processing time. As an additional contribution, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the most suitable parameters for our GRASPQ-FS. Our results reveal that GRASPQ-FS can speed up feature selection up to 90% over GRASP-FS, without compromising F1-Score. Also, we observed that a priority queue with 50 solutions saved 50% in execution time while increasing the F1-Score by 4.5%.

AB  - In recent years, continuous latent space (CLS) and discrete latent space (DLS) deep learning models have been proposed for medical image analysis for improved performance. However, these models encounter distinct challenges. CLS models capture intricate details but often lack interpretability in terms of structural representation and robustness due to their emphasis on low-level features. Conversely, DLS models offer interpretability, robustness, and the ability to capture coarse-grained information thanks to their structured latent space. However, DLS models have limited efficacy in capturing fine-grained details. To address the limitations of both DLS and CLS models, we propose SynergyNet, a novel bottleneck architecture designed to enhance existing encoder-decoder segmentation frameworks. SynergyNet seamlessly integrates discrete and continuous representations to harness complementary information and successfully preserves both fine and coarse-grained details in the learned representations. Our extensive experiment on multi-organ segmentation and cardiac datasets demonstrates that SynergyNet outperforms other state of the art methods including TransUNet: dice scores improving by 2.16%, and Hausdorff scores improving by 11.13%, respectively. When evaluating skin lesion and brain tumor segmentation datasets, we observe a remarkable improvement of 1.71% in Intersection-over-Union scores for skin lesion segmentation and of 8.58% for brain tumor segmentation. Our innovative approach paves the way for enhancing the overall performance and capabilities of deep learning models in the critical domain of medical image analysis.

AB  - People with diabetes must carefully monitor their blood glucose levels, especially after eating. Blood glucose management requires a proper combination of food intake and insulin boluses. Glucose prediction is vital to avoid dangerous post-meal complications in treating individuals with diabetes. Although traditional methods, and also artificial neural networks, have shown high accuracy rates, sometimes they are not suitable for developing personalised treatments by physicians due to their lack of interpretability. This study proposes a novel glucose prediction method emphasising interpretability: Interpretable Sparse Identification by Grammatical Evolution. Combined with a previous clustering stage, our approach provides finite difference equations to predict postprandial glucose levels up to two hours after meals. We divide the dataset into four-hour segments and perform clustering based on blood glucose values for the two-hour window before the meal. Prediction models are trained for each cluster for the two-hour windows after meals, allowing predictions in 15-minute steps, yielding up to eight predictions at different time horizons. Prediction safety was evaluated based on Parkes Error Grid regions. Our technique produces safe predictions through explainable expressions, avoiding zones D (0.2% average) and E (0%) and reducing predictions on zone C (6.2%). In addition, our proposal has slightly better accuracy than other techniques, including sparse identification of non-linear dynamics and artificial neural networks. The results demonstrate that our proposal provides interpretable solutions without sacrificing prediction accuracy, offering a promising approach to glucose prediction in diabetes management that balances accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency.

AB  - This study aims to explore the potential of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and explainable Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in predicting biomarker values associated with GDM when measured 13–16 weeks prior to diagnosis. We developed a system that forecasts biomarkers such as LDL, HDL, triglycerides, cholesterol, HbA1c, and results from the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) including fasting glucose, 1-hour, and 2-hour post-load glucose values. These biomarker values are predicted based on sensory measurements collected around week 12 of pregnancy, including continuous glucose levels, short physical movement recordings, and medical background information. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to forecast GDM-associated biomarker values 13 to 16 weeks prior to the GDM screening test, using continuous glucose monitoring devices, a wristband for activity detection, and medical background data. We applied machine learning models, specifically Decision Tree and Random Forest Regressors, along with Coupled-Matrix Tensor Factorisation (CMTF) and Elastic Net techniques, examining all possible combinations of these methods across different data modalities. The results demonstrated good performance for most biomarkers. On average, the models achieved Mean Squared Error (MSE) between 0.29 and 0.42 and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) between 0.23 and 0.45 for biomarkers like HDL, LDL, cholesterol, and HbA1c. For the OGTT glucose values, the average MSE ranged from 0.95 to 2.44, and the average MAE ranged from 0.72 to 0.91. Additionally, the utilisation of CMTF with Alternating Least Squares technique yielded slightly better results (0.16 MSE and 0.07 MAE on average) compared to the well-known Elastic Net feature selection technique. While our study was conducted with a limited cohort in South Africa, our findings offer promising indications regarding the potential for predicting biomarker values in pregnant women through the integration of wearable devices and medical background data in the analysis. Nevertheless, further validation on a larger, more diverse cohort is imperative to substantiate these encouraging results.

AB  - Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in classification and regression tasks on RGB-based pathological inputs. The network’s prediction mechanism must be interpretable to establish trust in the clinical routine. One principal approach to interpretation is feature attribution. Feature attribution methods identify the importance of input features for the output prediction. Building on the Information Bottleneck Attribution (IBA) method, we recognize the RGB’s input regions with high mutual information with the network’s output for each prediction. IBA identifies input regions that have sufficient predictive information. In this paper, we introduce "IBATree", a novel approach that combines IBA with decision trees to enhance both the interpretability and accuracy of DNNs in cancer cell classification. Our method leverages the information bottleneck framework to inject noise into feature maps and then isolates the most informative features for model predictions while maintaining high classification performance. We evaluated our proposed approach on three datasets—CNMC, ISBI2016, and BreaKHis—demonstrating competitive accuracy and producing clear interpretations. This makes IBATree particularly suitable for clinical applications, where understanding the rationale behind predictions is crucial. Our results show that IBATree provides reliable predictions and valuable insights into feature importance, paving the way for its application in various biomedical domains.

AB  - The integration of visual and textual data in medical diagnostics holds significant potential for improving the accuracy and reliability of clinical decision-making. Classical algorithms like CLIP, ConVIRT, and MedCLIP have made strides in this direction by leveraging multimodal data, but they face several challenges. These include the need for extensive labeled training data, difficulties in accurately aligning multimodal information, limited model interpretability, and ensuring robustness across diverse clinical settings. In response to these issues, we introduce BoneCLIP-XGBoost, a novel diagnostic model that combines the strengths of Vision Transformer (ViT) and ClinicalBERT for feature extraction with the powerful classification capabilities of XGBoost. By encoding X-ray images and textual descriptions into a unified feature space, BoneCLIP-XGBoost achieves superior alignment and integration of multimodal data. Our ablation study highlights the model’s exceptional performance, demonstrating an accuracy of 88.5%, precision of 87.3%, recall of 86.8%, and an F1 score of 87.0% when both image and text data are utilized. These results underscore the effectiveness of our approach in addressing the limitations of existing methods, providing a more accurate and reliable solution for medical diagnostics.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, such as federated learning (FL), have been employed in Internet of Things (IoT) networks to harness the enormous amounts of data generated by ubiquitous IoT devices. However, using FL technique in IoT networks brings new security and privacy challenges like model inversion, data poisoning, and central aggregation failure. In this paper, we introduce an innovative framework that integrates blockchain technology and secure multi-party computation (MPC) with FL in IoT networks to address these challenges. Our proposed system enables decentralized and privacy-preserving FL across distributed IoT environments. Utilizing MPC protocols, our framework securely aggregates model updates from clients without revealing individual data, while blockchain technology ensures transparency and immutability of transactions. Security analysis shows that our framework can effectively address the three aforementioned security and privacy challenges and improve the reliability and robustness of FL processes in IoT networks. Our framework can be adapted and integrated with real-world AI-augmented IoT networks, such as smart cities and healthcare, to enhance their protection of security and privacy.

This paper proposes ConPrO: a novel representation learning method for severity assessment in medical images using Contrastive learning-integrated Preference Optimization. Different from conventional contrastive learning methods that maximize the distance between classes, ConPrO injects into the latent vector the distance preference knowledge between various severity classes and the normal class. We systematically examine the key components of our framework to illuminate how contrastive prediction tasks acquire valuable representations. We show that our representation learning framework offers valuable severity ordering in the feature space while outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods on classification tasks. We achieve a 6% and 20% relative improvement compared to a supervised and a self-supervised baseline, respectively. In addition, we derived discussions on severity indicators and related applications of preference comparison in the medical domain.

AB  - Competing risks in survival analysis pose a significant challenge in healthcare, but few methods effectively address this problem. Moreover, the use of deep learning techniques remains limited, with the most prevalent approach, DeepHit, being non-parametric. This often leads to limitations in inter-pretability and statistical inference, which are crucial aspects. We propose a new alternative that harnesses the power of variational autoencoders and deep learning to tackle survival analysis with competing risks within a parametric framework. Our model, CR-SAVAE, allows direct interpretation of covariate effects on survival outcomes and enables researchers to perform robust statistical analysis compared to non-parametric approaches, essential for understanding risk mechanisms and making informed clinical decisions. It provides personalized medicine insight by accurately estimating the cumulative incidence function and avoiding the need for proportional hazards assumptions inherent in other models. Through comprehensive experiments on datasets with varying degrees of censoring and competing risks, we demonstrate the potential of our approach to achieve performance comparable to that of DeepHit based on the concordance index and integrated Brier score. This study highlights the potential of CR-SAVAE to advance survival analysis, improve interpretability, and enable more accurate and personalized clinical decision making in healthcare settings.

AB  - In the field of chest X-ray (CXR) diagnosis, existing works often focus solely on determining where a radiologist looks, typically through tasks such as detection, segmentation, or classification. However, these approaches are often designed as black-box models, lacking interpretability. In this paper, we introduce Interpretable Artificial Intelligence (I-AI) a novel and unified controllable interpretable pipeline for decoding the intense focus of radiologists in CXR diagnosis. Our I-AI addresses three key questions: where a radiologist looks, how long they focus on specific areas, and what findings they diagnose. By capturing the intensity of the radiologist’s gaze, we provide a unified solution that offers insights into the cognitive process underlying radiological interpretation. Unlike current methods that rely on black-box machine learning models, which can be prone to extracting erroneous information from the entire input image during the diagnosis process, we tackle this issue by effectively masking out irrelevant information. Our proposed I-AI leverages a vision-language model, allowing for precise control over the interpretation process while ensuring the exclusion of irrelevant features.To train our I-AI model, we utilize an eye gaze dataset to extract anatomical gaze information and generate ground truth heatmaps. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method. We showcase that the attention heatmaps, designed to mimic radiologists’ focus, encode sufficient and relevant information, enabling accurate classification tasks using only a portion of CXR. The code, checkpoints, and data are at https://github.com/UARK-AICV/IAI.

AB  - Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder that presents significant diagnostic challenges due to its complex neurophysiological characteristics. This paper investigates the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI’s GPT-4 and GPT-o1, in detecting schizophrenia through electroencephalography (EEG) analysis. Using the LMSU public ScZ EEG dataset, we conducted a series of experiments involving different types of input data, including raw EEG signals, frequency band summaries, and graphical representations of brain activity. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can accurately classify schizophrenic and healthy individuals while offering interpretable, clinically relevant insights aligned with established EEG markers. By integrating these models into the diagnostic workflow, we explore the concept of Symbiotic AI, where LLMs act as cognitive collaborators, enhancing clinicians’ ability to analyze complex data efficiently and transparently. This approach not only improves diagnostic accuracy but also facilitates real-time decision-making, paving the way for earlier and more precise detection of schizophrenia in clinical settings.

AB  - Wrist-worn wearable devices have become increasingly prevalent in monitoring human activities, with applications ranging from healthcare to fitness tracking. Accurate human activity recognition from wrist-worn sensor data is essential for enabling these applications. However, the high-dimensional nature of sensor data poses challenges in terms of computational complexity and model interpretability. Feature selection is a critical step in mitigating these challenges by identifying a subset of relevant features while preserving the discriminative information. In this study, we propose a complexity-aware feature selection method tailored for wearable systems. Our approach leverages the intrinsic characteristics of the data to prioritize and select the most informative features while simultaneously weighing their computational efficiency by means of an ad-hoc metric that quantifies the number of significant CPU instructions associated with each feature. The results on publicly available datasets demonstrate that the proposed method effectively balances computational complexity and recognition accuracy.

AB  - This research relies on a feature selection method termed LasNO to analyse the progress of diabetes prediction. The ANOVA integrated with Lasso regularization identifies significant predictors like Age, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, and (Glucose). An AdaBoost model with the following characteristics was developed, and the results were exceptional performance metrics: 97.02% accuracy, 87.65% precision, and 82.5% recall. The results of the primary focus on glucose levels to differentiate between events with and without diabetes have been affirmed from the visual analyses. It also calls into attention that due to the appropriate cross-validation, LasNO is very successful on improving the interpretability and the possibility of generalization of the model. Such findings make it clear that efforts towards early detection of the condition and subsequent timely implementation of measures to contain the illness can go quite a long way in enhancing the quality of the lives of people that contract the disease. Further research is likely to be devoted to the assessing of the improved and broadened validation of the dataset as a critical approach for the enhancement and expansion of the model for use in clinics. As a result, this study aims to advance diabetes theragnostic possibilities and healthcare recommendations for better action based on ML approaches enhancing the accuracy of predictions. In this study, approaches to feature selection used for improving the performance while also making the models more understandable are the focus. The idea is to ensure that medical practitioners have reliable tools to undertake early detection and management of diabetes. Thus, the main objective of dealing with patients’ Health-Related Quality of Life is to simultaneously increase the quality of patients’ living while decreasing the costs of their treatment.

AB  - Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) poses a substantial healthcare challenge marked by cognitive decline and a lack of definitive treatments. As the global population ages, the prevalence of AD escalates, underscoring the need for more advanced diagnostic techniques. Current single-modality methods have limitations, emphasizing the critical need for early detection and precise diagnosis to facilitate timely interventions and the development of effective therapies. We propose a novel multimodal medical diagnostic framework for AD employing a hybrid deep learning model. This framework integrates a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract detailed intra-slice features from MRI volumes and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture intricate inter-sequence patterns indicative of AD progression. By leveraging longitudinal MRI data alongside spatial, temporal, biomarkers, and cognitive scores, our framework significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy, particularly in the early stages of the disease. We incorporate Grad-CAM to enhance the interpretability of MRI-based diagnoses by highlighting relevant brain regions. This multimodal approach achieves a promising accuracy of 92.65%, outperforming state-of-the-art works by a margin of 6%.

AB  - Coughing is one of the most common symptoms of respiratory disorders, and variations in the cough sound relate to factors such as the type and quantity of secretions, physiological differences in the airway, and the force of the expulsion of the air. Automated analysis of spontaneous cough sounds in a smart home can provide a non-contact, non-invasive method to identify changes in health status, and passively monitor the progress of conditions such as chronic lung disease, to support independence and aging in place. In this work we propose analyzing and characterizing coughs using vocal tract models originally developed for speech coding. These models can relate cough sounds to physiological features, helping provide the interpretable and explainable predictions that are necessary for trust and confidence in healthcare applications. We show that linear prediction can effectively capture the time and frequency dynamics of different cough phases. We also demonstrate the interpretability of the model parameters by developing features to distinguish wet and dry cough sounds. The features achieve perfect linear separation of coughs in a small physician-labelled dataset and provide insight into the sound characteristics that contribute to those descriptors. The compact representation of cough sounds provided by the parametric model approach motivates further investigation for embedded cough analysis applications.

AB  - The emergence of modern artificial intelligence has been integral to many applications in healthcare and gait analysis has been no exception to this. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive approach to gait analysis that leverages sophisticated computer vision techniques and deep learning models. Foremost we have used high-resolution human pose detection model, SimpleHRNet to obtain fine-grained body k eypoints in real-time and also for uploaded videos frame by frame. We then extract gait parameters, stride length in particular, from the spatial dependencies of relevant joints in order to obtain critical insight into human locomotion dynamics. Next, we have enhanced LSTM model to detect abnormal gait by learning temporal patterns from the assembled dataset. We evaluate our approach using quantitative metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and qualitative visualizations suggesting that the proposed approach can accurately predict gait abnormalities. Post-processing steps refine t he data for improved interpretability, contributing t o a holistic understanding of the model's performance. The study emphasizes ethical considerations, responsible AI practices, and potential applications in healthcare and biomechanics. The results offer a nuanced analysis of gait patterns, fostering a deeper comprehension of human movement through the synergy of state-of-the-art technology and biomechanical insights.

AB  - Survival models based on whole slide images (WSIs) are widely used in precision medicine to treat cancer patients better. Most previous studies attempted to address the challenge of WSIs' gigapixel resolutions to survival models, but they failed in terms of computational efficiency and interpretability of models. This study proposes a coarse-to-fine survival model called WSISur based on graph neural networks, which not only solves the above two problems but also achieves the best survival prediction performance. To solve the issue of computational efficiency, coarse WSI graphs are first constructed on low-resolution images in WSIs, and then fine WSI graphs are built with high-resolution images on the basis of coarse WSI graphs. Subsequent survival analysis is performed on the constructed WSI graphs. To solve the issue of interpretability of the model, WSIs' regions most relevant to patients' lifetimes are identified by gradient-weighted class activation mapping. Nevertheless, due to the imbalance of data labels, there is a problem of probability failure in end-to-end mini-batch training. To this end, a survival event sampling strategy is proposed to balance data labels. In addition, a series of experiments are carried out on multicenter datasets to evaluate the proposed model. Experimental results show that WSISur achieves the state-of-the-art result compared with other existing related methods, and has stronger domain invariance. Results also demonstrate the interpretability of WSISur.

AB  - Electronic Health Records, which contain abundant structured data information of the patients, can help clinicians and data scientists address complex medical issues, particularly medication recommendation. The recommendation of medications is crucial for accurate and timely prescriptions. It is a nuanced task that entails analyzing various sources of healthcare data. Traditional medication recommendation is performed manually, which is labor-intensive and error-prone. The development of Electronic Health Records enables automatic medication recommendation. There are mainly two categories of methods for automatic medication recommendation. The first category uses the patients' current visit information and the drug-drug interactions (DDI). For these methods, both the comprehensive patient's medical history and the significant medication-diagnosis knowledge are not exploited appropriately. The second category utilizes longitudinal patient data, but different history visits are incorporated indiscriminately. Furthermore, in clinical practice, the associations between historical medications and future prescriptions are highlighted. However, they are less emphasized in current methods. Nevertheless, this is less emphasized by current automatic medication recommendation methods. To tackle the above challenges, we propose a three-module Discharge Medication Recommendation Network, called DMRNet, for accurate discharge medication recommendations. Specifically, the Information Integration Module combines information from the current visit and significant external knowledge e.g., the Diagnosis-Medication Co-occurrence (DMC) relationship. The Medication Retention Module is specially designed to capture the associations between the historical medications and the recommended medications. The History Retrieval Module differentiates the significance of different historical visits and incorporates them based on different significance values. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets, i.e., MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV, confirm DMRNet's superiority over state-of-the-art baseline methods in terms of Jaccard Similarity, F1-score, Precision and Recall.

AB  - The challenge of interpretability remains a significant barrier to adopting deep neural networks in healthcare domains. Although tree regularization aims to align a deep neural network’s decisions with a single axis-aligned decision tree, however, relying on one tree for all inputs often leads to sub-optimal performance and interoperability. To address this limitation, we propose an enhanced tree regularization method that integrates a post-hoc visual explainable model such as Grad-CAM. This approach guides the deep model to be well-approximated by decision trees tailored to the salient regions identified by Grad-CAM in the input space. We rigorously validate the effectiveness of this framework on two cancer cell datasets: CNMC, which focuses on acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells, and ISBI2016, which comprises benign and malignant skin lesions. The results demonstrate that the proposed method delivers simpler and more interpretable explanations without compromising accuracy, thereby advancing the interpretability of deep learning models in critical healthcare applications.

AB  - Deep neural networks have made remarkable contributions in many fields such as computer vision and natural language processing. However, due to their complex internal structures, for a long time, there is a lack of trust in deep neural networks, particularly in the domains like healthcare, finance, traffic safety, etc. To explain the internal mechanism of deep neural networks, a series of interpretable models, which mainly focus on enhancing the interpretability of deep learning models, has been proposed. This study pursues to data interpretability by analyzing the significance of image features with the goal of mining essential information contained in various visual features. Super-pixel segmentation is firstly applied to divide the image into several coherent visual feature regions, and these regions are subsequently overwritten by certain marks. Next, image occlusion is realized by modifying the pixel values of these feature regions according to the marks. Finally, we conduct comparative analytics of the classification results between the original data and occluded data to scrutinize the importance of key visual features. A collection of experimental studies is conducted and the results consistently demonstrate that the proposed method enables to observe the classifier’s dependence on different features, offering a new perspective on interpretability rooted in data analytics.

AB  - Attributed networks are prevalent in the current information infrastructure, where node attributes enhance knowledge discovery. Anomaly detection in attributed networks is gaining attention for its potential uses in cybersecurity, finance, and healthcare. Recognizing the complicated relationship between node attributes and network topology is crucial for attributed network embedding and anomaly detection. Nevertheless, there are few approaches available to directly represent the relationship between these two perspectives of the node property and the network topology. Approaches utilizing the reconstruction error rely on straightforward, simple mappings, which introduce a substantial risk of overfitting in high-dimensional data, wherein the model acquires patterns that are exclusive to the training data and fails to generalize to new data. To do this, we suggest a new way to find graph anomalies on attributed networks using random masking and padding along with sparse canonical correlation analysis. Motivated by the limitations of existing methodologies in effectively addressing these challenges, our research introduces a novel methodology for anomaly detection in attributed networks by leveraging Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis (SCCA) in conjunction with Random Masking and Padding (RMP). This dual approach uniquely addresses the challenges of high-dimensional data and the sparsity of attributes, which are prevalent issues in anomaly detection. Unlike previous works that primarily focus on either dimensionality reduction or attribute sparsity independently, our method synergizes these aspects to enhance detection performance. Initially, we randomly mask and pad nodes in the attributed network and use the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to map them to latent space. Next, we optimize the distribution alignment of node attributes and graph structure latent space representations by using Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence regularization, which increases their comparability. Finally, we use sparse canonical correlation analysis (SCCA) to quantify the correlation between node attributes and network structure views in latent space. SCCA incorporates sparsity by making the model choose fewer variables, which adds another level of complexity. It improves interpretability and reduces overfitting in high-dimensional data analysis by highlighting only the key variables. To optimize our model, we maximize the correlation between attribute and structural aspects of normal nodes, and anomalies are detected by measuring the correlation between these two views. Our approach is the first of its kind to provide a novel remedy to the fundamental problems preventing efficient and accurate anomaly identification, thereby establishing a new standard in this field. The proposed model has been extensively tested on four real-world datasets, and its effectiveness has been demonstrated in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches. The empirical evaluation across multiple benchmark datasets validates the potential of the proposed approach as a pivotal tool in advancing anomaly detection research and applications.

AB  - Cervical cancer, which is ranked fourth among cancers affecting women, is highly treatable when detected early through the pap smear test. Deep Learning (DL) models, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), analyze pap smear images, yet their "Black-Box" nature raises transparency concerns in medical diagnostics. This paper introduces a solution named EnsembleCAM to enhance interpretability by unifying visual explanations through the combination of diverse Class Activation Maps (CAMs). Using the Herlev Dataset, we employ data pre-processing, data augmentation techniques, develop an XceptionNet based binary classification model with an accuracy of 89% and apply GradCAM, GradCAM++, Score-CAM, Eigen-CAM and LayerCAM on this classifier. Then, the novel EnsembleCAM is constructed taking the median of activation maps from the five individual CAM methods. The analysis of activation maps of each CAM method and EnsembleCAM confirmed that in activation maps of EnsembleCAM, higher activation values were more concentrated around the nucleus which is the most important region in indicating cervical malignancy. The evaluation using pixel flipping performance metric also proved that the EnsembleCAM effectively recognises regions vital to the model's decision-making through its steepest drop in the mean prediction score when the pixels in the region contributing most to the model's decision were flipped.

AB  - Causal inference and model interpretability are gaining increasing attention, particularly in the biomedical domain. Despite recent advance, decorrelating features in nonlinear environments with human-interpretable representations remains underexplored. In this study, we introduce a novel method called causal rule generation with target trial emulation framework (CRT RE), which applies randomize trial design principles to estimate the causal effect of association rules. We then incorporate such association rules for the downstream applications such as prediction of disease onsets. Extensive experiments on six healthcare datasets, including synthetic data, real-world disease collections, and MIMIC-III/IV, demonstrate the model’s superior performance. Specifically, our method achieved a β error of 0.907, outperforming DWR (1.024) and SVM (1.141). On real-world datasets, our model achieved accuracies of 0.789, 0.920, and 0.300 for Esophageal Cancer, Heart Disease, and Cauda Equina Syndrome prediction task, respectively, consistently surpassing baseline models. On the ICD code prediction tasks, it achieved AUC Macro scores of 92.8 on MIMIC-III and 96.7 on MIMIC-IV, outperforming the state-of-the-art models KEPT and MSMN. Expert evaluations further validate the model’s effectiveness, causality, and interpretability.

AB  - Electronic voting has seen persistent security and privacy issues preventing its widespread adoption and success. This research introduces a robust framework that leverages advanced hashing, encryption techniques with blockchain technology which enhance the security of voting transaction and authenticity of voter data. India, which is world's largest democracy, faces electoral challenges such as fake voting and tampering with Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs). Addressing these issues biometric-based voting system that verifies voter identity through fingerprint authentication is the suggested.

AB  - Action recognition plays an important role in promoting various applications in healthcare and smart education. However, unclear target actions, similar actions, and occluded characters may be encountered in some special scenarios. To solve the issues, a 3D Graph Convolutional Feature Selection and Dense Pre-estimation for Skeleton Action Recognition (3D-GSD) method is proposed to analyze and recognize the motion trajectory of the human skeleton. First, 3DSKNet is designed to adaptively learn and select important features in the skeleton sequence to identify skeleton parts of different importance more accurately according to the size of the input image resolution. It will help to better focus on key skeletal parts, improving the accuracy and robustness of bone recognition. Then, the DensePose algorithm is used to detect the complex key points of the human body posture and optimize the accuracy and interpretability of action recognition for different key points, key channels, and key-frames of the action. The proposed method achieves the best performance on the NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120 datasets, and Kinetics SKeletion 400 datasets, with an improvement of 0.02% 0.06%, and 0.1% in accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - In the era of Industrial 5.0, privacy protection in mobile crowdsensing (MCS) becomes even more important to achieve the goals of being human-centric, resilient, and sustainable. To address privacy challenges in MCS environments, this paper first conducts a systematic literature review to identify the research gap in MCS privacy protection and classify privacy protection strategies in terms of key phases of a MCS process. Then a six-dimensional framework for MCS privacy protection integrating user perspective, interaction perspective, and system security perspective is proposed. This comprehensive framework addresses the multifaceted privacy protection limitations identified in MCS process by examining the intersections between these dimensions. Then its effectiveness is demonstrated by case study ‘MCS for personalized healthcare’. This framework balances privacy and data utility, empowers users with transparent policies and control interfaces, and employs AI-driven adaptive security measures. Additionally, it provides a research roadmap for sustainable and resilient privacy protection in the context of Industrial 5.0, offering a comprehensive and user-centric solution to evolving privacy challenges.

AB  - In recent years, speech as an easily accessible biomarker, has gained significant attention due to its numerous advantages and is currently a focus of active research and development in healthcare and medical fields. Due to the advancements in signal processing and deep learning technology, many studies have reported the effectiveness of using speech to detect clinical depression. However, these studies lack clinical interpretability, hindering the linkage of acoustic features to disease biology and reducing their utility for clinicians and patients. In this study, we proposed two explainable features common temporal pattern (CTP) and multi-frequency band Hurst (MFB-Hurst). These features are designed to measure clinically common symptoms of depression in speech, specifically reduced speech inflection, and noise during vocal tract closure in speech production. Based on the pronunciation data of 10 phrases, including sus-tained vowels and common expressions from healthy individuals and patients, CTP and MFB-Hurst achieved 70% and 64% accuracy in depression detection, respectively. The combination of CTP and MFB-Hurst achieved an average accuracy of 72%. These results demonstrate the potential of the proposed features in depression detection. Moreover, since these inter-pretable features are derived from clinical experience, they facilitate future applications in clinical settings.

AB  - The identification of osseous fractures has significant importance for defining precise medical diagnosis and con- structing treatment plans, especially in emergent and orthopedic contexts. This work proposes a new classification framework for different types of hand fractures through the integration of the EfficientNet-B3 deep learning model with an SVM classifying kernel. The feature extractor uses the pre-trained and then fine-tuned EfficientNet-B3 model on hand X-ray images to obtain both higher level and fine-grained features required to accurately detect the fractures. Subsequent features are then again passed to an SVM classifier which defines an ideal decision boundary mapping which increases the model’s accuracy and interpretability. The dataset utilized in this study consists of 1,000 hand X-ray images obtained from different medical centers, which went through different preprocessing to enhance the image quality, as outlined below: Conversion of the images to grayscale benzylpenicilloyl hydrochloride—Gaussian blurring of the images, and edge detection on the images. In assessing the efficacy of the model, a variety of evaluative metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and additional analytical tools, were employed, with the accuracy percentage reaching an impressive 93.5 percent in classification. A comparison of the proposed model using existing approaches is promising when it comes to the adaption of the data set into an automated system with a highly accurate classification of bone fracture, making it ideal for future clinical application.
