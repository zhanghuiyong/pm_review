AB  - In addressing the critical need for early detection of COVID-19 and viral pneumonia, our study introduces an advanced system using deep learning for analyzing chest X-ray images and their respective lung masks. Utilizing the comprehensive COVID-QU-Ex dataset, we extensively trained and evaluated five pre-trained deep learning models (ResNet-18, VGG-16, AlexNet, Inception-V3, and DenseNet-169) and developed a novel ensemble model. This ensemble model, combining the strengths of the top-performing models, achieved a notable 96.002% prediction accuracy and 95% recall, outperforming the individual models. Our research goes a step further by integrating explainable AI methodologies, specifically LIME and SHAP, to provide understandable and transparent explanations of the model’s decision-making process. These explanations are crucial for identifying critical areas of lung infections and enhancing the model’s credibility. Furthermore, we deployed a user-friendly Flask web application, enabling easy access to our system for medical professionals. This application offers immediate analysis of uploaded X-ray images, delivering predictions, accuracy percentages, and interpretative visual explanations. Our work significantly advances the field by providing an accurate, explainable, and accessible tool for early lung disease detection, potentially revolutionizing the approach to healthcare diagnostics.

AB  - One of the main causes of death and disability worldwide is lung illness, commonly known as a respiratory disease. Pneumonia is one of the most common respiratory diseases, and according to the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health report titled “Lung Cancer is one of the leading cause o death among women and men, with a rate of 5 million cases per year. Pneumonia and Diarrhea Progress Report 2020,” 1.23 million children under the age of five died from pneumonia in 2015. These statistics are from the Forum of International Respiratory Societies.334 million people suffered from asthma disease, different pandemics like Covid19 affected lives of many people. Traditional methods for lung detection included blood tests, sputum tests, chest X-rays, and CT scans. More recently, deep learning models have been used to evaluate automatic analysis and classify regions of chest X-rays into diseased and non-diseased states (for example, TB and Non-TB or malignant or benign tumors)[1]. Deep learning’s “black box” model is explained in detail by explainable AI, which also clarifies the patient’s or examination’s symptoms. In this paper we will exaggerate different deep learning and explainable techniques along with parameter comparison for diagnosis of pulmonary diseases like TB, lung cancer, pneumonia and interstitial lung diseases. This survey aims at getting acquainted with different techniques of detection of lung disease’s using various types of CNN model’s and various types of machine learning classifiers with explainable AI like Grad CAM, Score CAM etc for visualization of disease infected regions Also the study and analysis of different models will help researchers in their studies. Future scope and challenges are also given for further expansion of techniques.

AB  - Machine learning has shown great promise in a variety of applications, but the deployment of these systems is hindered by the "opaque" nature of machine learning algorithms. This has led to the development of explainable AI methods, which aim to provide insights into complex algorithms through explanations that are comprehensible to humans. However, many of the explanations currently available are technically focused and reflect what machine learning researchers believe constitutes a good explanation, rather than what users actually want. This paper highlights the need to develop human-centred explanations for machine learning-based clinical decision support systems, as clinicians who typically have limited knowledge of machine learning techniques are the users of these systems. The authors define the requirements for human-centred explanations, then briefly discuss the current state of available explainable AI methods, and finally analyse the gaps between human-centred explanations and current explainable AI methods. A clinical use case is presented to demonstrate the vision for human-centred explanations.

AB  - Monitoring fetal health and classifying it into different classes is crucial to prevent adverse situations. Healthy fetus leads to healthy new generations. Early detection and treatment of any medical condition is supreme for the well-being and safety of both mother and newborn. This work presents a novel approach to fetal health classification using machine learning models. Three classes—Normal, Suspect, and Pathological—are created by selecting pertinent features from the Cardiotocography (CTG) dataset. Predictive models are created using machine learning (ML) techniques, such as XGBoost, Voting Classifier, Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression (LR). XGBoost model has performed well and attained an accuracy-94%. RF model gave the highest precision and recall for classifying normal and suspect classes. Furthermore, this work also uses Explainable AI (XAI) tool called SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to know/interpret how RF model produces the outcome for test data. ML embedded with XAI supports healthcare providers to trust the model as well as timely intervention of doctors leads to better pregnancy outcomes and maternal-infant health.

AB  - In developing nations, diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of blindness. It often has no early warning signs; however, monitoring the eyes could prevent the progression to more severe forms of sight-threatening retinopathy and macu-lopathy. The primary diagnostic method for diabetic retinopathy is analyzing fundoscopic images; however, manually examining such images can be time-consuming and unreliable because the ability to spot abnormalities varies with the physician's exper-tise. This manual effort has been lessened by computer-aided diagnosis tools that automatically detect diabetic retinopathy on retinal scans. Deep Learning techniques offer an excellent way of creating computer-aided diagnosis tools, delivering highly efficacious diabetic retinopathy detection and grading results. This review lists the current state-of-the-art Deep Learning approaches in the application of detection and grading of diabetic retinopathy, some of which include transfer learning, Convolutional Neural Networks, and object detection techniques, among others. It further identifies potential research gaps in these approaches and the future research direction to find solutions to address them.

AB  - Accurate cost prediction of healthcare resources is challenging as diverse factors affect the overall prediction. The cost of healthcare providers is increasing exponentially as different healthcare providers charge differently for the same service due to various factors, majorly the sky rocketing inflation and increased population. It increases the importance of predicting healthcare costs to avoid unpleasant surprises. This study aims to provide the expected cost of healthcare providers that helps the patients in resource allocation and strengthens decision-making according to their resources. This paper proposes three hybrid Deep Learning (DL) models, Visual Geometry Group and Stacked Autoencoder (VGG-SAE), Visual Geometry Group and Deep Neural Network (VGG-DNN), and Stacked Autoencoder and Deep Neural Network (SAE-DNN), which optimize learning the hidden patterns from the given data more efficiently than individual models. The three hybrid DL models estimate the cost of healthcare providers effectively. The preprocessing is performed using the mode imputation for handling the missing values, Z-score for removing the outliers and standard scaler for standardizing the data. To train the hybrid models on optimum parameters, the Random Search technique is used that provides the best hyper-parameters of each hybrid model. The interpretation of the hybrid models’ output is achieved using the SHapley Additive ExPlanations (SHAP) technique. The performances of VGG-SAE, VGG-DNN, and SAE-DNN are compared with the baseline DL models such as SAE, DNN, and VGG. To assess the robustness of the proposed approach, the hybrid models are trained on two different datasets of healthcare such as Healthcare Providers and Hospital Inpatient Cost Transparency. With the hyper-parameter tuning of the Healthcare Providers Dataset, VGG-SAE achieved MSE of 0.01, RMSE of 0.13, MAE of 0.02, and R-squared of 0.98. VGG-DNN achieved MSE of 0.01, RMSE of 0.12, MAE of 0.02, and R-squared of 0.99. SAE-DNN achieved MSE of 0.01, RMSE of 0.11, MAE of 0.02, and R-squared of 0.99. With the hyper-parameter tuning of the Hospital Inpatient Cost Transparency Dataset, VGG-SAE achieved MSE of 0.007, RMSE of 0.08, MAE of 0.03, R-squared of 0.99, and execution time of 1680 seconds. VGG-DNN achieved MSE of 0.0006, RMSE of 0.08, MAE of 0.03, R-squared of 0.99, and execution time of 645 seconds. SAE-DNN achieved MSE of 0.003, RMSE of 0.06, MAE of 0.02, R-squared of 0.99, and execution time of 850 seconds. Our proposed hybrid combinations outperformed other deep models and Machine Learning (ML) techniques such as SAE, DNN, VGG, SVR and GBR, which ensures high efficiency of the proposed models in terms of healthcare providers cost.

AB  - The most prevalent problems in healthcare in India are related to doctors' referral processes, data transmission between health facilities, and patient portals for accessing their medical records. Furthermore, the preservation and distribution of Electronic Medical Records (EMR) is a critical necessity for health organizations since they hold all confidential health data about patients. However, because most Indian health institutions employ centralized outsourced systems, they have issues with EMR security and interoperability. In this paper, we present a Blockchain-based technological architecture for EMR management in Indian health institutions. Due to Blockchain's properties such as privacy, security, transparency, and immutability, we have implemented it in the architecture to address several issues within healthcare.

AB  - The Metaverse is an online universe that combines virtual reality and augmented reality, linked together via a network.It has generated novel experiences that are fully engaging and transpire in real time, facilitating interpersonal communication and dialogue. Virtual environments with 3D space and avatars can boost patient-facing platforms, operational utilisation, digital education, diagnostics, and treatment choices in medicine and ophthalmology. Globally, there is an increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, with an estimated 25 percent of individuals presently contending with multiple chronic health issues. The management of chronic diseases is currently being rethought in light of the development of technology known together as “Smart Healthcare.” A prime example is state-of-the-art wearable technology that incentivizes people to embrace healthier lifestyles through the monitoring of physiological indicators and metabolic processes. With better data organisation and analysis, chronic disease patients may benefit from improved health, privacy, and quality of life. Through the examination of physiological data acquired from wearable devices on a patient, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the capability to generate informed recommendations pertaining to the diagnosis and treatment of illness. These recommendations can be provided by AI. The adoption of blockchain technology (BC) has the potential to significantly advance healthcare in a variety of ways, including decentralised data sharing, user privacy, user empowerment, and dependability in data administration. The potential impact of Wearable Technologies (WT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Blockchain Technology (BC) on Chronic Disease Management (CDM) could be a transition in emphasis from the hospital to the patient. This article provides a patient-centered technical framework for controlling chronic diseases using artificial intelligence, blockchain, and wearable technologies. Our proposed architecture depends on Metaverse environment. In order to participate in the Metaverse, both patients and physicians need to sign up on the Blockchain network. After entering, customers will be accompanied by avatars throughout the experience. A comprehensive record of all information gathered during doctor-patient consultations, including text, videos, images, audio, and clinical data, will be compiled, uploaded to the blockchain, and stored in perpetuity. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) algorithms examine these particulars in order to diagnose and forecast the progression of diseases. We conclude with a discussion of the constraints of this novel paradigm and recommendations for future research.

AB  - Since its first appearance, artificial intelligence has been ensuring revolutionary outcomes in the context of real-world problems. At this point, it has strong relations with biomedical and today&#x2019;s intelligent systems compete with human capabilities in medical tasks. However, advanced use of artificial intelligence causes intelligent systems to be black-box. That situation is not good for building trustworthy intelligent systems in medical applications. For a remarkable amount of time, researchers have tried to solve the black-box issue by using modular additions, which have led to the rise of the term: interpretable artificial intelligence. As the literature matured (as a result of, in particular, deep learning), that term transformed into explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). This book provides an essential edited work regarding the latest advancements in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for biomedical applications. It includes not only introductive perspectives but also applied touches and discussions regarding critical problems as well as future insights. Topics discussed in the book include: &#x2022; XAI for the applications with medical images &#x2022; XAI use cases for alternative medical data/task &#x2022; Different XAI methods for biomedical applications &#x2022; Reviews for the XAI research for critical biomedical problems. Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Biomedical Applications is ideal for academicians, researchers, students, engineers, and experts from the fields of computer science, biomedical, medical, and health sciences. It also welcomes all readers of different fields to be informed about use cases of XAI in black-box artificial intelligence. In this sense, the book can be used for both teaching and reference source purposes.

Many successes have been reported where AI systems even surpassed the accuracy of human experts. However, AI systems may produce errors, can exhibit bias, may be sensitive to noise in the data, and often lack technical and judicial transparency resulting in reduction in trust and challenges to their adoption. These recent shortcomings and concerns have been documented in both the scientific and general press such as accidents with self-driving cars, biases in healthcare or hiring and face recognition systems for people of color, and seemingly correct decisions later found to be made due to wrong reasons etc. This has resulted in the emergence of many government and regulatory initiatives requiring trustworthy and ethical AI to provide accuracy and robustness, some form of explainability, human control and oversight, elimination of bias, judicial transparency and safety. The challenges in delivery of trustworthy AI systems have motivated intense research on explainable AI systems (XAI). The original aim of XAI is to provide human understandable information of how AI systems make their decisions in order to increase user trust. In this paper we first very briefly summarize current XAI work and then challenge the recent arguments that present “accuracy vs. explainability” as being mutually exclusive and for focusing mainly on deep learning with its limited XAI capabilities. We then present our recommendations for the broad use of XAI in all stages of delivery of high stakes trustworthy AI systems, e.g., development; validation/certification; and trustworthy production and maintenance.

AB  - Machine learning and Blockchain are two of the most noticeable technologies during the last years. The first one is based on artificial intelligence and big data, and the second one has significantly revolutionized different scopes from fintech to entertainment to healthcare by adding transparency, immutability, and a layer of security into their ecosystem. Both technologies are data-driven, allowing researchers to take an enhanced interest to study their integration for secure, immutable, and efficient data sharing and analysis. We are interested in the converging of these two technologies and we propose a decentralized and efficient framework for the training of machine learning (ML) algorithms over Blockchain called SuperChain. Mainly, we consider the training of supervised learning algorithms such as Regression, k-nearest neighbors (KNN) and decision trees. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework is reliable and trustworthy and improve the efficiency of supervised learning models.

AB  - The democratization of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought substantial achievements in science, engineering disciplines, and society as a whole. New technologies based on large language models, multi-modal learning, embodied AI, and the quest for artificial general intelligence (AGI) promise to further change the world's landscape as we know it. At the same time, AI's rapid and uncontrolled evolution also poses serious risks to society, such as the concentration of power, exclusion, discrimination, and manipulation of reality. The keynote will present some experiences in AI democratization, including the usage of explainable machine learning approaches for agronomists, NLP-based solutions for railway engineers, image processing techniques for the maintenance of riverbeds, and mobile data processing in road safety assessment. The talk will outline the latest technological advancements in AI, e.g., in healthcare and science, and will show how large language models like ChatGPT and Bing Chat can solve long-standing requirements engineering (RE) problems. For example, requirements completeness can be easily checked and addressed with simple prompts, and model generation from requirements becomes a one-click task. The keynote will then describe the risks that current AI development poses to society. Besides the increasingly convincing deep fakes, and the widely discussed risks for privacy and reputation, we must be aware of the uncontrolled speed of AI evolution. As AI continues to advance, it will replace many jobs that require intellectual skills. This could lead to a significant number of people losing their jobs, as they may not have the necessary skills to adapt to the new labour market. People and entire countries that cannot exploit technological developments will be excluded from the game, and this will cause resentment and the possible emergence of new fundamentalism. The race for semiconductors is already creating hot spots and rifts between the superpowers. In this context, RE researchers are called to new technical and societal challenges. With pieces of code and even entire programs that can be automatically generated with large language models, the craft of prompting becomes the new requirements specification, and the concept of structured APIs dissolves into natural language interfaces. At the societal level, AI regulations are making their first steps, and we are called to contribute to operationalise the norms while preventing over-regulation. Equipped with years of experience at the boundary of the technical and social facets of systems, RE researchers are pivotal subjects in the new golden age of AI.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) systems have many applications with tremendous current and future value to human society. As AI systems penetrate the aspects of everyday life, a pressing need arises to explain their decision-making processes to build trust and familiarity among end users. In high-stakes fields such as healthcare and self-driving cars, AI systems are required to have a minimum standard for accuracy and to provide well-designed explanations for their output, especially when they impact human life. Although many techniques have been developed to make algorithms explainable in human terms, no design methodologies that will allow software teams to systematically draw out and address explainability-related issues during AI design and conception have been established. In response to this gap, we proposed the explainability in design (EID) methodological framework for addressing explainability problems in AI systems. We explored the literature on AI explainability to narrow down the field into six major explainability principles that will aid designers in brainstorming around the metrics and guide the critical thinking process. EID is a step-by-step guide to AI design that has been refined over a series of user studies and interviews with experts in AI explainability. It is devised for software design teams to uncover and resolve potential issues in their AI products and to simply refine and explore the explainability of their products and systems. The EID methodology is a novel framework that aids in the design and conception stages of the AI pipeline and can be integrated into the form of a step-by-step card game. Empirical studies involving AI system designers have shown that EID can decrease the barrier of entry and the time and experience required to effectively make well-informed decisions for integrating explainability into their AI solutions.

AB  - Amyloidosis refers to a range of medical conditions in which misshapen proteins accumulate in various organs and tissues, forming insoluble fibrils. Cardiac amyloidosis is frequently linked to the buildup of misfolded transthyretin (TTR) or immunoglobulin light chains (AL). Delayed diagnosis, due to lack of disease awareness, results in a poor prognosis, especially in patients with AL amyloidosis. Early identification is therefore a key factor to improve patient outcomes. This study investigates the use of supervised machine-learning algorithms to support clinicians in classifying amyloidosis and control subjects. The aim of this work is to foster model interpretability reporting the most important risk factors in predicting the presence of cardiac amyloidosis. We analyzed electronic health records (EHRs) of 418 participants acquired in a time window of 12 years as part of a case-control study conducted in Fondazione Toscana Gabriele Monasterio (Italy) clinical practice. This work paves the way for the creation of digital health solutions that can aid in amyloidosis screening. The effective handling, analysis, and interpretation of these solutions can have a transformative effect on modern healthcare, offering new opportunities for improved patient care.

With a focus on feature analysis to improve accuracy and interpretability, this abstract provides an overview of deep learning models using CNNs for the study of heart disease. This study aims to build reliable CNN-based models that can precisely diagnose and forecast the prognosis of heart disease using medical data. Large datasets containing various cardiac data, including patient demographics, medical imaging scans, and electrocardiograms (ECGs), are used to train the models to accomplish. The proposed deep learning methods heavily rely on feature analysis. The most instructive and pertinent features from the input data are extracted using feature extraction techniques, and these features are then fed into the CNN models. The CNN models are trained to learn complicated patterns and correlations contained in the data, enabling precise categorization and prediction of cardiac disease. Additionally, feature analysis improves the CNN models' interpretability. To comprehend the areas and aspects of the input data that contribute the most to the model's decision-making process, methods including saliency maps, gradient-based visualization, and class activation mapping are used. This improves clinical decision-making by giving doctors and researchers important insights into the diagnostic and predictive variables of cardiac disease.

AB  - The efficient administration of healthcare resources is crucial for successful infectious disease control. The merging of technology and medicine has opened the path for revolutionary changes in today's healthcare system. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are one of them that has the potential to radically alter the way healthcare is administered. Using ANNs, this paper presents a novel method dubbed “Dynamic Patient Risk Stratification (DyPRoN).” DyPRoN performs real-time risk assessments of individual patients, allowing for flexible distribution of medical resources. Adaptability to the dynamic nature of infectious illnesses is hindered by the prevalence of static models in conventional approaches. However, DyPRoN uses ANNs to do continuous analysis of patient data, allowing for risk classification in real time. This adaptive method improves healthcare resource management, which in turn helps with infectious disease control.

This approach combines the power of ConvLSTM models in capturing spatio-temporal patterns with the interpretability of attention mechanisms, allowing for the identification of key geographic areas in the input data that contribute to the prediction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through experiments on real-world crime data, showing that our model demonstrates high accuracy in crime predictions while providing insightful visualization that enhances the interpretability of prediction results.

AB  - Malaria remains one of the deadliest diseases in underdeveloped regions, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. The lack of high-quality healthcare services and accurate disease diagnosis systems has resulted in acute medical problems for patients. This necessitates reliable automated decision-making tools to aid medical professionals in their decision-making process. This paper presents a transparent approach to malaria diagnosis by applying Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, namely Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanation (LIME), to provide meaningful interpretations of severe malaria predictions made by machine learning models. Various models, including Extreme Gradient Boosting, K-means, K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest, Naive Bayes, AdaBoost, and Explainable Boosting Machines (EBMs) are deployed for this task. The results of the study showed that Random Forest and Explainable Boosting Machines achieved the highest accuracy of 84%. EBM also provided a practical clinical understanding of features that drive clear prediction. The LR achieved an accuracy of 81% after applying GridSearchCV to increase prediction accuracy. Furthermore, K-fold validation was used on XGBoost to estimate the model’s skill on new data. The interpretations were enhanced by XAI, which revealed features that contribute to severe malaria. The application of these techniques can significantly improve the accuracy of severe malaria predictions and aid medical professionals in making informed decisions. This paper provides a compelling argument for the urgent need for XAI techniques to address the challenges associated with severe malaria diagnosis and treatment. The study’s findings demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques in enhancing the accuracy and interpretability of machine learning models, which can greatly benefit medical professionals in their decision-making process.

AB  - In recent years, the Azerbaijan Republic has been making strides in adopting Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies within its healthcare sector, reflecting a growing global trend of integrating AI into medical practices. Azerbaijan Republic’s healthcare system has embraced AI-driven solutions to improve medical services. AI algorithms are being utilized to analyze medical images, such as endoscopic pictures, X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans, aiding in the early detection of diseases like cancer. These technologies enable more accurate and rapid diagnosis, improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. Consequently, the policy and regulation of AI in medicine must be a critical endeavor that balances the transformative potential of AI with ethical and safety considerations. Striking the right balance requires addressing challenges such as patient safety, data privacy, bias mitigation, accountability, and transparency.Regulations must ensure rigorous testing, data protection, and the fair distribution of benefits while also mandating transparency in AI algorithms to foster trust among healthcare professionals and patients. Collaborative efforts among policymakers, healthcare practitioners, and AI developers are essential to harness the potential of AI while upholding ethical standards and patient well-being. This study analyzes the secondary data and explains the policy rules and regulations in AI in medical practices in developing countries, specifically in the Azerbaijan Republic.

AB  - The urgent need for an accurate and fast diagnosis of upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) has been made clear by the COVID-19 pandemic. Machine learning algorithms have shown the potential to aid early diagnosis and appropriate patient management by distinguishing COVID-19 from other URTIs. By analyzing clinical and laboratory factors, such as symptom profiles, vital signs, and laboratory markers, machine learning algorithms can identify distinctive patterns that set COVID-19 apart from other URTIs. Healthcare workers might use such approaches to make well-informed decisions about patient triage, isolation, and treatment, which could result in improved clinical outcomes and slower disease transmission. To achieve this goal, the current work utilizes a publicly accessible dataset of symptoms and Explainable AI to extract the most significant aspects of the symptoms. The class imbalanced problem in the dataset has been eradicated by Random Under Sampling technique. In addition, classification algorithms have been used to determine the type of disease from patient’s symptoms. These algorithms included Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (GB), Logistic Regression (LR), Naïve Bayes (NB), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Extra Tree (ET), Bagging Classifier (BG) and Stacking Classifier. The results of the proposed work indicate that the stacking ensemble model got the highest 97.31% of classification accuracy and outperformed the previous work.

AB  - Despite the myriad peer-reviewed papers demonstrating novel Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based solutions to COVID-19 challenges during the pandemic, few have made a significant clinical impact, especially in diagnosis and disease precision staging. One major cause for such low impact is the lack of model transparency, significantly limiting the AI adoption in real clinical practice. To solve this problem, AI models need to be explained to users. Thus, we have conducted a comprehensive study of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) using PRISMA technology. Our findings suggest that XAI can improve model performance, instill trust in the users, and assist users in decision-making. In this systematic review, we introduce common XAI techniques and their utility with specific examples of their application. We discuss the evaluation of XAI results because it is an important step for maximizing the value of AI-based clinical decision support systems. Additionally, we present the traditional, modern, and advanced XAI models to demonstrate the evolution of novel techniques. Finally, we provide a best practice guideline that developers can refer to during the model experimentation. We also offer potential solutions with specific examples for common challenges in AI model experimentation. This comprehensive review, hopefully, can promote AI adoption in biomedicine and healthcare.

AB  - Skin cancer is a prevalent form of malignancy globally, and its early and accurate diagnosis is critical for patient survival. Clinical evaluation of skin lesions is essential, but it faces challenges such as long waiting times and subjective interpretations. Deep learning techniques have been developed to tackle these challenges and assist dermatologists in making more accurate diagnoses. Prompt treatment of skin cancer is vital to prevent its progression and potentially life-threatening consequences. The use of deep learning algorithms can improve the speed and accuracy of diagnosis, leading to earlier detection and treatment. Additionally, it can reduce the workload for healthcare professionals, allowing them to concentrate on more complex cases. The goal of this study was to develop reliable deep learning (DL) prediction models for skin cancer classification; (i) deal with a typical severe class imbalance problem, which arises because the skin-affected patients’ class is significantly smaller than the healthy class; and (ii) interpret the model output to better understand the decision-making mechanism (iii) Propose an End-to-End smart healthcare system through an android application. In a comparison examination with six well-known classifiers, the effectiveness of the proposed DL technique was explored in terms of metrics relating to both generalization capability and classification accuracy. A study used the HAM10000 dataset and an optimized CNN to identify the seven forms of skin cancer. The model was trained using two optimization functions (Adam and RMSprop) and three activation functions (Relu, Swish, and Tanh). Furthermore, an XAI-based skin lesion classification system was developed, incorporating Grad-CAM and Grad-CAM++ to explain the model’s decisions. This system can help doctors make informed skin cancer diagnoses in their early stages, with an 82% classification accuracy and 0.47% loss accuracy.

AB  - The increasing availability of online medical platforms has made it easier for people to access medical information and treatment. However, it has also led to an increase in fraudulent schemes that exploit individuals seeking medical advice. This has created an exploitable opportunity for unprofessional and unqualified medical personnel operating on online platforms for telemedicine. This study illustrates and discusses the use of Artificial Intelligence, specifically Natural Language Processing (NLP), to detect trustworthy medical sentiments in online maternal and neonatal healthcare advice. Interpretable detection of medical sentiments in crowdsourced advice from both medical experts and regular individuals on social media platforms was done. In this approach, the “Explain Like I'm 5” (ELi5) technique is used to make the detection process more understandable and trustworthy. Our findings demonstrate an urgent need for a maternal and neonatal medical corpus and the use of explainable AI to ensure a sustainable and trustworthy healthcare for all with Conversational AI.

AB  - In the field of dermatology, skin disorders, particularly hair-related conditions, present a significant challenge. Image-based automated categorization of hair problems has gained a significant research attention due to its potential to assist dermatologists in the process of early diagnosis and treatment planning. Transfer learning, a technique that utilizes pre-trained deep neural networks, has proven to be valuable in various computer vision applications. This study investigates the application of transfer learning for leveraging a multiclass classification of hair disorders by utilizing the three commonly used Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures: AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet50. This research study begins with the collection of a comprehensive dataset comprising high-resolution images of various hair disorders, including but not limited to alopecia areata, tinea capitis, and androgenetic alopecia. Categorizing the dataset into different groups based on the type and severity of each condition enables a thorough evaluation of the models. Transfer learning approach is employed for fine-tuning these neural network architectures by using the hair disease dataset. A hyperparameter tuning strategy is also adopted to optimize different parameters such as learning rates, batch sizes, and optimization methods to enhance the model performance. The results reveal that all three architectures, including ResNet50, achieve a 99% accuracy rate in classifying multiclass hair diseases. Such technology has the potential to assist dermatologists in their clinical practice by enabling rapid and precise disease detection, thereby improving patient outcomes and healthcare efficiency. Further research could explore the integration of these models into clinical workflows and their application in telemedicine for enabling remote diagnosis and consultation.

AB  - In medicine, triage is a process that rations health services towards patients who are most in need of immediate care. Traditionally, a nurse will carry out an evaluation to ascertain a patient's condition and assign an Emergency Severity Index(ESI) to represent the urgency level needed to attend to them, which is time-consuming and subject to human error and bias. Mistriage could potentially lead to delayed medical attendance and ultimately to death if the condition is not managed, while no triage could overwhelm the finite hospital resources and medical personnel in trying to attend to the huge patient volumes. Existing research in the domain largely focuses on the prediction of patient disposition(whether or not one will be admitted). This work proposes using Explainable AI to generate insights that can support human-in-the-loop Machine Learning triage of patients at the emergency department level. This research utilized Machine learning classification algorithms like the Decision Trees classifier, Random forest classifier, Histogram-Based Gradient Boosting classifier, XGBoost classifier, and ELM Classifier to predict the Emergency Severity Index of a patient based on their medical data. Upon hyperparameter tuning, the models are evaluated and the Histogram-Based Gradient Boosting classifier topped them all as the best-performing model with an average Area Under the Curve(AUC) score of 91 % over the 5 classes and an F1 score of 70%. Explainable AI(XAI) techniques like Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations(LIME) and Shapley Additive Explanations(SHAP) were used to create more transparent and trustworthy algorithms for Intelligent Healthcare.

AB  - Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is currently experiencing a growing worldwide incidence and can lead to premature mortality if diagnosed late, resulting in rising costs to healthcare systems. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) offer the possibility of an early diagnosis of CKD that could revert further kidney damage. However, clinicians may be hesitant to adopt AI models if the reasoning behind the predictions is not understandable. Since eXplainable AI (XAI) addresses the clinicians’ requirement of understanding AI models’ output, this work presents the development and evaluation of an explainable CKD prediction model that provides information about how different patient’s clinical features contribute to CKD early diagnosis. The model was developed using an optimization framework that balances classification accuracy and explainability. The main contribution of the paper lies in an explainable data-driven approach to offer quantitative information about the contribution of certain clinical features in the early diagnosis of CKD. As a result, the optimal explainable prediction model implements an extreme gradient boosting classifier using 3 features (hemoglobin, specific gravity, and hypertension) with an accuracy of 99.2% (standard deviation 0.8) and 97.5% with a 5-fold cross-validation and with new unseen data respectively. In addition, an explainability analysis shows that hemoglobin is the most relevant feature that influences the prediction, followed by specific gravity and hypertension. This small number of features selected results in a reduced cost of the early diagnosis of CKD implying a promising solution for developing countries.

AB  - Healthcare agents, in particular in the oncology field, are currently collecting vast amounts of diverse patient data. In this context, some decision-support systems, mostly based on deep learning techniques, have already been approved for clinical purposes. Despite all the efforts in introducing artificial intelligence methods in the workflow of clinicians, its lack of interpretability - understand how the methods make decisions - still inhibits their dissemination in clinical practice. The aim of this article is to present an easy guide for oncologists explaining how these methods make decisions and illustrating the strategies to explain them. Theoretical concepts were illustrated based on oncological examples and a literature review of research works was performed from PubMed between January 2014 to September 2020, using “deep learning techniques,” “interpretability” and “oncology” as keywords. Overall, more than 60% are related to breast, skin or brain cancers and the majority focused on explaining the importance of tumor characteristics (e.g. dimension, shape) in the predictions. The most used computational methods are multilayer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks. Nevertheless, despite being successfully applied in different cancers scenarios, endowing deep learning techniques with interpretability, while maintaining their performance, continues to be one of the greatest challenges of artificial intelligence.

AB  - Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a rapidly growing neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects the elderly population. Until now, there has been no antidote for PD. However, diagnosing Parkinson’s disease in its early stages is difficult. Early treatment will help people with Parkinson’s disease improve their quality of life. The primary goal of this work is to increase the early diagnostic accuracy of Parkinson’s disease using deep learning models and to make the models more transparent and trustworthy. It proved challenging to comprehend the methods by which the classifiers made predictions about Parkinson’s disease. It would be valuable if the outcomes generated by these classifiers could be clarified in a reliable and trustworthy manner. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (EXAI) focuses on enhancing clinical health practises and bringing transparency to predictive analysis, both of which are critical in the healthcare arena. We proposed a new hybrid deep transfer learning model to distinguish PD patients from healthy individuals. The proposed architecture combines the advantages of both VGG19 Net and Google Net. This study also shows the experimental outcomes of various pre-trained models such as Alex Net, DenseNet-201, VGG-19 Net, Squeeze Net1.1, and ResNet-50. The VGG19-INC model predicts PD with an accuracy of 98.45%, which is greater than other state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating the proposed work’s superiority and robustness. To demystify the VGG19-INC model, explainable AI approaches such as LIME are used to identify the specific parts of the spiral and wave drawings that contribute most to the model’s prediction. These methods provide local interpretation, making it easier to understand how the model arrives at its conclusions.

Prediction modelling was carried out using the MIMIC-IV-ED dataset that contains over 400,000 ED visits for predicting hospitalisation Yes vs No (discharged). The Gradient Boosting (GB) prediction modelling gave the best performance achieving an accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 83%, 82% and 84% respectively. These results are comparable with previous studies published in the literature. Subsequently, interpretable rules were extracted with a high precision threshold, demonstrating the rules’ overall accuracy in replicating the model’s behaviour. Further work is needed to validate the rules extracted with the ED medical experts as well as to benchmark the findings with other models and studies.Clinical Relevance: The use of explainable AI (XAI) in predicting hospitalization outcomes in the Emergency Department (ED) using machine learning and rule extraction, has the potential to improve clinical decision-making.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) is well-suited to help support complex decision-making tasks within clinical medicine, including clinical imaging applications like radiographic differential diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) tumors. So far, there have been numerous examples of theoretical AI solutions for this space, for example, large-scale corporate efforts like IBM’s Watson AI. However, clinical implementation remains limited due to factors related to the alignment of this technology in the clinical setting. User-Centered Design (UCD) is a design philosophy that focuses on developing tailored solutions for specific users or user groups. In this study, we applied UCD to develop an explainable AI tool to support clinicians in our use case. Through four design iterations, starting from basic functionality and visualizations, we progressed to functional prototypes in a realistic testing environment. We discuss our motivation and approach for each iteration, along with key insights gained. This UCD process has advanced our conceptual idea from feasibility testing to interactive functional AI interfaces designed for specific clinical and cognitive tasks. It has also provided us with directions to develop further an AI system for the non-invasive diagnosis of CNS tumors.

AB  - This paper presents a novel Clinical Decision Support System based on eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI-CDSS) as a comprehensive structured tool consisting of three main parts: predictive models, XAI interpretation, and a graph-based visualization of non-communicable pathologies. Machine learning models are proposed to predict the risk factors related to the direct association between obesity and comorbidities such as cardiovascular, heart disease, and diabetes. Multilayer perceptron and extreme gradient boosting are chosen among different machine learning algorithms as the best performing for the risk factors prediction of the selected comorbidities. They perform prediction with an accuracy of 0.72 for diabetes, and 0.73 for cardiovascular and heart disease. The intuitive XAI interface gives the end-user insight into the machine learning decision process, while the graph visualization links such co-occurrent pathologies to many other non-communicable diseases and provides a global view to healthcare professionals, usable for obesity and associated pathologies prevention and long-term treatment and care.

AB  - Skin disease is a major health issue worldwide, with over 5 million new cases diagnosed each year. Early detection of skin disease is crucial for successful treatment, but many people lack access to regular dermatology check-ups or may not recognize the signs of skin disease. In this project, we developed a mobile application called Skin Vision, which uses automated image analysis to detect potential skin diseases. The application allows users to take a photo of a skin lesion and receive an immediate risk assessment of the lesion’s likelihood of being diseased. To develop Skin-Vision, we used Convolutions Neural Networks (CNN), a type of deep learning algorithm that is highly effective for image analysis. We trained the model using a large dataset of skin lesion images, which included benign lesions as well as several types of skin disease. The model was able to learn the characteristics of different types of skin lesions and accurately classify them based on their features. Once a user takes a photo of a skin lesion with Skin-Vision, the image is sent to the server for analysis. The CNN algorithm processes the image and assigns a risk score to the lesion based on its likelihood of being diseased. The application then provides the user with educational information about skin disease and recommendations for further action, such as scheduling a dermatology appointment. Skin-Vision has the potential to improve the early detection of skin disease and reduce the burden on healthcare systems by providing accessible and convenient skin disease screening for the general public. Our CNN-based approach demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning algorithms in healthcare applications and can be extended to other medical imaging tasks for improved diagnosis and treatment.

AB  - Explaining increasingly complex machine learning will remain crucial to cope with risks, regulations, responsibilities, and human support in healthcare. However, extant explainable systems mostly provide explanations that mismatch clinical users’ conceptions and fail their expectations to leverage validated and clinically relevant information. A key to more user-centric and satisfying explanations can be seen in combining data-driven and knowledge-based systems, i.e., to utilize prior knowledge jointly with the patterns learned from data. We conduct a structured review of knowledge-informed machine learning in healthcare. In this article, we build on a framework to characterize user knowledge and prior knowledge embodied in explanations. Specifically, we explicate the types and contexts of knowledge to examine the fit between knowledge-informed approaches and users. Our results highlight that knowledge-informed machine learning is a promising paradigm to enrich former data-driven systems, yielding explanations that can increase formal understanding, convey useful medical knowledge, and are more intuitive. Although complying with medical conception, it still needs to be investigated whether knowledge-informed explanations increase medical user acceptance and trust in clinical machine learning-based information systems.

AB  - The importance of understanding and explaining the associated classification results in the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) in many different practical applications (e.g., cyber security and forensics) has contributed to the trend of moving away from black-box / opaque AI towards explainable AI (XAI). In this article, we propose the first interpretable autoencoder based on decision trees, which is designed to handle categorical data without the need to transform the data representation. Furthermore, our proposed interpretable autoencoder provides a natural explanation for experts in the application area. The experimental findings show that our proposed interpretable autoencoder is among the top-ranked anomaly detection algorithms, along with one-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Gaussian Mixture. More specifically, our proposal is on average 2% below the best Area Under the Curve (AUC) result and 3% over the other Average Precision scores, in comparison to One-class SVM, Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor, Elliptic Envelope, Gaussian Mixture Model, and eForest.

AB  - The healthcare sector has undergone a significant transformation with the widespread adoption of Deep Neural Networks (DNN). However, due to privacy constraints and stringent latency requirements, online remote inference is not a viable option in healthcare scenarios. Many efforts have been conducted to enable local computation, such as network compression using pruning or DNN distribution among multiple resource-constrained devices. Yet, it is still challenging to conduct distributed inference due to the latency and energy overheads resulting from intermediate shared data. On the other hand, given that realistic healthcare systems use pre-trained models, local pruning and fine-tuning relying only on the scarce and biased data is not possible. Even pre-pruned DNNs are not efficient as they are not customized to the local load of data and the dynamics of devices. The dynamic and online pruning of DNN without fine-tuning is a promising solution; however, it was not considered in the literature as most well-known techniques do not perform well without adjustment. In this paper, driven by the data restrictions in healthcare sector, we propose a novel pruning strategy based on Explainable AI (XAI), with a target to enhance the pruned DNN performance without fine-tuning. Moreover, to maintain the highest possible accuracy, we propose to combine distribution and pruning techniques to perform online distributed inference assisted by dynamic pruning only when needed. Our experiments show the performance of our pruning criterion compared to other reference techniques, in addition to its ability to assist the distribution by reducing the shared data, while keeping high accuracy.

AB  - Heart disease is a major global health problem, and early is critical to improve patient outcomes. In this study, we look at how machine learning algorithms can be used to predict cardiac disease. To classify the presence or absence of cardiac disease, we use a dataset containing several patient variables and many famous machine learningalgorithms. Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbours, Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and MLP Classifier are among the models investigated. The characteristics needed to train and evaluate the models are extracted after preprocessing the dataset. To examine the prediction capabilities, we use accuracy scores and confusion matrices to evaluate the performance of each model. We hope to find the most effective machine learning model for predicting cardiac disease through experimentation and analysis. Our findings show that machine learning algorithms have the capacity to effectively forecast cardiac disease. The results show that [name the best-performing model] accurately classifies patients with heart disease. The model’s effectiveness is bolstered further by the accompanying confusion matrix, which provides insights into classification errors and identifies opportunities for development. The successful implementation of machine learning models for heart disease prediction could help to develop efficient diagnostic tools and help healthcare practitioners make educated decisions. The incorporation of these models into clinical practise has the potential to improve patient care and lower the burden of heart disease on individuals and healthcare systems.

AB  - Since its first appearance, artificial intelligence has been ensuring revolutionary outcomes in the context of real-world problems. At this point, it has strong relations with biomedical and today&#x2019;s intelligent systems compete with human capabilities in medical tasks. However, advanced use of artificial intelligence causes intelligent systems to be black-box. That situation is not good for building trustworthy intelligent systems in medical applications. For a remarkable amount of time, researchers have tried to solve the black-box issue by using modular additions, which have led to the rise of the term: interpretable artificial intelligence. As the literature matured (as a result of, in particular, deep learning), that term transformed into explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). This book provides an essential edited work regarding the latest advancements in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for biomedical applications. It includes not only introductive perspectives but also applied touches and discussions regarding critical problems as well as future insights. Topics discussed in the book include: &#x2022; XAI for the applications with medical images &#x2022; XAI use cases for alternative medical data/task &#x2022; Different XAI methods for biomedical applications &#x2022; Reviews for the XAI research for critical biomedical problems. Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Biomedical Applications is ideal for academicians, researchers, students, engineers, and experts from the fields of computer science, biomedical, medical, and health sciences. It also welcomes all readers of different fields to be informed about use cases of XAI in black-box artificial intelligence. In this sense, the book can be used for both teaching and reference source purposes.

AB  - The escalation of healthcare expenses has been markedly pronounced in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic’s onset. Consequently, health insurance has ascended to prominence as a critical domain of investigation, with a series of ongoing endeavors underway to navigate this complex issue. The task of forecasting medical insurance expenditures is laden with challenges, attributed to the dynamic nature of healthcare, the intricacies and occasional disarray of data, unpredictable human behaviors, economic oscillations, unforeseen events, and prevailing privacy apprehensions. In the quest to surmount these obstacles, a predictive model has been unveiled, engineered to impart insights into the nuances of healthcare pricing structures. The examination of SHAP values facilitates the discernment of pivotal elements that steer cost prognostications, a process instrumental in augmenting transparency and enabling judicious choices for both insurance entities and the insured. This inquiry underscores the cardinal role of amalgamating predictive precision with an element of transparency within the realm of healthcare insurance.

Prioritizing the goal of achieving herd immunity is crucial for reducing the spread of the virus, and thus, this research places a strong emphasis on this objective. This study aims to emphasize the importance of understanding and predicting herd immunity levels for COVID-19 using advanced machine learning algorithms to ensure high-quality predictions that are easily accessible. By leveraging various data sources such as vaccination data, population statistics, and daily COVID-19 case counts, this research study has developed predictive models to estimate the threshold required for herd immunity. Our approach involves employing a range of machine-learning techniques, induding regression analysis, and ensemble methods along with an Explainable and Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) Forecasting model, to capture the complex interactions between infection rates, vaccination campaigns, and population demographics. The performance of our models has been rigorously evaluated and validated against COVID-19 data. The proposed model combines the interpretability of the $S I R$ model with the predictive power of machine learning and Explainable-AI, providing a transparent and reliable framework for herd immunity estimation. The findings highlight the importance of explainable AI in public health decision-making and provide valuable insights into herd immunity dynamics for COVID-19.

AB  - Diagnosis of adverse neonatal outcomes is crucial for preterm survival since it enables doctors to provide timely treatment. Machine learning (ML) algorithms have been demonstrated to be effective in predicting adverse neonatal outcomes. However, most previous ML-based methods have only focused on predicting a single outcome, ignoring the potential correlations between different outcomes, and potentially leading to suboptimal results and overfitting issues. In this work, we first analyze the correlations between three adverse neonatal outcomes and then formulate the diagnosis of multiple neonatal outcomes as a multi-task learning (MTL) problem. We then propose an MTL framework to jointly predict multiple adverse neonatal outcomes. In particular, the MTL framework contains shared hidden layers and multiple task-specific branches. Extensive experiments have been conducted using Electronic Health Records (EHRs) from 121 preterm neonates. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the MTL framework.

AB  - Stroke is a dangerous medical disorder that occurs when blood flow to the brain is disrupted, resulting in neurological impairment. It is a big worldwide threat with serious health and economic implications. To solve this, researchers are developing automated stroke prediction algorithms, which would allow for early intervention and perhaps save lives. The number of people at risk for stroke is growing as the population ages, making precise and effective prediction systems increasingly critical. wo In a comparison examination with six well-known classifiers, the effectiveness of the proposed ML technique was explored in terms of metrics relating to both generalization capability and prediction accuracy. To give insight into the black-box machine learning models, we also studied two kinds of explainable techniques, namely SHAP and LIME, in this study. SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) are well-established and reliable approaches for explaining model decision-making, particularly in the medical industry. The findings of the experiment revealed that more complicated models outperformed simpler ones, with the top model obtaining almost 91% accuracy and the other models achieving 83-91% accuracy. The proposed framework, which includes global and local explainable methodologies, can aid in standardizing complicated models and gaining insight into their decision-making, which can enhance stroke care and treatment.

The methodology formalizes decision trials using feature vectors and probability distributions for AI recommendations and HI proposals. The reliability of both AI and HI decisions is crucial for effective decision-making. Trust and interpretability in AI-generated clinical decisions are essential for successful implementation. An experiment involving image classification tasks was conducted, examining human attitudes, trust, and decision-making behaviour concerning AI recommendations. Three scenarios – HI-decision, AI-decision, and joint HI-AI decision – were evaluated. Expected Calibration Errors (ECEs) were below 10%, with AI exhibiting an ECEAIof 9.7% and human an ECEH of 6.2%. ECEs were used as uncertainty scores to optimize joint decision-making rule. The trust of humans in AI was evaluated, leading to improved HI accuracy. The final decision relied on the interpretability of AI results, resulting in a 6% improvement in initial HI accuracy.

The study demonstrates the way these models are incredibly successful in improving patient outcomes and data security. The results regularly show great memory, and accuracy, alongside precision, underscoring their suitability for critical care situations. While acknowledging the importance of this accomplishment, the research also points out some possible drawbacks, such as the reliance on historical data and the requirement for more model scalability and interpretability research. Recommendations cover practical implementations, cutting-edge data security safeguards, and thorough standards. Model optimization for resource-constrained IoT devices, and edge computing, as well as improved model interpretability through comprehensibility approaches and federated learning should be prioritized in future development.

AB  - Over the decades, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning has become a transformative solution in many sectors, services, and technology platforms in a wide range of applications, such as in smart healthcare, financial, political, and surveillance systems. In such applications, a large amount of data is generated about diverse aspects of our life. Although utilizing AI in real-world applications provides numerous opportunities for societies and industries, it raises concerns regarding data privacy. Data used in an AI system are cleaned, integrated, and processed throughout the AI life cycle. Each of these stages can introduce unique threats to individual’s privacy and have an impact on ethical processing and protection of data. In this paper, we examine privacy risks in different phases of the AI life cycle and review the existing privacy-enhancing solutions. We introduce four different categories of privacy risk, including (i) risk of identification, (ii) risk of making an inaccurate decision, (iii) risk of non-transparency in AI systems, and (iv) risk of non-compliance with privacy regulations and best practices. We then examined the potential privacy risks in each AI life cycle phase, evaluated concerns, and reviewed privacy-enhancing technologies, requirements, and process solutions to countermeasure these risks. We also reviewed some of the existing privacy protection policies and the need for compliance with available privacy regulations in AI-based systems. The main contribution of this survey is examining privacy challenges and solutions, including technology, process, and privacy legislation in the entire AI life cycle. In each phase of the AI life cycle, open challenges have been identified.

AB  - Cough parameter is an important measure indicator for COVID-19 disease spread by SARS COV-2 Virus and an indicator for 100 different diseases. Through coughing the virus can spread from person to person in very eager manner. For example, when an infected individual coughs, respiratory droplets containing the virus can be released into the air, which can affect the person who comes into contact these droplets. The collected samples of cough sound help in better screening of COVID-19 patients and their health severity. To have transparency regarding normal cough sound and infected cough sound (COVID-19), the cough audio data samples are collected from patients around the world, so it become possible to differentiate between COVID-19 positive, negative results and severe cough. The proposed AI model using VGG-19 mainly recognize the patterns in cough categorize the patient type is COVID infected or disinfected. Determining the top 13 highlights using power-hungry sequential direct decision (SFS) calculations and a VGG-19 classifier arrives at 0.94. With the continuous measures taken to stop the wide spread of SARC-COV 2 virus infection wherever today, and against comparative sicknesses in our hypothetical arrangement, with its minimal expense and ease of use, can play a very crucial for pre-diagnosis and analysis. We believe that hacking sounds recorded on mobile phones, or a web interface can be used to measure COVID19 would be easy way to monitor the patients remotely.

AB  - We introduce ExpLIMEable for enhancing the understanding of Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), with a focus on medical image analysis. LIME is a popular and widely used method in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) that provides locally faithful and interpretable post-hoc explanations for black box models. However, LIME explanations are not always robust due to variations in perturbation techniques and the selection of interpretable functions. The proposed visual analytics application aims to address these concerns by enabling the users to freely explore and compare the explanations generated by different LIME parameter instances. The application utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) for brain MRI tumor classification and allows users to customize post-hoc LIME parameters to gain insights into the model’s decision-making process. The developed application assists machine learning developers in understanding the limitations of LIME and its sensitivity to different parameters, as well as the doctors in providing an explanation to machine learning models, enabling more informed decision-making, with the ultimate goal of improving its robustness and explanation quality.

AB  - This paper introduces a novel AI-driven ontologybased framework for disease diagnosis and prediction, leveraging the advancements in machine learning and data mining. We have constructed a comprehensive ontology that maps the complex relationships between a multitude of diseases and their manifested symptoms. Utilizing Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL), we have engineered a set of robust rules that facilitate the intelligent prediction of diseases, embodying the principles of NLP for enhanced interpretability. The developed system operates in two fundamental stages. Initially, we define a sophisticated class hierarchy within our ontology, detailing the intricate object and data properties with precision—a process that showcases our application of computer vision techniques to interpret and categorize medical imagery. The second stage focuses on the application of AI-powered rules, which are executed to systematically extract and present detailed disease information, including symptomatology, adhering to established medical protocols. The efficacy of our ontology is validated through extensive evaluations, demonstrating its capability to not only accurately diagnose but also predict diseases, with a particular emphasis on the AI methodologies employed. Furthermore, the system calculates a final risk score for the user, derived from a meticulous analysis of the results. This score is a testament to the seamless integration of AI and ML in developing a user-centric diagnostic tool, promising a significant impact on future research in AI, ML, NLP, and robotics within the medical domain.

AB  - Hypothermia is a medical emergency that occurs when there is a low body temperature from the normal body temperature of 35oC. The occurrence of this emergency reportedly ranges from 33% to 89% during general surgical operations and often leads to extremely short and long-term complications. Fortunately, there has been a growing trend in using electronics and informatics for smart healthcare, particularly in using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) as innovative applications for predicting medical emergencies. In this paper, the use of Interpretable Machine Learning Regressors for Mild Hypothermia Prediction in General Surgical Operations was leveraged. Specifically, building, testing, and optimization of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), Linear, Random Forest (RF), Logistic, and Support Vector Machine regression models were done where an accuracy of 98.76%, 98.79%, 98.69%, 73.28%, and 29.34% respectively was obtained upon model tuning and hyperparameter optimization. SHapely Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) based on physiological vitals were transparently provided. This work can contribute to Society 5.0 by improving patient outcomes of general surgical operations, reducing healthcare costs, and increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of Intelligent Healthcare Systems.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence has been a boon to healthcare for quite a long time. While AI has the potential to assist in several domains, blood smear analysis has several challenges that need to be addressed to ensure the accuracy, interpretability, safety, and ethical use of AI in this context. Proper validation, overlapping of cells, data availability, addressing biases, interpretability, regulatory compliance, workflow integration, and ethical considerations are important aspects that must be carefully considered when using AI in blood smear analysis. One of the lesser-tackled problems through Artificial Intelligence is the classification of sickle cells. Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder affecting the hemoglobin resulting in a reduced supply of oxygen to the entire body. Currently, there is no cure for sickle cell disease, and treatment is focused on managing symptoms and preventing complications. Manual identification and classification of sickle cells in blood smear images can be time-consuming and prone to human error. Hence, there is a need for automated methods to classify sickle cells and tackle these problems. This paper discusses a deep learning model to detect the presence of sickle cells in the blood, thereby classifying them. The model focused on here is ResNet50 giving a test accuracy of 93.88%.

The “Chronic Kidney Disease Detection” project combines nephrology and machine learning to improve the classification and early detection of CKD. We start by processing and organizing healthcare records creating a dataset that includes clinical, biochemical and demographic factors. To ensure accuracy we employ techniques to clean the data and minimize errors caused by outliers. Working closely with experts in both the field and machine learning we use methods to identify important features for analysis. This involves encoding variables and normalizing continuous features resulting in a feature space that includes crucial markers of renal function. Our main goal is to develop machine learning models like networks, random forests, AdaBoost classifiers, gradient boosting classifiers and CatBoost classifiers that can uncover patterns within multidimensional data. We fine tune these models architectures and techniques to extract representations while still maintaining interpretability. Through training over iterations or “epochs” our models achieve the level of robustness needed for practical implementation while demonstrating exceptional accuracy, in detecting CKD and categorizing its different stages. This research introduces a creative method that has implications, in the medical field. This model can be improve patient outcomes for slow down disease advancement allow for intervention and tailor treatment plans, to patients.

AB  - With the extensive use of Machine Learning (ML) in the biomedical field, there was an increasing need for Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to improve transparency and reveal complex hidden relationships between variables for medical practitioners, while meeting regulatory requirements. Feature Selection (FS) is widely used as a part of a biomedical ML pipeline to significantly reduce the number of variables while preserving as much information as possible. However, the choice of FS methods affects the entire pipeline including the final prediction explanations, whereas very few works investigate the relationship between FS and model explanations. Through a systematic workflow performed on 145 datasets and an illustration on medical data, the present work demonstrated the promising complementarity of two metrics based on explanations (using ranking and influence changes) in addition to accuracy and retention rate to select the most appropriate FS/ML models. Measuring how much explanations differ with/without FS are particularly promising for FS methods recommendation. While reliefF generally performs the best on average, the optimal choice may vary for each dataset. Positioning FS methods in a tridimensional space, integrating explanations-based metrics, accuracy and retention rate, would allow the user to choose the priorities to be given on each of the dimensions. In biomedical applications, where each medical condition may have its own preferences, this framework will make it possible to offer the healthcare professional the appropriate FS technique, to select the variables that have an important explainable impact, even if this comes at the expense of a limited drop of accuracy.

AB  - The increasing global prevalence of diabetes mellitus has brought diabetic retinopathy (DR) to the forefront as a significant cause of visual impairment and blindness among adults. DR, a complication of diabetes, can be broadly categorized into Non-Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (NPDR) and Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR), each comprising distinct clinical stages with varying severity. The accurate and timely detection and classification of these stages are essential for preserving vision, a task that grows in importance as the worldwide diabetes epidemic continues to rise, with an estimated 693 million cases projected by 2045. In response to this healthcare challenge, the development of efficient automated systems for DR diagnosis and classification has emerged as a critical research focus. Deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have demonstrated substantial promise in addressing this issue. This research presents a comparative evaluation of three prominent CNN architectures, namely Le-Net, AlexNet, and VGG16, in the context of DR classification, aiming to provide valuable insights into their performance. Among these architectures, VGG16 emerges as the standout performer, achieving an accuracy of 74.4%. This outcome underscores the potential of VGG16 as a robust tool for DR diagnosis, with its deeper and more intricate architecture proving adept at capturing intricate retinal features. As the research landscape evolves, future directions may encompass exploring newer model variations, incorporating more extensive and diverse datasets, fine-tuning hyperparameters, and enhancing the interpretability of deep learning models for real-world medical applications, ultimately propelling the field toward more efficient and accurate DR diagnosis and classification.

AB  - This study proposes a process to generate and validate algorithmic explanations for the reasoning of an AI prediction model, implemented using a Bayesian network (BN). The intention of the generated explanations is to increase the transparency and trustworthiness of a decision-support system that uses a BN prediction model. To achieve this, explanations should be presented in an easy-to-understand, clear, and concise natural language narrative. We have developed an algorithm for explaining the reasoning of a prediction made using a BN. For the narrative part of the explanation, we use a template which presents the ‘content’ part of the explanation; this content is a word-less information structure that applies to all BNs. The template, on the other hand, needs to be designed specifically for each BN model. In this paper, we use a BN for the risk of trauma-induced coagulopathy, a critical bleeding problem. We outline a process for using experts’ explanations as the basis for designing the explanation template. We do not believe that an algorithmic explanation needs to be indistinguishable from expert explanations; instead we aim to imitate the narrative structure of explanations given by experts, although we find that there is considerable variation in these. We then consider how the generated explanations can be evaluated, since a direct comparison (in the style of a Turing test) would likely fail. We describe a study using questionnaires and interviews to evaluate the effect of an algorithmic explanation on the transparency and also on the trustworthiness of the predictions made by the system. The preliminary results of our study suggest that the presence of an explanation makes the AI model more transparent but not necessarily more trustworthy.

In this investigation the predictive competencies of machine learning algorithms utilizing a dataset comprising 25 cautiously selected attributes. CKD's pervasive impact on worldwide health necessitates progressive answers, and this observation stands at the leading edge of pioneering efforts. Interpretability techniques are applied to enhance the transparency of the models, allowing for a deeper understanding of the functions influencing CKD prediction. Validation and evaluation metrics played an important role in guiding the refinement of the model. Precision, recall, and F1 scores are carefully balanced to avoid false positives and negatives. The ADAM (Adaptive moment Estimation) algorithm was deployed to optimize the version's parameters, ensuring fast convergence and advanced predictive overall performance. ADAM is known for being less sensitive to the initial parameter values compared to some other optimization techniques. This adaptability ensures that the algorithm performs optimally throughout a variety of attributes in your dataset.

AB  - Foundation AI models have emerged as powerful pre-trained models on a large scale, capable of seamlessly handling diverse tasks across multiple domains with minimal or no fine-tuning. These models, exemplified by the impressive achievements of GPT-3 and BERT in natural language processing (NLP), as well as CLIP and DALL-E in computer vision, have garnered considerable attention for their exceptional performance. A noteworthy addition to the realm of image segmentation is the Segment Anything Model (SAM), a foundation AI model that revolutionizes image segmentation. With a single click or a natural language prompt, SAM exhibits the remarkable ability to segment any object within an image, marking a significant paradigm shift in medical image segmentation. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on labeled data and domain-specific knowledge, SAM breaks free from these constraints. Deep convolutional neural network (DCNN)-based, SAM comprises an image encoder, a prompt encoder, and a mask decoder, showcasing its efficient and flexible architecture. Medical image segmentation, in particular, benefits from SAM’s exceptional speed and high-quality segmentation. In this paper, we delve into the effectiveness of SAM for medical image segmentation shedding light on its capabilities. Moreover, our investigation explores the strengths and limitations of prompt engineering in medical computer vision applications, not only encompassing SAM but also other foundation AI models. Through this exploration, we unravel their immense potential in catalyzing a paradigm shift in the field of medical imaging.

AB  - Controlled drugs are drugs that when used ethically may prove life-saving for patients but these drugs also have the potential for abuse, misuse, and addiction. Controlled drugs are under strict government regulations, but still few people manage to diverge these drugs from the ethical system. Few recent techniques that are considered for administration of controlled drugs are Electronic Health Records (EHR), Machine Learning and Advanced Analytics, IOT, etc. But the techniques mentioned above have some disadvantages such as EHR is centralized, ML requires high computing power and is less scalable, IOT devices are expensive and are vulnerable to cyber-attacks thus compromising sensitive information. The system proposed in this paper uses an Ethereum blockchain for administration of controlled drugs. Blockchain ensures transparency, traceability, immutability, decentralization and security in the system.

AB  - Millions of people throughout the world are diagnosed with breast cancer each year, and it can be fatal in its later stages. Better patient outcomes and lower death rates depend on rapid and precise diagnosis. In this study, we provide a new method that makes use of cutting-edge deep learning algorithms to accurately detect breast cancers. To evaluate mammographic pictures with high precision, the suggested technique makes use of deep neural networks, in particular convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The main contribution is the creation of a CNN architecture that is both powerful and highly specialized for recognizing breast tumors. By autonomously learning and extracting complex information from mammograms, this architecture can distinguish between benign and malignant cancers with exceptional accuracy. A more sophisticated approach to patient management is possible thanks to the model's capacity to generate likelihood ratings for tumor malignancy. This study solves the pressing problem of lack of interpretability in deep learning models used in healthcare. The model includes an attention mechanism for seeing relevant parts of mammograms that are used to make a final diagnostic. This not only makes radiologists more confident in the model's predictions, but it also makes it easier for them to interpret and validate those predictions. In this study, we provide a deep learning-based method that greatly improves the accuracy and reliability of tumor detection, opening up a promising new path for advancing breast cancer diagnostics. This approach has the potential to significantly improve breast cancer screening and diagnosis, which might ultimately lead to earlier identification, more effective treatment, and lower breast cancer death rates. A major advance in the combat against breast cancer has been made through the integration of modern deep learning technologies into the field of medical imaging.

AB  - Proper antenatal and postnatal care are necessary to safeguard a woman's health as well as the health of her unborn child. The field of maternal healthcare is witnessing a dramatic shift as a result of recent advancements and new initiatives in medical technology. Still the issues of data security, reliability, transparency, informed decisions, and accountability in providing health care services to name a few. In order to address the aforementioned issues and challenges and reduce the rate of maternal mortality, adoption of medical technology will be essential. In this study, an attempt has been made to combine blockchain and predictive data analytics using an ensemble machine learning algorithm in order to collect, analyze, and store maternal health data securely and reliably and predict the risk level of pregnancy complications. The data stored on the blockchain cannot be altered; it serves as a secure setting for storing patient information as well as an authentic source for learning data. The publicly accessible dataset has been used to train and test the proposed blockchain-based pregnancy complications prediction system. The effectiveness of the proposed system has also been evaluated.

AB  - Cataract is the most common cause of blindness in the world, and early detection is critical for successful treatment. Deep learning algorithms have recently demonstrated promising results in automated cataract detection from fundus images. Yet, the inability of these black box models to be interpreted raises concerns regarding their clinical application. In this paper, we present an explainable approach for detecting cataracts using the VGG-19 convolutional neural network (CNN) and the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) visualization technique. We trained and tested our model using 2,112 high-resolution fundus images from a publicly available dataset. According to our findings, the proposed method obtains a very high accuracy of 97%. Furthermore, the Grad-CAM visuals show the image regions that contribute to the model's decision, providing insights into the diagnosis process and increasing the model's trustworthiness. The findings of this study could assist in improving patient outcomes and lowering healthcare costs by allowing for the early detection and diagnosis of cataracts. Overall, the combination of VGG-19 with Grad-CAM offers a viable option in the medical domain for identifying cataracts and understanding CNN - based decisions.
