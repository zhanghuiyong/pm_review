AB  - A brain stroke happens when blood flow to a part of the brain is interrupted or reduced. It is a critical medical condition that demands timely detection to prevent severe outcomes, including permanent paralysis and death. This research focuses on predicting brain stroke using machine learning (ML) and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). We employ a comprehensive dataset featuring various parameters associated with brain stroke such as age, Body Mass Index (BMI), average glucose, smoking, etc. and related diseases like hypertension and heart disease. Our objective is to develop an automated system that can accurately predict the possibility of a brain stroke. To achieve this, we utilized several classification ML models, including Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT), Adaptive Boosting (AdaB), and Categorical Boosting (CatB). Additionally, we incorporated time series feature engineering (TSFE) techniques, such as Lag Features (LF) and Rolling Statistics (RS), to enhance prediction accuracy. Our research introduces a cross-validation (CV) approach, highlighting that the XGB model with Rolling Statistics (XGB-RS) stands out as the top performer. This model achieved impressive results, with average metrics of 98.06% accuracy, 90.57% precision, 88.46% recall, 99.12% specificity, and an F1 score of 89.4%. Additionally, it utilizes a Confusion Matrix (CM) and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve. To interpret these outcomes, we employ Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), underscoring the importance of understanding the contributing factors. This research provides valuable insights into improving long-term health conditions, reducing mortality rates, and supporting healthcare professionals in managing brain stroke.

AB  - According to WHO, approximately 1.71 billion people worldwide have musculoskeletal conditions, which in- clude various issues such as intact muscles, bones, joints, and fractures. Among those, fractures are the most common. Due to the emergency nature of diagnosing fractures, there is a high chance of misdiagnosis for several reasons, such as the unavailability of radiologists, physicians' lack of experience, and other factors. Fracture diagnostic or X-ray interpretation errors can be reduced if radiographs are always read instantly by radiologists or automatically. In our study, we are focusing on automating wrist fracture diagnosis, where we are utilizing the publicly available GRAZPEDWRI-DX dataset, which consists of 20,327 wrist radiographs. We employed the YOLOv9 model for fracture detection, achieving an mAP@50 of 0.677, which surpasses previous benchmarks. For fracture classification, we trained several state-of-the-art deep learning models, including VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, EfficientNetB7, DenseNet121, MobileNet, and ConvNeXtXLarge. In particular, the YOLOv8-cls model surpassed all others in accuracy (0.93), precision (0.9352), and recall (0.8855), reaching its peak performance at epoch 70. To elucidate the decision-making process of both the detection and classification models, we generated explainable saliency maps through EigenCAM, making the models more explainable and interpretable.

Blockchain, an immutable and decentralized ledger, has caused significant disruptions in conventional data management paradigms by offering trust, transparency, and security across diverse domains, including banking, supply chain, and healthcare. Nevertheless, the integration of blockchain technology with deep learning presents a range of complex issues. The scalability of blockchain networks is a significant barrier in terms of accommodating the processing requirements of deep learning models. It is imperative to develop efficient consensus methods and network protocols in order to guarantee the prompt execution of intricate computations. In addition, the preservation of privacy holds significant importance in deep learning tasks that include large amounts of data. This underscores the need for innovative methods to securely and selectively share data on a blockchain platform. In contrast, deep learning has revolutionized the field of machine learning by demonstrating its capacity to discern complex patterns from extensive datasets. Despite the achievements of deep learning, there exist issues pertaining to interpretability, robustness, and generalization. The integration of blockchain technology has the potential to enhance model transparency and accountability by enabling traceability and auditability of model modifications and choices. Furthermore, the integration of blockchain's data integrity with deep learning has the potential to bolster the resilience of models against adversarial assaults and guarantee the reliability of training data.The amalgamation of blockchain and deep learning gives rise to a multitude of unresolved issues. The task of enhancing consensus algorithms to effectively enhance the training and validation processes of deep learning models on distributed blockchains continues to pose a substantial obstacle. One area of ongoing study involves addressing the semantic disparity between on&#x2010;chain and off&#x2010;chain data in order to enhance the efficiency of model execution. To effectively tackle these challenges, it is imperative to foster multidisciplinary cooperation among scholars specializing in cryptography, distributed systems, and machine learning.

AB  - Owing to the swift advancements in information and technology and wearable device technology, research involving bio-signals is being conducted for convenient personal identification authentication. Therefore, deep learning using electrocardiogram (ECG) signals is being developed as a next-generation user-recognition technology for application in real-life environments based on high security and accuracy. This study proposes a deep learning model that combines multilayered explainable artificial intelligence for user recognition in a real-life environment. The ECG-signal database utilizes the MIT-BIH normal sinus rhythm database (NSRDB) and a self-acquired database. A comparison between a single deep learning model and the proposed multilayer deep learning model using these signals confirmed that the proposed model achieved higher accuracy, with minimum accuracy differences of 15% and 0.2%. In addition, the recognition accuracies of the single deep learning model and multilayered deep learning model were compared five times to confirm the difference in output results caused by various factors in the single deep learning model. The user-recognition accuracies of a single deep learning model for the NSRDB exhibited a difference of 3.4%, whereas those of the multilayered model showed a difference of 0.9%. The user-recognition accuracy difference when applying the self-acquired database to the single deep learning model was 1.3%, but that of the multilayered deep learning model was 0.3%. Therefore, the multilayered deep learning model exhibited a stable user-recognition accuracy compared to that of the single structure, and the optimized area that affects the output result was confirmed.

AB  - The number of professional pathologists is not high in contrast with the total population, and, worldwide, the cases of cancer have a tendency to rise each year. In the face of this, the implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and, more specifically, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (xAI) techniques could contribute to prevent a work overload on pathologists. Despite recent advances in this subject, AI/xAI systems are still not fully integrated in the histopathology workflow. This could be due to the fact that the implementation of AI/xAI models in histopathology is subject to technical, social and legal requirements, among others. It is necessary to determine these requirements in order to solve this issue. With the intention of providing a wider picture, this article will present a rapid literature review bringing together all current requirements and obstacles that the implementation of AI/xAI faces in histopathology.

AB  - In precision medicine, deep learning models play an important role in identifying relevant biomarkers and making predictions for the early diagnosis and prognosis of diseases. While successful in developing accurate prediction models for prognosis and diagnosis, the ‘black box’ nature of deep learning poses significant challenges, which makes it difficult to have a meaningful biological interpretation. Recently, several biologically informed neural networks (BINNs), such as the Visible Neural Network and P-NET, have been proposed to incorporate biological knowledge for improved interpretation. These models assess node importance using quantitative measures such as SHAP and DeepLIFT. However, these approaches have limitations because they typically provide a single estimate of node importance without any information on the uncertainty of these estimates. This study aims to assess uncertainty of node importance through a novel statistical framework. Bootstrapping is used to calculate confidence interval of node importance. Our findings validate that the proposed statistical framework quantifies the uncertainty of nodes in BINNs. By providing robust confidence intervals of pathways and genes, this framework enhances the interpretability and reliability of BINNs.

AB  - The rapid spread of Monkeypox has underscored the importance of accurate and reliable diagnostic tools, particularly dermatological assessment. This research introduces a deep-learning method to accurately classify Monkeypox skin lesions, emphasizing transparency through model-agnostic explainability techniques. To achieve this, we incorporated local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) into our analytical framework. We developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to accurately distinguish Monkeypox skin lesions, utilizing a selected dataset of high-resolution lesion images. LIME was employed to generate detailed explanations for individual predictions, helping to pinpoint the exact features within the lesion images that most strongly influenced the model’s decisions. Additionally, SHAP was utilized to assess the contribution of every feature to the model’s overall predictions. It provides comprehensive information on the model’s behaviour and ensures consistency during decision-making. The insights derived from these explainability methods were crucial in validating the model’s reliability and interpreting misclassification instances, which informed subsequent model refinements. Quantitative results demonstrated that our model not only achieved a high accuracy of $\mathbf{9 2. 1 9 \%}$ but also concentrated on clinically significant areas of the lesions, as verified by LIME and SHAP visualizations. These findings suggest that integrating LIME and SHAP within deep learning frameworks can greatly enhance AI-powered diagnostic tools’ trustworthiness and clinical relevance. Future research will aim to extend this approach to other dermatological conditions and investigate its potential integration into clinical decision-making processes.

AB  - Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a WHO grade IV tumor and its heterogeneity pushes oncologists to focus on more personalized treatments for individual patients. This challenge is aided by radiomics, which involves the extraction of valuable features from Magnetic Resonance images, the most common non invasive method to identify Glioblastoma multiforme. Analyzing radiomic features through machine learning has been a robust way to predict overall survival (OS) days of GBM patients which significantly affects the personalized treatments and wellbeing.Despite the promise of machine learning for predicting GBM patient overall survival (OS), the limited interpretability of complex models hinders their clinical adoption and the translation of valuable insights gained from radiomic features into actionable treatment plans. Therefore, this study is focused on designing a highly accurate Random Forest (RF) model to predict the OS days of GBM patients from radiomic features and utilize SHapely Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values to provide a comprehensive interpritable analysis of the model, enabling clinicians to understand the role of radiomic features in patient survival prediction. The designed RF model achieved a validation accuracy of 62.5% surpassing previous work done on similar studies. The interpritable analysis revealed critical insights for personalized treatment, including the identification of outlier patients with unique radiomic features, risk inflection points for key features that may guide treatment decisions and pairwise interactions of radiomic features that may be novel biomarkers that affect the OS of GBM patients. This study’s findings pave the way for the development of more clinically-usable machine learning models for personalized GBM treatment planning, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize healthcare by automating the detection and classification of events and anomalies. In the scope of this work, events and anomalies are abnormalities in the patient’s data, where the former are due to a medical condition, such as a seizure or a fall, and the latter are erroneous data due to faults or malicious attacks. AI-based event and anomaly detection (EAD) and their classification can improve patient outcomes by identifying problems earlier, enabling more timely interventions while minimizing false alarms caused by anomalies. Moreover, the advancement of Medical Internet of Things (MIoT), or wearable devices, and their high processing capabilities facilitated the gathering, AI-based processing, and transmission of data, which enabled remote patient monitoring, and personalized and predictive healthcare. However, it is fundamental in healthcare to ensure the explainability of AI systems, meaning that they can provide understandable and transparent reasoning for their decisions. This article proposes an online EAD approach using a lightweight autoencoder (AE) on the MIoT. The detected abnormality is explained using KernelSHAP, an explainable AI (XAI) technique, where the explanation of the abnormality is used, by an artificial neural network (ANN), to classify it into an event or anomaly. Intensive simulations are conducted using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) data set for various physiological data. Results showed the robustness of the proposed approach in the detection and classification of events, regardless of the percentage of the present anomalies.

AB  - In today's world of technology breakthroughs, incorporating cutting-edge procedures has become essential, especially in healthcare, where an early and precise diagnosis is critical for improving patient outcomes and saving lives. Dental caries is an infectious bacterial disease primarily caused by the interaction of oral bacteria with dietary sugars, leading to plaque formation on teeth. Millions of people worldwide are facing this disease. Hypodontia is another dental term that healthcare providers use to describe congenitally missing teeth. We employed an AI-driven healthcare solution by utilizing a transformer-based image classification model, Vision Transformer (VIT), for the detection of dental caries and hypodontia. A dataset containing both periapical and panoramic dental x-rays utilized to gain maximum insights into teeth. The dataset was divided into 60% for training, 20% for testing, and 20% for validation. Data augmentation techniques are applied to enhance the diversity of training data and mitigate overfitting. The proposed model demonstrated remarkable performance and achieved an accuracy of 96.63% with evaluation matrices Precision, Recall, and F1-score of 96.60, 96.63, and 96.57 % respectively. Unlike Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) which are black boxes, we utilized the Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) models such as LIME, SHAP, and GRAD-CAM to gain insights into the inner workings of the VIT model. The XAI models contributed to fostering trust among medical dentists and medical professionals.

AB  - The position and orientation of the human neck need to be measured, analyzed, and monitored during head impacts to provide preventive healthcare measures. The proposed research explores the role of explainable Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in predicting the direction of the neck by analysing the muscle forces with appropriate explanations to support any clinical system for correct decision-making. The experimental data includes mild head impacts that were replicated with median American football simulating flexion and lateral movements and was performed on ten subjects including five male and five females. OpenSim software system is used for biomechanical modeling, simulation, and analysis and to visualize the direction of the neck. Different machine learning models including a sequential neural network model were built on the labelled tendon force muscle data. The XGB classifier achieved the best performance in predicting the neck direction with an accuracy of 98 percent. The proposed research work’s accuracy is promising when compared to existing works. Explainable Artificial Intelligence integration deduces the predictions of machine learning models adding meaningful interpretations to the achieved results.

AB  - Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition that requires early and accurate diagnosis to facilitate effective treatment. This study aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy for ASD using MRI images while improving interpretability in medical image classification through advanced machine learning techniques. We propose a modified R esNet50 architecture integrated with dual attention mechanisms-Self-Attention and Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM)—and utilize Grad-CAM for visual explanations of model predictions. This approach leverages transfer learning from pre-trained CNN models. Using the ABIDE dataset, the dual attention-enhanced ResNet50 achieved a classification accuracy of 97%, outperforming other models in precision, recall, and F1 score. The GradCAM analysis reveals significant activation in subcortical and cortical midline structures. Key subcortical regions, particularly the thalamus, corpus callosum, and cingulate gyrus, which are crucial structures in ASD research. Although these neuroimaging findings provide valuable insights into the neural basis of autism, they should be considered as supportive evidence within a comprehensive clinical diagnostic framework rather than as standalone diagnostic markers. These findings underscore the model's potential as a valuable diagnostic tool for ASD, emphasizing both high accuracy and interpretability. Future research will focus on validating the model across Indian populations and incorporating other explainability techniques to enhance its robustness and applicability.

AB  - Farmers have faced several difficulties as a result of the traditional techniques to identify leaf diseases, which have led to significant losses. Thankfully, technological developments have allowed us to effectively create leaf disease monitoring devices that help with early disease diagnosis. This paper investigates the realm of crop pest as they cause significant economic, social and environmental losses globally, making precise identification crucial for pest control in agriculture. Effective pest and disease management requires accurate and timely detection and classification of these pests and diseases. Deep learning techniques, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and YOLOv8 algorithms, have emerged as highly accurate and efficient tools for image-based pest and disease detection. Using CNN and YOLOv8 algorithms, this project aims to create a robust and efficient crop pest detection and classification system. To accomplish this goal, a large dataset of labelled images of various crop pests and diseases will be collected and preprocessed. Following that, using the prepared dataset, a CNN architecture will be designed and trained with the goal of extracting and analyzing key features from pest and disease images. Furthermore, the YOLOv8 object detection algorithm will be used to detect and classify pests and diseases in images. The trained CNN and YOLOv8 models will be integrated into an easy-to-use interface that will allow farmers and agricultural professionals to detect and identify crop pests and diseases in their fields. The proposed system’s performance will be measured using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP). The successful development of this crop pest detection and classification system will provide farmers with a valuable tool for timely and accurate pest and disease identification, ultimately contributing to improved crop health, yields, and agricultural productivity.

Blockchain's decentralized, immutable ledger offers robust data integrity and transparency, while AI techniques provide powerful tools for predictive analytics and decision-making. However, combining these two technologies introduces substantial challenges, including scalability issues, privacy concerns, and the requirement for regulatory compliance. This study systematically reviews existing literature to identify key challenges and promise solutions in the amalgamation of blockchain and AI within healthcare. We evaluate the applicability, objectives, techniques, and security measures of selected studies to assess their relevance and contribution to the field. Our findings reveal that while significant progress has been made, gaps remain in areas such as the alignment of these technologies with regulatory frameworks, the development of privacy-preserving AI methods, and the protection of AI models from adversarial attacks. The paper concludes by proposing a set of research questions and future directions to address these challenges, with the aim of advancing the secure and ethical integration of blockchain and AI in healthcare.

AB  - Deep Learning (DL) performs well in Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) classification using 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG). However, explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) in CVD classification, still remains largely qualitative. In this paper, we introduce a Region of Interest (ROI) based quantifiable xAI (qxAI), to compare different xAI techniques. Then, we add CVD specific post-processing steps, to increase the explanation performance. Furthermore, proposed qxAI enables selection of an optimal DL model, within the performance space defined by classification, explanation and time-complexity. Finally, we present two distinct use-cases, having ST Segment Elevation (STE) and First-degree Atrioventricular Block (IAVB). The proposed qxAI pipeline increases the accuracy and F1-score of post-processing explainability in STE from 50.7% to 70.5% and 26.1% to 35.8% respectively. Accuracy and F1-score of explainability in IAVB are increased from 39.2% to 40.6% and 49.8% to 71.8% respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to quantify xAI, on CVD classification.

AB  - Bone fractures, caused by impacts, trauma or conditions such as osteoporosis, require timely and precise detection for effective medical care. Traditional approaches rely on radiologists' interpretations of X-rays, which are labor-intensive and prone to errors. Machine learning (ML) presents a promising solution for enhancing fracture identification. However, the opacity of ML models presents challenges in their integration into healthcare, necessitating transparency and interpretability. This work examines the use of ML in fracture detection and incorporates Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to clarify decision-making processes and bolster model reliability. Here, Local Directional Pattern (LDP) and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) have been used for extracting the features and it is found that the Random Forest Classifier achieved the highest accuracy of 95 %. By assessing both the accuracy and interpretability of ML models in identifying fractures, this study aims to promote wider acceptance and application of AI-driven diagnostic tools in medical settings.

AB  - In this study, we look at how XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) may be used in healthcare predictive analytics to improve the speed and precision of illness detection. Thanks to its built-in regularisation algorithms that avoid overfitting and its capacity to handle big datasets, XGBoost has proved useful in a broad variety of prediction applications. It is a scalable and high-performance machine learning algorithm. In order to improve patient outcomes, healthcare providers must ensure that patients are diagnosed with chronic and life-threatening conditions including cancer, heart disease, and diabetes as soon as possible. To test how well XGBoost performs in comparison to more conventional machine learning techniques, the research makes use of healthcare datasets collected from the actual world. The effectiveness of the model in predicting illness outcomes is evaluated using critical metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Based on the findings, XGBoost is the best classifier for real-time healthcare applications because to its quicker processing efficiency and greater predictive ability. Additionally, the article delves into the model’s interpretability and how it may be integrated into clinical decision support systems. By demonstrating how XGBoost may improve diagnostic accuracy and bolster individualised treatment plans, this study adds to the expanding area of AI-driven healthcare.

AB  - Summary <p>Critical care is not an exception to how artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the healthcare industry. Artificial intelligence (AI) has grown into a disruptive technology in the healthcare industry, with the potential to transform patient care, diagnostics, and functioning effectiveness. An indication of an AI&#x2010;based ventilator unit designed to improve respirational therapy for patients in critical condition is given in this abstract. The creation of novel ventilator unit that assesses a patient's ventilator requirement is the main topic of this chapter. The ventilator is engineered to offer sophisticated monitoring, accurate regulation of breathing parameters, and flexibility to accommodate a wide range of patient requirements. The welfares and drawbacks of physical ventilator rely on the patients configuration of the device (input) as well as the analysis of the ventilator's generated strictures (outputs), that guide ventilator tactics. Tidal volume (VT), respiratory rate (RR), intrinsic PEEP, positive end&#x2010;expiratory pressure (PEEP), driving pressure (&#x394;P), transpulmonary pressure (PL), peak and plateau pressures (Ppeak and Pplat), mechanical energy, power, and intensity are a few of the crucial variables. During assisted medical ventilation, it is important to evaluate not only these measures but also the heaviness created after the initiation of inspiratory exertion and the pressure&#x2010;time product per minute (PTP/min). By continuously monitoring the aforementioned metrics and anticipating future difficulties, AI procedures are combined into the ventilator to display the patient's complaint. By integrating this AI system, healthcare expenses can be decreased and lives can be saved. The quality of care can be greatly improved. The abstract elucidates the possible advantages of an inventive artificial intelligence ventilator system with respect to enhanced patient care, decreased workload for healthcare providers, and resource optimisation. This project intends to use Artificial Intelligence to help advance ventilator technology and improve the quality of care provided in emergency rooms and intensive care units by fusing technological innovation with a patient&#x2010;centered approach.</p>

This paper presents a novel hybrid approach that leverages the power of explainable deep neural networks to enhance malware detection and classification accuracy while providing interpretable results. The proposed method combines static and dynamic analysis techniques to extract a comprehensive set of features from both executable files and runtime behaviors. These features are then processed using a custom-designed deep neural network architecture that incorporates attention mechanisms and interpretability layers. The model not only achieves high accuracy in detecting and classifying various malware families, but also offers explanations for its decisions, addressing the "black box" problem often associated with deep learning models. The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of this hybrid approach, showing significant improvements over traditional machine learning methods and baseline deep learning models. The explainable component of the system provides valuable insights into the specific characteristics and behaviors that contribute to malware identification, potentially aiding the development of more robust defense mechanisms. This research contributes to the field by offering a powerful, interpretable tool for malware analysis that can adapt to evolving threats while providing transparency in its decision-making process, thus bridging the gap between advanced AI techniques and practical cybersecurity applications.

The proposed model exhibits encouraging performance metrics, boasting precision and recall rates of 0.77 and 0.78, respectively, along with an F1-score of 0.77. This notable improvement distinguishes it from other existing deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) models that we have tested before-hand. Additionally, we attempt to enhance the interpretability and transparency of the model's decision-making process, the research integrates explainable AI techniques such as LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) and Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping). These tools play a pivotal role in providing insightful explanations for the model's predictions, thereby increasing the trustworthiness and reliability of AI in medical diagnostics, especially in the context of breast cancer detection. Moreover, the research underscores the significance of combining deep learning architectures with explainable AI methodologies, highlighting their potential to advance the accuracy and transparency of medical imaging technologies.

AB  - This research delves into the pressing public health issue of congenital syphilis in Pernambuco, Brazil, using machine learning and sophisticated data analysis techniques. Leveraging a vast dataset from the Mae Coruja Pernambucana Program, covering a decade from 2013 to 2022 with 47,604 records, the study aims to pinpoint crucial risk factors linked to congen-ital syphilis and devise effective strategies for public health interventions. Central to the analysis is the utilization of the Gaussian Naive Bayes classification algorithm, known for its simplicity and efficiency in managing vast datasets. The model's effectiveness was assessed using conventional criteria, revealing an impressive accuracy of 97 %, precision of 98 %, recall of 99%, and an Fl score of 99%. These measurements demon-strate the model's outstanding capacity to accurately detect cases of congenital syphilis while reducing the occurrence of false positives and negatives, a critical aspect in the realm of public health. Moreover, the study employs Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), specifically the Local Interpretable Model- agnostic Explanations (LIME) technique, to provide clarity on the decision-making process of the model. A key finding from the feature importance analysis was the prominence of the “MOTHER_SYPHILIS_TEST_RESULT” variable. This variable emerged as a significant predictor, indicating that the syphilis test results of mothers are crucial in predicting congenital syphilis in newborns. In summary, the study demonstrates how the utilization of machine learning and explainable AI, particularly Gaussian Naive Bayes and LIME, efficiently identifies crucial predictors of congenital syphilis, resulting in enhanced and actionable public health interventions.

AB  - Currently, lung cancer is one of the deadliest diseases that affects millions of people globally. However, Artificial Intelligence is being increasingly integrated with healthcare practices, with the goal to aid in the early diagnosis of lung cancer. Although such methods have shown very promising results, they still lack transparency to the user, which consequently could make their generalised adoption a challenging task. Therefore, in this work we explore the use of post-hoc explainable methods, to better understand the inner-workings of an already established multitasking framework that executes the segmentation and the classification task of lung nodules simultaneously. The idea behind such study is to understand how a multitasking approach impacts the model’s performance in the lung nodule classification task when compared to single-task models. Our results show that the multitasking approach works as an attention mechanism by aiding the model to learn more meaningful features. Furthermore, the multitasking framework was able to achieve a better performance in regard to the explainability metric, with an increase of 7% when compared to our baseline, and also during the classification and segmentation task, with an increase of 4.84% and 15.03% for each task respectively, when also compared to the studied baselines.

AB  - Obesity, a major global health concern, is linked to several life-threatening conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer. Early detection of obesity is crucial for effective intervention and prevention strategies. In this study, we investigate the performance of advanced machine learning techniques, specifically gradient boosting models-XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost-for predicting obesity risk levels using medical, demographic, and lifestyle data. Rigorous preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation were employed to ensure robust model development. XGBoost emerged as the most accurate model with an outstanding validation accuracy of 91.67%, followed by LightGBM and CatBoost. Despite minor overfitting in LightGBM, all three models demonstrated exceptional generalization capabilities. The findings highlight the potential of gradient boosting models for enhancing early obesity detection and personalized risk management in healthcare settings. Future work could focus on expanding the dataset, integrating explainable AI for better model interpretation, and exploring hybrid or deep learning models to further improve predictive performance. These results provide a solid foundation for implementing machine learning-based systems in public health programs aimed at combating the obesity epidemic.

AB  - Summary <p>Reliability, in machine learning, refers to using data analytics to forecast an asset's deterioration or failure rate so that it can be repaired or replaced before it completely breaks down. Manufacturing facilities, automobile facilities, or any facility that owns assets with rotating or moving parts where wear and tear of components are frequent and costs a fortune to maintain or replace can use Machine Learning approaches to predict Reliability. These approaches can be used in manufacturing facilities as well as automobile facilities. Machine learning algorithms have recently been utilized worldwide to anticipate maintenance. This is because this method has a superior accuracy rate compared to the traditional predictive maintenance strategy, which engineers have demonstrated to be true. At this point in PNG, most maintenance activities consist of corrective or preventative maintenance, which is an expensive endeavor for the company. As a result, the information used in this article comes from online research that other authors conducted on a similar subject. The purpose of this article is to assist organizations based in Papua New Guinea in maintaining their assets by utilizing Machine Learning algorithms to predict the Reliability of their assets.</p>

AB  - Recent progress in artificial intelligence has brought about a revolutionary era spanning various sectors such as transportation, healthcare, finance, and cybersecurity. In the field of transportation, these advancements empower autonomous systems to precisely perceive their surroundings, make swift and secure decisions, and operate seamlessly without human intervention. In the case of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), the perception phase, involving tasks like road surface extraction and on-road object detection, is crucial. While AVs offer benefits like improved road safety, convenience, and efficiency, they grapple with the “black box” challenge, symbolizing the opacity of their decision-making processes to humans. This absence of transparency poses acceptance, regulatory, ethical, and security issues. To tackle these challenges, our work leverages Concept Relevance Propagation (CRP), a bias-resistant Relevance-Based (RB) eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) algorithm to proffer transparent concept - level explanations to the behavior of object detection models used in AVs, for traffic perception. CRP goes beyond traditional attribution maps, by generating explanations that automatically identifies and visualizes relevant concepts within the input space. This insight sheds light on the crucial areas responsible for the behavior of object detection models used in AVs. This research aims to boost transparency, trust, and understanding in the field of AVs, fostering safer and more widely accepted autonomous systems.

AB  - Pharmacogenomics showcases the aim of precision medicine, which strives to customize treatments for individuals and specific populations. This field delves into exploring how an individuals DNA influences their response to medications. A persons genetic composition can impact the likelihood of experiencing reactions or determining the effectiveness of a medication. By providing insights into the safety and effectiveness of drug therapies pharmacogenomics holds potential for significantly enhancing health outcomes. Through advancements in targeted therapies we can precisely target abnormalities that trigger tumor growth in patients. For instance IGF1R (Insulin like Growth Factor 1 Receptor) which belongs to the tyrosine kinase receptor family plays a crucial role in promoting cell growth, survival and proliferation across different types of cancers. The overexpression of IGF1R has been observed in cancer types indicating its involvement in fueling continuous growth and survival of cancer cells. Targeting IGF1R helps address the dysregulation of this receptor within cancer cells. Artificial Intelligence (AI) comes into play by enabling prediction of suitable drugs based on a patients genomic profile thereby reducing adverse effects and improving treatment effectiveness. Parallel, here has been growing concern regarding model explanation due, to the opaque nature of model predictions. This is particularly important when it comes to modeling drug responses. In our research paper we have employed AI to gain a clear understanding of the prediction model and the factors that affect its results. The findings show that lower valued counts of YAP_pS127_Caution protein tend to negatively impact the output. Similarly lower values of YAP_pS127_Caution protein and higher valued counts of YAP_pS127 _Caution protein, Xanthine, Tyrosine tends to positively impact the output. This helps as an aiding reference in knowing which feature of an unknown cell line should be focused to know drug response prior medication of BMS-536924, BMS-754807 drug.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a critical complication of diabetes and is characterized by damage to retinal blood vessels. Without early diagnosis and treatment, it can lead to vision loss. The objective of this study is to investigate diverse methodologies to address the class imbalance issue in the retinal fundus image dataset and apply transformer-based knowledge distillation (KD) for efficient DR detection. Various deep-learning models have been implemented to classify RGB fundus images into five distinct classes of DR. The retinal fundus images of the employed APTOS dataset were classified using the following models: ResNet34, DenseNet121, GoogLeNet MobileViTv2, DeiT3, and KD. Initial training on the imbalanced APTOS dataset showed promising results, but to explore a more robust approach, two data balancing approaches were used, namely cost-sensitive learning and data augmentation. It was found that MobileViTv2 achieved the best results with the APTOS cost-sensitive learning approach, achieving a kappa score of 0.94 and a macro F1 score of 0.73. Furthermore, the KD technique with MobileViTv2 as a teacher and GoogLeNet as a student model achieved a WKS of 0.90 with significantly fewer parameters than the teacher model. Finally, the automatic predictions of the deep learning models are interpreted using the SHAP explainable AI framework. These findings suggest that the cost-sensitive approach and lightweight KD model can substantially enhance the performance of the implemented deep learning models for DR detection in memory-constrained healthcare devices.

AB  - The precise prediction of preoperative recurrence in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that is suitable for clinical application is still an open question. Recent advancements integrating genomic data with deep learning have shown promise in enhancing recurrence analysis in NSCLC patients. However, the lack of interpretability in the decision-making process of DNN models has hindered their clinical trustworthiness. In this paper, we propose a novel Biologically Informed Pathway-Aware Neural Network (BioPAN). By automatically extracting biological prior knowledge to guide the architecture of DNN models, we design a unified architecture of gene-pathway-biological process-disease. This approach endows each neuron with entity meaning and learns a multi-level view of biological pathways and processes related to recurrence for fully interpretable NSCLC recurrence prediction. We demonstrated that the proposed model well explains the molecular mechanisms linking genes to NSCLC recurrence, identifies several genes that significantly promote and inhibit recurrence, and elucidates the pivotal roles of various gene pathways at the biological process level. Moreover, it outperforms classical machine learning methods, provides fully interpretable biological information, and requires fewer parameters. Broadly, BioPAN enables clinical discovery and prediction, and may have general applicability across cancer types.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence has greatly influenced healthcare, most particularly in medical imaging. This paper represents a review in large form that classifies fetal ultrasound images with the use of convolutional neural networks and multi-Layer Perceptrons. While CNN is very good at spatial feature extraction in image classification, their lack of interpretability presents challenges toward applications in health. In this regard, we include methods of Explainable AI (XAI), more precisely Local Interpre table Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), for giving more transparency and confidence in the decision-making process of such models. The research here utilizes 12,400 fetal ultrasound images, which were classified under six anatomical structures. The CNN and MLP models showed very promising classification performances of 93.24% and 91.17%, respectively. LIME was implemented to interpret model predictions and to more clearly identify factors contributing to the classification. The results also show that explainability enhances not only trust in AI-based diagnostics but also model reliability in clinical settings.

AB  - Complex “black-box” artificial intelligence (AI) models are interpreted using interpretive machine learning and explainable AI (XAI); therefore, assessing the importance of global and local features is crucial. The previously proposed approximate inverse model explanation (AIME) offers unified explanations of global and local feature importance. This study builds on that foundation by focusing on assessing feature contributions while also examining the multicollinearity and correlation among features in XAI-derived explanations. Given that advanced AI and machine learning models inherently manage multicollinearity and correlations among features, XAI methods must be employed to clearly explain these dynamics and fully understand the estimation results and behaviors of the models. This study proposes a new technique called principal component analysis-enhanced approximate inverse model explanation (PCAIME) that extends AIME and implements dimensionality decomposition and expansion capabilities, such as PCA. PCAIME derives contributing features, demonstrates the multicollinearity and correlation between features and their contributions through a two-dimensional heat map of principal components, and reveals selected features after dimensionality reduction. Experiments using wine quality and automobile mile-per-gallon datasets were conducted to compare the effectiveness of local interpretable model-agnostic explanations, AIME, and PCAIME, particularly in analyzing local feature importance. PCAIME outperformed its counterparts by effectively revealing feature correlations and providing a more comprehensive perspective of feature interactions. Significantly, PCAIME estimated the global and local feature importance and offered novel insights by simultaneously visualizing feature correlations through heat maps. PCAIME could improve the understanding of complex algorithms and datasets, promoting transparent AI and machine learning in healthcare, finance, and public policy.

AB  - Biological age is a personalized measure of the health status of an organism, organ, or system, as opposed to simply accounting for chronological age. To date, there have been known attempts to create estimators of biological age based on various biomedical data. In this work, we focused on developing an approach for assessing heart biological age using echocardiographic data. The current study included echocardiographic data from more than 5,000 different cases. As a result, indicators such as EA (E/A ratio of maximum flow rates in the first and second phases), IVS (thickness of the interventricular septum), LVPW (thickness of the posterior left ventricular wall), LVCO (cardiac output), and RWT (relative wall thickness) showed the greatest predictive potential. Based on these parameters, we created and trained neural network models to determine heart biological age, with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of approximately 3.5 years, an R-squared (R2) value of around 0.87, and a Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (rho) greater than 0.9 in men. In women, the MAE was approximately 3.4 years, with an R2 value of around 0.89 and a rho greater than 0.9. In addition, we have applied an AI explanation algorithm to improve understanding of how the model performs an assessment. Furthermore, the EchoAGE model was tested on echo cardiographic data from patients with age-related diseases, patients with multimorbidity, children with progeria syndrome, and diachronic data series.
