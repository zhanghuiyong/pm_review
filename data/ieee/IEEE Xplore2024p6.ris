AB  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) continue to be the major cause of mortality worldwide, emphasizing the critical need for early detection methods. Identifying heart disease in its initial stages poses a considerable challenge for healthcare providers. However, recent advancements in diagnostic technologies provide encouraging opportunities for early diagnosis and intervention. This article evaluates the performance of four machine learning algorithms-AdaBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost-in predicting heart disease across two classes: normal (0) and abnormal (1). The models were assessed based on precision, recall, and F1-score to determine their effectiveness. For class 0, LightGBM achieved the highest F1-score (0.89), with a precision of 0.93 and recall of 0.85, indicating a strong balance between precision and recall. In class 1, AdaBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM all achieved an F1-score of 0.9, with LightGBM demonstrating higher recall (0.94) and strong overall performance. AdaBoost excelled in recall for class 1 (0.96), while CatBoost had the lowest F1-scores across both classes. The results suggest that LightGBM is the most robust model for heart disease prediction, consistently delivering high precision and recall, making it an effective algorithm for this application.

AB  - Breast tumor detection and classification on the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) can be automated with the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Deep learning models rely on large datasets, however, challenges arise when dealing with sensitive medical data. Restrictions on sharing these medical data result in limited publicly available datasets thereby impacting the performance of the deep learning models. To address this issue, we propose an approach that combines different magnification factors of histopathological images using a residual network and information fusion in Federated Learning (FL). FL is employed to preserve the privacy of patient data, while enabling the creation of a global model. Using the BreakHis dataset, we compare the performance of FL with centralized learning (CL). We also performed visualizations for explainable AI. The final models obtained become available for deployment on internal IoMT systems in healthcare institutions for timely diagnosis and treatment. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing works in the literature on multiple metrics.

AB  - Summary <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) and imaging techniques have recently emerged as effective tools for analyzing and understanding visual data. The combination of cognitive algorithms and image processing tools is very effective in object recognition, image segmentation, image enhancement and other applications. This chapter delves into the integration of artificial intelligence and imaging and highlights key techniques and applications along the way. Working together, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and other image&#x2010;processing algorithms can provide a comprehensive framework for solving vision problems. Object recognition is one of the main areas where artificial intelligence has made great strides in imaging. Using deep learning techniques and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), AI machines can learn from large amounts of data and identify objects in high&#x2010;quality images. This includes medical diagnostics, surveillance and driverless vehicles, etc. Additionally, AI methods can improve image segmentation, allowing for more accurate identification of objects and areas of interest in images. Feature extraction is another important application of artificial intelligence. Deep learning models enable AI systems to extract valuable insights from images. This opens the door to many new AI applications, including facial recognition, sentiment analysis, and content&#x2010;based image acquisition. These resources have revolutionized many industries, including advertising, online marketing, and safety and security. This study also explores how AI can achieve different imaging modalities. Image restoration algorithms that are powered by AI, for instance, can improve image quality by removing noise, artefacts, and blurring from photos. With the use of AI, super&#x2010;resolution techniques can be used to create high&#x2010;resolution outputs from lower&#x2010;resolution inputs. These approaches find uses in satellite imaging, medical diagnostics, and surveillance. Moreover, AI methods may offer artistic transformations and style transfer, which enables users to apply the style of a particular piece of artwork or photograph to their photographs. This is made possible because AI methods can provide artistic transformations and style transfer. This has become increasingly popular in the realm of digital media and entertainment because it enables people to produce content that is both aesthetically pleasing and unique to themselves. The chapter covers questions regarding the interpretability of judgements generated by AI, privacy implications of Image analysis, and bias in AI models. It emphasizes the necessity of rigorous data collecting, transparent algorithmic design, and fairness in AI systems to assure unbiased and accountable outputs. In conclusion, this chapter illustrates the substantial impact that may be achieved by integrating approaches of AI with image processing.</p>

AB  - The study presents a new approach to identifying cardiomegaly using advanced convolutional neural networks, more specifically, MobileNet and VGG architectures, with interpretative feature maps. Cardiomegaly, or an enlarged heart, is an important sign of particular cardiovascular disorders. Consistently, this topic is an early finding in individual x-ray projection, and because of the general precision of classical methods, innovative deep learning algorithms are needed. In the first stage, the MobileNet and VGG models are designed on distinct heart photo galleries used to cardiac image classification. Systems are seen throughout the domain as vital utilities designed for photo classification. Ultimately, to simplify the solution, an interpreted feature map is employed. Therefore, the technique becomes more reliable, and the design presents a quantitative statement of whether the accessible results say anything concerning the causes of the cardiomegaly estimates. This research has been extensively tested with datasets and produces better results than the existing methods. The presented model grammar map is interpretable, which aids in the medical professional’s comprehension of the model’s prioritizes and boosts their self-assurance in the diagnostic procedure. Furthermore, the novel approach is versatile with various imaging modalities and patient populace, which suggests extensive practical plays. With the help of an interpretable feature map and the combined usage of VGG appearances and MobileNet advantages, this work complements to the field of substantiation the identification of cardiomegaly. As a final point, the introduced model acquires an excellent amount of truthfulness and resolves a serious predicament of interpretability. Thus, it satisfies the growing stress on lucidness and dependability of deep learning applications in medical substantiation.

AB  - Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD) have remained the primary cause of death worldwide despite the multiple endeavors to design-based evidence models. Although these models are datadriven, they capture first-order relationships between complex and different co-variants. Lately, many Machine Learning (ML) models have been introduced to improve these linear approximations, but their limitations lie in their lack of interpretability. This study proposes a strategy to enhance the interpretability of ML models when predicting CVD risk. Using the longitudinal data from the Framingham Heart Study, ELI5, SHAP, and LIME techniques are separately implemented for men and women using models such as Logistic Regression (LR) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). This framework combines global and local interpretable methods to explain the importance of various risk factors, providing clinicians with a robust tool to make informed decisions and improve CVD risk management. Concluding findings highlight systolic blood pressure as the most important CVD risk factor while metabolic-related factors such as BMI show notable sex-specific differences. Interestingly, risk factors like smoking and diabetes show variable importance suggesting they affect individuals differently and may require segmented analysis. This research underscores the critical role of model explainability in clinical settings and offers a comprehensive approach to integrating ML models into healthcare practices.

AB  - Lung cancer is one of the most prevalent and deadly cancer kinds. CT scan imaging has made it easier to observe in-depth at different lung cancer conditions. Convolutional Neural Networks have already been utilized for detecting objects in images. This research implements a lightweight CNN architecture in classifying two types of cancerous images and distinguishing them from healthy ones. AlexNet, ResNet101 V2, DenseNet201, MobileNet V2, and other sizable deep learning and transfer learning models were tested against this unique architecture with global max pooling. The proposed CNN model overlaps in performance with much bigger models whilst using about eight times fewer parameters, thus being efficient. Apart from making the architecture smaller, Grad-CAM was used to explain the convolutional flow over different convolution layers. This integration of the Grad-CAM technique into the analysis adds a crucial layer of transparency to the deep-learning models. By vi-sualizing the regions within lung cancer images that significantly influence predictions, we aim to enhance the interpretability of our model, fostering trust and better understanding among healthcare professionals.

AB  - Tuberculosis remains a big global health challenge, especially in areas with a lack of high-tech medical diagnostics. This study proposes a hybrid deep learning model for TB detection using chest X-ray images and associated radiological reports via a built model that combines CNNs, ANNs, and RNNs. It leverages strengths of CNNs in extracting spatial features from images, ANNs for the representation of complex relationships, and RNNs for processing sequential text data from reports. We use a diverse dataset comprising 2,800 TB-positive X-rays, 3,500 normal ones, and 700 publicly available ones to ensure robustness and generalization. The performance for the proposed model reached 97 precent with a precision of 0.85, recall of 0.90, and F1-score of 0.88 in the most challenging cases. The authors have also used the Grad-CAM technique to visualize important areas on the X-rays responsible for the TB diagnosis to enhance interpretability. Because of the model's capability of integrating image and textual data, it can detect TB very early with high precision, hence making it a good tool to deploy, particularly in settings where resources are limited and timely intervention is very important.

AB  - The advent of healthcare 4.0 has catalyzed a paradigm shift in medical practices, ushering in innovative approaches such as telesurgery, a groundbreaking method for remote patient surgery and monitoring. This transformative technique extends beyond traditional surgeries, finding application in dermatological procedures. The success of telesurgery in skin-related surgeries hinges on accurate and efficient skin cancer detection using dermoscopic images. Recognizing the inherent complexities in interpreting deep learning models, especially in the context of healthcare, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (X-AI) becomes imperative. In this context, we propose a novel CNN-powered X-AI mechanism i.e., X-CaD, tailored for skin cancer detection in telesurgery environments, leveraging ResNet and MobileNet for feature extraction. To enhance interpretability and bridge the gap between model predictions and clinical decision-making, we employ X-AI techniques such as Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and Integrated Gradient (IG). LIME provides granular insights into model predictions, elucidating decision-making processes, while IG offers a comprehensive view of feature attributions. X-CaD relies on the synergistic integration of advanced CNN architectures, i.e. ResNet and MobileNet along with X-AI techniques to identify skin cancer accurately and provide clinicians with clear insights. The effective impact of X-CaD is evaluated through the observed loss and accuracy values for the DL models, and heat map outputs for X-AI. This represents a significant advancement in the integration of state-of-the-art technology and healthcare, offering a dependable telesurgery solution for the diagnosis of skin cancer in surgical procedures.

AB  - A remarkable increase in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is in public health nowadays. Timely diagnosis is crucial for the proper treatment of this illness. This work introduces a deep learning model capable of properly predicting the early stages of the disease. The evaluated models are: Deep Belief Network (DBN), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and the proposed innovative method, CNN+DBN model. Our study compares three models under two conditions: without hyperparameter tuning and with hyperparameter adjustment. After doing hyperparameter tuning on a chronic kidney disease dataset, the model attained an accuracy of 99.2%. This accuracy is significantly higher accuracy as compared to other researchers. The DBN model demonstrates superior performance compared to other models regarding accuracy, recall, F1 score, AUC, and precision. This study introduces a CNN-based model that integrates the deep learning capabilities of the DBN with the feature extraction strengths of the CNN. It effectively captures spatial dependencies in the collected data. The extracted features enable the model to process and predict the early stages of kidney disease. The combination of the CNN and DBN models demonstrated high accuracy. Hyperparameter tuning improves accuracy to 98.15%, exceeding the performance of GRU+DBN models. The CNN+DBN model processes this data further. The hyperparameter tuning and the combined model attained an accuracy of 98.15%, surpassing the performance of the GRU+DBN models. The interpretability and performance of deep learning models are critical factors in the development of efficient models. The inherent nature of the system allows healthcare professionals to rely on its predictions. Additionally, hyperparameter tuning enhances the performance of the model. The robustness of the applied model is evident.

AB  - Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is aimed for enhancing transparency, accountability, and trustworthiness of computer systems, which is especially important for the healthcare domain to respect applicable regulations and build trust among users. However, majority of the state-of-the-art XAI methods are suited for the supervised learning task, whereas in real-world applications, adequate collection of labelled examples is either costly or non-feasible. To overcome this limit and broaden the applicability of XAI to unlabelled samples, we propose a novel approach that exploits the unsupervised prototype-based learning to uncover the hidden structure of data and apply these prototypes for explaining emerging patterns. This primary idea is accomplished, in the proposed workflow, by combining two prototype-based algorithms, namely Non-negative Matrix Factorization, and Fuzzy C-Means, with the Shapley Additive Explanations to derive graphical explanations of the extracted prototypes. The proposed approach is validated for real-life data related to the sensor-based monitoring of mental health.

AB  - Accurately predicting the needs for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU) at an early stage is crucial as it helps improve patient outcomes and optimize medical resource use. However, this task is challenging because of diverse medical data types, complex data correlations, missing values, and imbalanced prediction classes. In this study, we propose a novel ensemble learning approach that combines traditional machine learning models and deep learning models to achieve superior prediction performance in predicting IMV needs. Applied to 30,313 valid ICU stays filtered from the publicly available MIMIC-IV database, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.94 in predicting IMV needs for ICU patients within six hours following their initial four-hour ICU stays. This surpasses the highest AUC of 0.935 reported in previous studies and sets a new benchmark for early prediction of IMV needs. This approach uses traditional machine learning models to capture relationships in static features and deep learning models to capture temporal dependencies in longitudinal features. Then their predictions are combined to produce the final predictions. Additionally, the feature importance analysis enhances interpretability by identifying the most influential features for predicting IMV needs, making the predictions transparent and actionable. By using static and longitudinal features routinely collected from ICU patients, our approach is both practical and highly extensible, readily adaptable to other electronic health record (EHR) databases and other clinical prediction tasks.

AB  - Different urinary tract conditions often exhibit overlapping symptoms such as a strong urge to urinate, burning sensations, abnormal urine output and fever, making diagnosis and treatment challenging and time-consuming. Traditional diagnostic methods are slow, leading to delays in treatment. Additionally, a significant issue with AI models is their black-box nature. Thus, this study developed dependable AI machine learning models to predict two urinary system diseases: acute nephritis of the renal pelvis (ANRP) and inflammation of the urinary bladder (IUB). This paper compared twelve machine learning techniques. To address the data imbalance the support vector machine synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SVMSMOTE) is employed. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) values are used to address the black-box nature for interpretability. SHAP tools are employed to demystify the models, providing transparency and identifying key features influencing predictions. This approach ensures the ethical adoption in healthcare by addressing transparency, casuality and interpretability in diagnosis. The results demonstrate performance of 100% across accuracy, precision, recall, and fl- score for SVM, KNN, voting and stacking model, with KNN excelling in training time. SHAP analysis provided valuable insights, making our models clinically relevant.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) generic phrase used to describe heart or blood vessel illness. Conditions that impact the body’s, brain’s, or heart’s blood flow. Reduced blood flow can result from factors such as blood clots, leading to heart attack, angina, or stroke. Other potential meanings of CVD. These models offer key benefits like clear interpretability and the ability to analyze complex patterns, significantly enhancing the accuracy of cardiovascular disease risk predictions. The demerits of using SVM, LR, K-NN, and MLP for CVD prediction include inter-pretability issues, overfitting risks, data requirements, feature selection challenges, scalability concerns, algorithm complexity, and class imbalance. Collaboration between machine learning experts and healthcare professionals is essential for developing accurate and reliable CVD prediction models that enhance patient care. CVD is a significant health threat, often leading to fatal complications. Early detection is crucial for effective intervention. This study employs SVM (accuracy is 0.84%), LR (accuracy is 0.86%), K-NN (accuracy is 0.94%), and MLP (accuracy is 0.79%) machine learning techniques to enhance CVD detection by addressing outliers and null values, contributing to advancing automatic detection initiatives.

AB  - Radiomics, which involves extracting quantitative features from medical images, enhances cancer diagnosis, prog-nosis, and treatment prediction. However, a significant challenge is the interpretability of machine learning models, often seen as “black boxes,” hindering clinical application and regulatory approval. We propose a new workflow building on existing algorithms to develop interpretable models using radiomic features from MRI scans of brain metastases. We used the Yale New Haven Database of 195 patients with brain metastases was used. Radiomic features were extracted using the Py Radiomics library and preprocessed to remove low variance and highly correlated features. Models including linear regression, XGBoost, SVR, and elastic net were developed. Model interpretability was assessed using Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) iterated over 1000 runs. The XGBoost model demonstrated su-perior performance, achieving an RMSE of 0.16, R2 of 0.34, and MAE of 0.12 for necrosis-tumor ratio prediction. LIME identified entropy differences, gray level features, and dependence variance radiomic features from the original filter to influence model predictions the most. The use of LIME on bootstrapped samples for model interpretability aids in clinical application, providing insights into significant radiomic features. Model interpretability and transparency in predictions will pave the way for trustworthy models and enhance acceptance.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is the bedrock of management systems and will continue to support human society both now and in the future. These systems’ decision-making processes must be transparent, especially in sensitive areas such as autonomous driving and healthcare, to build trust. Although methods exist for achieving algorithmic transparency, there are no well-established design techniques to systematically address descriptive issues when reviewing AI. In response, we introduce the Explainability in Design (EID) approach, which operationalizes the definition of AI into six fundamental concepts. EID was refined through iterative empirical studies, including applied learning and interviews with practitioners. An empirical study with AI system designers tested the utility of EID, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing barriers to integrating explanatory functionality in AI systems and enhancing decision-making processes.

AB  - It is critical to make a timely diagnosis of liver disease to avoid fatal health complications. The use of AI-based diagnosis systems can help in the early detection of such liver diseases based on health parameters. However, the use of such systems is not yet widely accepted by medical practitioners due to their complex nature and inability to comprehend the rationale behind the outcomes. In this research article, we attempted to identify the relationship between interpretability and accuracy in machine learning models applied for diagnosing liver disease using a variety of models, such as Logistic Regression, KNN, decision tree, XGBoost, and random forest. We performed a thorough evaluation of a dataset of liver patients and analyzed traditional performance metrics, such as accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score, to provide a thorough insight into the diagnostic capabilities of each model. Moreover, we use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to decipher the underlying characteristics that propel the predictions of the models. The goal of this interpretability analysis is to clarify the decision-making process and provide important clinical practitioner insights. By carefully analyzing interpretability and accuracy, we hope to uncover possible trade-offs and offer insightful advice for using these models in actual healthcare environments. This work has immediate implications for clinical practice in addition to adding to the growing body of knowledge in medical diagnostics and machine learning. The information provided here aims to improve patient care and outcomes by strengthening the validity and efficacy of liver disease diagnosis.

AB  - The transformation of communication media has revolutionized social interactions, incorporating audio and video into our lives. Despite the recent availability of virtual reality (VR) technology, its widespread adoption faces obstacles. Technological challenges in creating VR environments and scientific confounding concerning interindividual variability in responses to virtual simulations are key factors hindering its broader integration. The EXPERIENCE project makes real the complex interplay among multisensory perception, emotional responses, and extended social interactions by allowing the public-at-large to create their own VR environments automatically through portable devices (e.g., smartphones/tablets) without the need for technical skills. The VR environment augmented by an individual’s physiological responses, psychological and cognitive descriptors, and behavioral outcomes defines the individual’s subjective experience, namely, an individual’s extended personal reality (EPR). The virtualization of a person’s EPR provides a holistic and quantitative environment that can be shared with others to transfer personalized psychological and emotional responses. Additionally, EPR assessment enables subsequent manipulation of the VR through explainable artificial intelligence (AI) routines merging multisensory biofeedback, individualized perception of time-space, and neuromodulation. This technology can be exploited in a plethora of innovative scenarios, including mental healthcare, gaming, e-learning, and neuroeconomics, also leading to the creation of a new market for sharing and selling (virtual) experiences.

AB  - The application of machine learning in the medical field has been a burgeoning area of research over the past decade. However, a significant challenge lies in the interpretability of disease prediction models. This study proposes a novel disease prediction model based on Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN), aiming to provide a new approach to an interpretable model architecture. KAN is a novel neural network architecture that extends the network derived from the Kolmogorov-Arnold rep-resentation theorem, enhancing the transparency and reliability of the model by constructing an interpretable network structure. This paper first introduces the theoretical foundation of KAN and its network design principles. It then validates the model's effectiveness in various disease prediction tasks through a comprehen-sive series of experiments and conducts a comparative analysis with existing machine learning models. The experimental results demonstrate improvements in various performance metrics, such as accuracy, average precision, aera under ROC, area under PR curve, compared to traditional models. Importantly, KAN enhances the model's transparency, enabling medical experts to comprehend the logic behind the predictions. This interpretability is crucial for clinical decision-making, as it allows healthcare professionals to understand the reasoning behind the model's outputs and make informed decisions based on the provided insights.

AB  - Recent global estimates suggest that as many as 2.41 billion individuals have health conditions that would benefit from rehabilitation services. Home-based Physical Therapy (PT), faces significant challenges in providing interactive feedback and meaningful observation for therapists and patients. To fill this gap, we present MicroXercise, which integrates micro-motion analysis with wearable sensors, providing therapists and patients with a comprehensive feedback interface, including video, text, and scores. Crucially, it employs multi-dimensional Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and attribution-based explainable methods to analyze the existing deep learning neural networks in monitoring exercises, focusing on a high granularity of exercise. This synergistic approach is pivotal, providing output matching the input size to precisely highlight critical subtleties and movements in PT, thus transforming complex AI analysis into clear, actionable feedback. By highlighting these micro-motions in different metrics, such as stability and range of motion, MicroX-ercise significantly enhances the understanding and relevance of feedback for end-users. Comparative performance metrics underscore its effectiveness over traditional methods, such as a 39% and 42% improvement in Feature Mutual Information (FMI) and Continuity. MicroXercise is a step ahead in home-based physical therapy, providing a technologically advanced and intuitively helpful solution to enhance patient care and outcomes.

AB  - The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in healthcare has led to an abundance of patient data from diverse sources [1]. This study explores the application of ensemble methods to leverage multiple IoT data sources for health predictions. We propose a hybrid ensemble framework that combines data from wearable devices, smart home sensors, and clinical IoT equipment. Our approach utilizes a combination of traditional machine learning models and deep learn1ing techniques to create a predictive model [2]. The study was conducted on a dataset of 10,000 patients over a 12-month period, focusing on predicting the onset of chronic conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Results demonstrate that our hybrid ensemble method achieves a statistically significant improvement in prediction accuracy compared to single-source models, with an F1 score of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.87-0.91, p < 0.001). We also introduce a new interpretability metric for ensemble models and demonstrate a 30% improvement in model explainability. These findings suggest that our approach can enhance the reliability and interpretability of health predictions in IoT-enabled healthcare systems, potentially leading to more timely interventions and improved patient outcomes [3].

AB  - Machine Learning (ML) models are frequently developed for application in the healthcare domain, particularly to support clinical decision-making. Despite their potential utility, their effective application in real-world scenarios remains quite limited. This apparent contradiction is primarily due to a significant lack of trust, since ML models are often "black box" systems, which may be critical in clinical decision with significant impact on users.To address this problem, trust assessment is proposed at two distinct levels: i) global (ML model) evaluation; ii) individual (instance) assessment.Global assessment is based on three different parameters: i) model robustness (stability assessment); ii) confidence (95% CI of geometric mean of the model); iii) interpretability (comparison of respective features ranking with clinical evidence). Naturally, the global performance of the model has also to be considered.The individual (pointwise) evaluation is based on a metric of reliability applied in the prediction of a specific instance.The proposed strategy was applied to cardiovascular disease context. A dataset of patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) was used for validation. This dataset includes N=1544 patients and was provided by a Portuguese hospital.The obtained results suggest that global trust assessment can be successfully implemented, enhancing physicians' trust in a specific model. Meanwhile, individual assessment demonstrates the ability to distinguish between reliable and unreliable predictions (instance level). The potential combination of these two complementary perspectives could be a valuable tool in the support to clinical decision.

AB  - Monkeypox, a rare viral illness predominantly found in Central and West Africa, presents significant public health concerns. Detecting and predicting monkeypox outbreaks early is essential for effective disease management. In this study, we propose a new method for predicting monkeypox using Biogeography-Based Optimization (BBO) alongside machine learning techniques. We used clinical features and demographic data dataset to train and evaluate our predictive model. BBO was employed to select the most relevant subset of features from the dataset, improving the model’s performance. Our findings demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, achieving high accuracy in predicting monkeypox outbreaks. Moreover, we emphasize the importance of feature selection in enhancing the interpretability and applicability of predictive models for infectious diseases. This research contributes to advancing predictive analytics in epidemiology and offers valuable insights for disease surveillance and public health interventions.

AB  - Large-scale analyses of omics data are crucial for advancing precision medicine and personalised treatments. Current methods to unravel cancer development and prognosis exhibit a dichotomy between interpretability and representational power. Most either rely on post-hoc interpretability techniques with black-box models or use linear models that might miss complex biological interactions. We propose a novel configurable prior-knowledge-based deep auto-encoding framework called PAAE and its generative variant PAVAE, for analyzing cancer RNA-seq data. Our method constrains its learned internal representation with biological pathways, providing interpretability without sacrificing predictive power. Our model is tested on 3 different downstream tasks: cancer subtype classification, survival analysis and unsupervised clustering of the learned features. Our models outperform baselines while having orders of magnitude less parameters than naive models. Extensive interpretability analyses, including task-relevant feature identification demonstrate our model’s effectiveness at identifying underlying biological signals in an unsupervised fashion. Visualisations are used to highlight the intrinsic interpretability of our models. The source code of this study is available at github.com/phcavelar/pathwayae

AB  - Medical image analysis (MedIA) has become an essential tool in medicine and healthcare, aiding in disease diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning, and recent successes in deep learning (DL) have made significant contributions to its advances. However, deploying DL models for MedIA in real-world situations remains challenging due to their failure to generalize across the distributional gap between training and testing samples—a problem known as domain shift. Researchers have dedicated their efforts to developing various DL methods to adapt and perform robustly on unknown and out-of-distribution (OOD) data distributions. This article comprehensively reviews domain generalization (DG) studies specifically tailored for MedIA. We provide a holistic view of how DG techniques interact within the broader MedIA system, going beyond methodologies to consider the operational implications on the entire MedIA workflow. Specifically, we categorize DG methods into data-level, feature-level, model-level, and analysis-level methods. We show how those methods can be used in various stages of the MedIA workflow with DL equipped from data acquisition to model prediction and analysis. Furthermore, we critically analyze the strengths and weaknesses of various methods, unveiling future research opportunities.

AB  - Stroke is one dangerous illness that kills people. Stroke is so called because of the way it strikes people down. Across the globe, it is among the main causes of mortality and disability. It requires early identification and precise measures to be taken in order to prevent stroke and further damages to the brain and other parts of body. Our study investigates the use of machine learning techniques that includes Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Free Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Naive Bares and multiple Boosting Classifiers. The “Healthcare Dataset Stroke Data” is the dataset used, which is preprocessed and then trained upon by Ml. models. For Random Forest Classifier, the maximum accuracy observed was 94.91%, and upon Hyper parameter Tuning- there was rise in accuracy to 95.64%, Evaluation criteria like F1-score, precision, and recall provides additional evidence for the effectiveness of these models: Further in order to explain how each feature contributes differently to each prediction we have made use of two popular techniques for XAT, LIME and SHAP. LIVE and SHIP provides local, interpretable explanations and global explanations respectively.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) adoption is growing rapidly across sectors, yet significant barriers hinder its acceptance in Indian government social welfare schemes. This research investigates factors influencing AI adoption using a mixed-methods approach, including the Delphi method with 13 experts and a survey of 146 respondents. The study identifies five key themes from a systematic literature review: social environment, organizational issues, technology-related issues, technology ecosystem, and individual factors. Concerns highlighted include data privacy, security vulnerabilities, trust in AI’s transparency, and a perceived lack of accountability in AI decision-making amongst others.Despite these concerns, the study reveals areas where respondents are comfortable using AI, particularly in healthcare, finance, and customer service sectors, suggesting a conditional acceptance based on context. The findings emphasize that addressing both technological and human factors— such as trust, security, and transparency is critical for fostering AI acceptance in Social Welfare schemes by Governments in India.By addressing these barriers and leveraging areas of comfort, policymakers can promote AI integration in social welfare schemes. This research contributes to existing literature by offering insights into user perceptions, with implications for theory, practice, and policy. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies to track shifts in public attitudes as AI technologies evolve.

AB  - Ensemble models such as gradient boosting and random forests are proven to offer the best predictive performance on a wide variety of supervised learning problems. The high performance of these black box models, however, comes at a cost of model interpretability. They are also inadequate to meet regulatory demands and explainability needs of organizations. The model interpretability in high performance black-box models is achieved with the help of post-hoc explainable models such as Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). This paper presents an alternate intrinsic classifier model that extracts a class of higher order patterns and embeds them into an interpretable learning model. More specifically, the proposed model extracts novel High Utility Gain (HUG) patterns that capture higher order interactions, transforms the model input data into a new space, and applies interpretable classifier methods on the transformed space. We conduct rigorous experiments on forty benchmark binary and multi-class classification datasets to evaluate the proposed model against the state-of-the-art ensemble and interpretable classifier models. The proposed model was comprehensively assessed on three key dimensions: 1) quality of predictions using classifier measures such as accuracy,  $F_{1}$ , AUC, H-measure, and logistic loss, 2) computational performance on large and high-dimensional data, and 3) interpretability aspects. The HUG-based learning model was found to deliver performance comparable to that of the state-of-the-art ensemble models. Our model was also found to achieve 2-40% (45%) prediction quality (interpretability) improvements with significantly lower computational requirements over other interpretable classifier models. Furthermore, we present case studies in finance and healthcare domains and generate one- and two-dimensional HUG profiles to illustrate the interpretability aspects of our HUG models. The proposed solution offers an alternate approach to build high performance and transparent machine learning classifier models. We hope that our ML solution help organizations meet their growing regulatory and explainability needs.

AB  - One paradigm for machine learning that is transforming is reinforcement learning, or RL, promising significant healthcare improvements through personalized treatment recommendations, optimized resource allocation, and enhanced predictive modeling. Despite these successes, challenges such as model interpretability and real-world integration persist. This paper reviews various optimization techniques employed in RL, focusing on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) due to its stability, efficiency, and applicability in healthcare. Applications of PPO include adaptive treatment strategies, personalized medication management, and optimized clinical workflows. Additionally, the paper discusses case studies demonstrating RL’s potential to reduce medication errors, enhance treatment protocols, predict adverse events, and personalize radiation therapy. A comprehensive database search initially retrieved 708 articles; after removing duplicates and screening based on titles and abstracts, 23 articles were considered, ultimately narrowing down to 15 articles following the application of exclusion criteria. The findings demonstrate RL’s significant impact on healthcare, enhancing treatment effectiveness, optimizing service selection, and improving patient care through advanced techniques like Deep RL and multi-agent systems. Future research should focus on developing sophisticated adaptive treatment models and validating RL applications through clinical trials, underscoring RL’s potential to revolutionize healthcare by making it more effective, efficient, and patient centric.

AB  - Fairness of machine learning models in healthcare has drawn increasing attention from clinicians, researchers, and even at the highest level of government. On the other hand, the importance of developing and deploying interpretable or explainable models has been demonstrated, and is essential to increasing the trustworthiness and likelihood of adoption of these models. The objective of this study was to develop and implement a framework for addressing both these issues - fairness and explainability. We propose an explainable fairness framework, first developing a model with optimized performance, and then using an in-processing approach to mitigate model biases relative to the sensitive attributes of race and sex. We then explore and visualize explanations of the model changes that lead to the fairness enhancement process through exploring the changes in importance of features. Our resulting-fairness enhanced models retain high sensitivity with improved fairness and explanations of the fairness-enhancement that may provide helpful insights for healthcare providers to guide clinical decision-making and resource allocation.

AB  - Cloud computing and deep learning are changing decision-support systems. This combination was driven by cloud computing and deep learning models’ complimentary data processing capabilities. Traditional decision-support systems typically fail due to the complexity and variety of current information, particularly unstructured and semi-structured data. Innovative methods are required to overcome this restriction and exploit big data’s immense potential. Cloud computing is essential for handling and storing huge amounts of data because to its design, scalability, and storage capacity. Company data is securely accessed, processed, and stored while being cost-effective and flexible. Deep learning models—a subset of AI—offer a great toolbox of neural networks and algorithms for analyzing complex data patterns. These models are versatile, train well, and can find patterns in unstructured data. However, ideal outcomes demand a lot of processing power. Deep learning and cloud computing operate together better than traditional decision-support systems. Instead of static, rule-based models, the decision-support system may now react to complicated, ever-changing data. Modern cloud-based algorithms enable organizations to make accurate, personalized choices in real time. These changes will affect healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and autonomous automobiles. Convergence causes actual concerns. Data security, privacy, and equality are key concerns. Cloud systems are difficult to balance between usability and safety. Since deep learning algorithms may be prejudiced and provide unfair outcomes, we must continue to promote fairness and transparency. Additional challenges to the effective implementation of these converged systems include controlling scalability, ensuring compliance with laws, and addressing interoperability.

AB  - Shortcut learning in deep learning models occurs when unintended features are prioritized, resulting in degenerated feature representations and reduced generalizability and interpretability. However, shortcut learning in the widely used vision transformer (ViT) framework is largely unknown. Meanwhile, introducing domain-specific knowledge is a major approach to rectifying the shortcuts that are predominated by background-related factors. For example, eye-gaze data from radiologists are effective human visual prior knowledge that has the great potential to guide the deep learning models to focus on meaningful foreground regions. However, obtaining eye-gaze data can still sometimes be time-consuming, labor-intensive, and even impractical. In this work, we propose a novel and effective saliency-guided ViT (SGT) model to rectify shortcut learning in ViT with the absence of eye-gaze data. Specifically, a computational visual saliency model (either pretrained or fine-tuned) is adopted to predict saliency maps for input image samples. Then, the saliency maps are used to filter the most informative image patches. Considering that this filter operation may lead to global information loss, we further introduce a residual connection that calculates the self-attention across all the image patches. The experiment results on natural and medical image datasets show that our SGT framework can effectively learn and leverage human prior knowledge without eye-gaze data and achieves much better performance than baselines. Meanwhile, it successfully rectifies the harmful shortcut learning and significantly improves the interpretability of the ViT model, demonstrating the promise of transferring human prior knowledge derived visual saliency in rectifying shortcut learning.

AB  - Human activity classification has emerged as a pivotal area of research within the field of deep learning, driven by its manifold applications spanning from healthcare to surveillance and human- computer interaction. This review paper provides an extensive examination of recent advancements in human activity classification utilizing deep learning techniques, shedding light on current challenges and promising future directions. We present a thorough analysis of the key components within the Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and attention mechanisms are examples of deep learning paradigms that have significantly contributed to the accuracy and robustness of human activity classification models. The utilization of multi-modal data sources, including sensor data and image sequences, is explored, emphasizing the fusion of information from diverse sensors to enhance classification performance. Addressing the perennial challenge of data scarcity, we discuss the evolution of semi- supervised learning and transfer learning methods as strategies to maximize model generalization using limited labeled data. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of the ever-growing datasets and benchmark standards on the advancement of this field, enabling fair comparisons and benchmarking of models. This study also provides insights into ongoing research on real-time human activity recognition, where deep learning models are applied to interactive systems and robotics. The potential for enhancing interpretability and model explainability is explored, paving the way for more transparent and accountable AI systems in this context. Finally, this study highlights the significance of ethical considerations and privacy concerns in the development and deployment of human activity classification models and propose guidelines for responsible AI in this domain. This comprehensive review serves as a reference point for development and deployment of human activity classification models and propose guidelines for responsible AI in this domain.

AB  - In the United States, heart disease is the leading cause of death, killing about 695,000 people each year. Myocardial infarction (MI) is a cardiac complication which occurs when blood flow to a portion of the heart decreases or halts, leading to damage in the heart muscle. Heart failure and Atrial fibrillation (AF) are closely associated with MI. Heart failure is a common complication of MI and a risk factor for AF. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning techniques have shown potential in predicting cardiovascular conditions. However, developing a simplified predictive model, along with a thorough feature analysis, is challenging due to various factors, including lifestyle, age, family history, medical conditions, and clinical variables for cardiac complications prediction. This paper aims to develop simplified models with comprehensive feature analysis and data preprocessing for predicting cardiac complications, such as heart failure and atrial fibrillation linked with MI, using a publicly available dataset of myocardial infarction patients. This will help the students and health care professionals understand various factors responsible for cardiac complications through a simplified workflow. By prioritizing interpretability, this paper illustrates how simpler models, like decision trees and logistic regression, can provide transparent decision-making processes while still maintaining a balance with accuracy. Additionally, this paper examines how age-specific factors affect heart failure and atrial fibrillation conditions. Overall this research focuses on making machine learning accessible and interpretable. Its goal is to equip students and non-experts with practical tools to understand how ML can be applied in healthcare, particularly for the cardiac complications prediction for patients having MI.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods are becoming essential in healthcare. In the context of Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT), Knowledge-Based Planning (KBP) methodologies have enabled the modification of treatments in real-time to accommodate morphological changes in patients. KBP for IMRT is a data-driven approach that utilises real-time medical imaging to adjust the radiation dose for a patient as needed for the different stages of an illness. In this work we present an interpretable AI model that selects the best IMRT treatment alternatives and determines which is the best. We use an Adaptive Neuforuzzy Adaptive Inference System (ANFIS), which combines the potential of a neural network with the interpretability of a rule based system. We train the model in a supervised manner using the OpenKBP challenge data repository. For this purpose, we also developed a data augmentation method that is supported by Diffusion Probabilistic Models. This approach enables the generation of a wider spectrum of treatment qualities and aids regularisation. The primary advantage of this framework resides in its ability to offer explanations, which is essential in the deployment of medical procedures in real life. Moreover, it serves as a valuable means to test hypotheses concerning the quality of IMRT treatments. Our study reveals that the developed tool has substantial potential to establish itself as a reference in the realm of explainable IMRT treatment selection tools.

AB  - Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) form the foundation of critical infrastructures, integrating computing, networking, and physical processes across sectors such as energy, healthcare, and manufacturing. As CPS become increasingly interconnected, they face sophisticated cyber threats that challenge traditional security measures. This systematic review explores next-generation cybersecurity solutions designed to protect CPS, focusing on emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), blockchain, quantum-resistant cryptography, and federated learning (FL). We conducted a comprehensive literature search across IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Web of Science, to identify studies published between 2010 and 2024. The review covers studies that examine the role of AI in anomaly detection and automated threat responses, blockchain for decentralized communication and identity management, and quantum-resistant cryptographic techniques as a safeguard against future quantum-enabled attacks. Federated learning, which enables collaborative learning across CPS devices while preserving data privacy, is also evaluated for its distributed security applications. The findings indicate that while AI enhances real-time security, it remains vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Blockchain offers robust security but faces scalability challenges, and federated learning requires stronger safeguards against model poisoning.

AB  - The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has revolutionized healthcare, but its vulnerabilities demand robust security solutions, especially for resource-constrained devices. In this research, we introduce an innovative Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)-based intrusion detection system (IDS) designed specifically for the unique challenges of IoMT, deploying at the edge for enhanced efficiency. Our proposed IDS incorporates a multifaceted approach: first, it leverages the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm for feature engineering, optimizing data representation to reduce computational overhead on resource-constrained devices. Second, a diverse ensemble of machine learning and deep learning models is employed to detect a wide array of intrusion attempts within IoMT networks. Third, interpretation is achieved using Shapley additive explanations (SHAPs), providing transparency and understanding of the decision-making process. By combining intelligence, efficiency, explainability, and deploying as a SaaS solution at the network edge, our IDS not only improves the security of resource-constrained IoMT devices but also empowers healthcare professionals with actionable insights, ensuring patient data privacy and network integrity in this dynamic and critical domain. Finally, the results using a publicly available healthcare data set, namely, WUSTL-EHMS-2020 proves the effectiveness of the proposed IDS over some recent state-of-the-art works.

AB  - Skin lesion segmentation plays a crucial role in the computer-aided diagnosis of melanoma. Deep Learning models have shown promise in accurately segmenting skin lesions, but their widespread adoption in real-life clinical settings is hindered by their inherent black-box nature. In domains as critical as healthcare, interpretability is not merely a feature but a fundamental requirement for model adoption. This paper proposes IARS SegNet an advanced segmentation framework built upon the SegNet baseline model. Our approach incorporates three critical components: Skip connections, residual convolutions, and a global attention mechanism onto the baseline Segnet architecture. These elements play a pivotal role in accentuating the significance of clinically relevant regions, particularly the contours of skin lesions. The inclusion of skip connections enhances the model’s capacity to learn intricate contour details, while the use of residual convolutions allows for the construction of a deeper model while preserving essential image features. The global attention mechanism further contributes by extracting refined feature maps from each convolutional and deconvolutional block, thereby elevating the model’s interpretability. This enhancement highlights critical regions, fosters better understanding, and leads to more accurate skin lesion segmentation for melanoma diagnosis. This study primarily focuses on the interpretation of performance improvements in the base model resulting from the integration of each of these three components. To comprehensively assess the performance gain achieved with each addition, we employ two sets of evaluation metrics, quantifying performance based on both regions and contours. The results underscore the superior segmentation capabilities of the proposed architecture compared to the SegNet and U-Net models. Notably, the model’s performance gain due to each enhancement is visually interpretable.

AB  - Mental stress poses significant health risks, manifesting in various psychological and physical issues such as depression, anxiety, and cardiovascular complications. Establishing a reliable method for swiftly and accurately classifying mental stress levels is crucial due to its widespread impact. Existing classification approaches predominantly rely on either data-intensive traditional machine learning algorithms or opaque deep learning models, hindering real-world use and interpretability. This study addresses these limitations by proposing a novel approach for stress level classification using the WESAD dataset. Our method combines an attention-based ResN et with CBAM. This innovative approach synergistically integrates shallow and deep features, harnessing both low-level details and high-level semantic information to effectively classify stress levels into four distinct states: baseline, stress, amusement, and meditation, or three states excluding the meditation state. The experimental result shows 92.74% accuracy and 91.19% F1 score for the 4-class setup, and 97.58% accuracy and 97.51 % F1 score for the 3-class setup. Our approach offers a more robust and interpretable framework for mental stress classification, with potential applications in health care and stress management.

AB  - Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a vision-related illness in humans that causes retinal degeneration and can eventually lead to blindness. Diabetic retinopathy is one of the main causes of vision impairment globally and a major consequence of diabetes mellitus. Diabetic retinopathy detection in early stage is a must, in order to prevent total blindness. Numerous physical examinations, including visual clarity assessment, pupil dilation, and optical coherence tomography, are used to diagnose diabetic retinopathy; nevertheless, they are time-consuming and affect patients. This research outlines an innovative approach using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for the detection of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR). This study builds a diversified dataset of retinal fundus images in order to detect five phases of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) using a customized deep CNN architecture. After considerable research and parameter fine-tuning, the CNN outperformed existing approaches in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in diagnosing DR stages. This study uses 3 publicly available datasets, previously imbalanced images across 5 classes, was oversampled to new images, resolving the imbalance issue. The suggested CNN architecture attained a testing accuracy of 95.25%, with testing precision, recall, and F1 score values of 96%, 95%, and 95%, respectively, across the three datasets. However, as a black-box model, its operation is difficult to explain, raising worries about the reliability of its results. To address this issue, we employed Gradient-Weighted Class Activation Map (Grad-CAM) for elucidation, which emphasizes significant areas within the photographs. This approach delivers classification results as well as insights, which help medical practitioners make decisions. An interpretability study revealed important visual regions for decision-making. This method not only advances diagnostic systems, but it also shows promise in early DR detection, potentially assisting in timely identification in clinical settings. It underscores the capabilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in medical image processing, offering the prospect of enhanced accuracy in diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening, hence benefiting diabetic patients and diminishing healthcare expenses.

AB  - The heterogeneity of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a challenge for the disease diagnosis and its evolution. In order to monitor the treatment and progression of MS, the segmentation and analysis of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions may offer quantitative evaluation metrics that may be used to compare images across various regions, patients, time points, and institutions. This study targets to provide a comprehensive review of brain MRI studies related to MS disease focusing on lesion segmentation, feature extraction, and Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD). Image segmentation methods were categorized regarding their supervision (i.e., supervised, and unsupervised), as well as their deep learning capability. Image analysis focused on feature extraction methods such as texture, structure, and image characterization. Furthermore, to address the challenges and future directions, enable better management of MS disease as well as offer personalized and precision medicine services in clinical praxis, an integrated CAD framework is proposed encompassing 3D reconstruction, registration and visualization, explainable artificial intelligence (AI) and assessment of disease evolution.

AB  - Fake news has grown to be a significant issue in the present digital era, affecting both public opinion and information accuracy. Creating effective detection models that can distinguish between fake and real information is essential to getting beyond that obstacle. To identify fake news, we conducted an analysis of two well-known ML techniques, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression (LR), in this research. We used an extensive data set having real news stories and their fake equivalents. By means of preprocessing methods including tokenization, stemming, and feature engineering, we derive meaningful information from the raw material. We next used the processed dataset to train SVM and LR classifiers, using different configurations for the detection of fake news. Evaluation measures that calculate the models' efficiency in differentiating between fake and real news include precision, F1-score, recall, and accuracy. Our test results demonstrate the effectiveness of both SVM and LR in identifying fake news, with SVM demonstrating somewhat superior accuracy rates in several cases. LR, however, performs competitively, especially where interpretability and computational efficiency are paramount. We intend to present a new approach to dynamic model updating in the future, in which real time data will be routinely and methodically added to the detection model. By enhancing the capacity of the model to recognize new types of disinformation, this adaptive approach seeks to increase the model's overall relevance and accuracy in real-time identification of fake news.

AB  - Osteoporosis is a prevalent bone disease, diagnosed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) as a gold standard, which is expensive yet limited availability. This research proposes an alternative technique, using knee X-ray images to classify the level of bone mineral density into normal, osteopenia, and osteoporosis. Several state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) architectures were built on top of pre-processed bone images. Additionally, gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) was employed to provide visual interpretability, allowing medical professionals to explore the areas of interest influencing the model’s classification results. Grad-CAM revealed that the model focuses on the epiphysis and metaphysis areas, which align well with clinical guidelines in osteoporosis diagnosis. The best classification performance using only image data to train the DL model was obtained with the VGG19 model incorporating both augmentation and segmentation, achieving an accuracy of 0.63 and an F1-score of 0.60. Above 10% improvement in performance was observed when patient clinical data, i.e., age, gender, and body mass index (BMI), were included as features to train the model together with image-based features. Further enhancement was achieved by implementing a proposed two-step binary classification strategy: the first step classifies normal vs. abnormal cases, and the second step further classifies abnormal cases into osteopenia vs. osteoporosis. This strategy significantly improved the overall classification accuracy to 0.77 and the F1-score to 0.76, with outstanding performance in predicting abnormal cases where types of abnormality were still confused. The proposed method contributes to pre-screening for osteopenia or osteoporosis using traditional radiographs with attention areas highlighted using Grad-CAM.

AB  - The rapidly evolving landscape of medical imaging necessitates innovative approaches to enhance diagnostic accuracy, particularly in liver and tumor segmentation. Current methodologies often grapple with limitations such as the need for extensive labeled datasets and the challenge of generalizing across diverse pathological presentations. Addressing these constraints, this study introduces a novel deep learning model that amalgamates the prowess of $\mathrm{U}-\mathrm{Net}$ architecture, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Monte Carlo Dropout techniques, each contributing uniquely to overcome the existing barriers. Predominantly, the traditional segmentation models are hindered by their dependency on large, annotated datasets, which are not only scarce but also labor-intensive to produce. Further, these models frequently struggle to maintain consistent performance across varying imaging conditions, a pivotal requirement in medical diagnostics. To surmount these challenges, our proposed model employs a fine-tuning methodology using a U-Net architecture pre-trained on extensive medical image datasets like NIH Chest X-ray or MIMIC-CXR. This strategy leverages the pre-existing knowledge within the network, significantly enhancing the model’s ability to discern and adapt to the specific characteristics inherent in liver and tumor images & samples. In a parallel vein, the model harnesses the capabilities of GANs for data augmentation, generating synthetic yet realistic medical images. This innovative use of GANs addresses the issue of dataset variability, equipping the model to generalize more effectively across a spectrum of liver and tumor appearances, ultimately bolstering its robustness. This approach is particularly advantageous in handling cases with diverse lighting, angles, or pathological conditions, traditionally a stumbling block for segmentation models. Moreover, the incorporation of Monte Carlo Dropout for uncertainty estimation marks a significant stride in the realm of clinical applicability. This technique yields pixel-wise uncertainty maps, offering invaluable insights into the model’s confidence levels in its predictions. Such transparency is crucial in clinical settings, where understanding the model’s certainty can guide more informed and cautious decision-making, particularly in scenarios where the cost of erroneous segmentation is high for different scenarios. Empirical evaluation of this composite model on Kaggle datasets has demonstrated its superior performance, evidenced by improvements in precision (3.9%), accuracy (4.9%), recall (4.5%), AUC (8.5%), and a reduction in delay (3.5%) compared to existing methods. The culmination of these advancements not only enhances the efficacy of liver and tumor segmentation but also paves the way for broader applications in medical imaging diagnostics.

AB  - AI models (e.g., machine learning or deep learning models) have become ubiquitous in our everyday life. This led to an ever-increasing complexity of these systems to accommodate various use-cases and domains (e.g., ML for healthcare). As a result, explaining the output of these systems has become crucial in many applications such as ML fairness, and data debugging. Existing explainable AI (XAI) techniques can be categorized into two categories: (1) Model-agnostic approaches (e.g., LIME, Shapley values) that quantify the feature importance for a given prediction. (2) White-box XAI techniques which assume knowledge of the model’s function and parameters (e.g., influence functions) and can quantify the impact of removing individual training points on the model’s parameters without re-training. With the rise in complexity of ML models, tracing their predictions to training data without re-training has become ineffective. As a result, model-agnostic XAI methods have become the de facto methods to explain black-box models. However, there is no model-agnostic approach that can link a prediction made by the model to subsets of the training data that are necessary to produce it. We present CausalExplain, a work-in-progress system that combines adversarial training and causal reasoning to produce the top-k training data subsets that are most responsible for a given prediction made by a black-box model. CausalExplain only interacts with the underlying model through its input-output interface and assumes no knowledge of the model’s function or parameters.

By synergistically harnessing the capabilities of CNNs in extracting spatial features from medic15al images, RNNs in analysing temporal patterns from patient records, and FHNNs in incorporating fuzzy logic for uncertainty handling and interpretability, the proposed methodology aims to achieve unparalleled accuracy and robustness in CKD diagnosis. Additionally, the research introduces a novel evaluation metric, the Renal Impairment Index (RII), amalgamating multiple clinical parameters to provide a comprehensive assessment of CKD severity. Extensive experimentation on diverse datasets validates the efficacy and clinical relevance of the proposed methodology, demonstrating promising performance in early CKD detection &staging.

AB  - This paper is a comparative analysis of medical image diagnosis algorithms with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and other methods; such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and k-nearest Neighbors (k-NN) The study performs evaluations on datasets with multi-modalities like medical images and diagnostic and various imaging modalities. Results shows that CNNs have the upper hand over traditional, static algorithms across several metrics that assesses the performance of the system such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1. In particular, CNN precision was 90.5% while the recall was 93.7%, and the accuracy was 92.1% as well as F1-score 92.0%. In addition, the high area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) of over 0.95 for the CNN also signed for its excellent discriminatory power. These outcomes only exemplify CNN usefulness in the diagnostic area because it is an exact and accurate method for analyzing medical images. Although the nets CNNs are deployed in clinical cases may help address concerns regarding interpretability, compliance with regulations, and ethical opinions, such issues still exist and require further exploration. Overall, this research takes the first steps in directing algorithmic approach towards medical diagnosis and show the feasibility in deployment of CNNs as inseparable pieces of equipment in modern healthcare.

AB  - Blockchain technology, first introduced in 2008, emerged as a solution to establish trust for confidential online transactions, particularly between donors and non-profit organizations. With the acceptance of digital currencies, charities can now reach new groups of donors. Fundraising platforms that support international donations are convenient for finding charities to support. Blockchain technology allows for transparent and secure tracking of donated funds, ensuring they reach their intended destination without intermediaries. This enhances donor protection against fraud and provides transparency. Additionally, AI is used in predicting the hospital that has a lesser amount than the patient requested and rises only a certain amount to the patient's need for the operation by analyzing data and identifying potential donors, ensuring data accuracy and integrity.

AB  - This paper proposes a novel method to enhance classification performance and the reduction of high-dimensional feature maps by fusing deep learning with adaptive neuro-fuzzy network (ANFN). Although deep learning can be used to generate input data as high-dimensional nonlinear features, thereby achieving high classification performance, this method challenges remain in interpreting data with uncertain meanings. Because fuzziness is a characteristic that can be used to process and interpret such data, research is being actively conducted to combine the advantages of fuzziness and deep learning. In conventional fusion methods, high-dimensional feature maps are reduced via principal component analysis (PCA), a linear dimension reduction technique. We propose a fuzzy feature selection (FFS) scheme that maintains nonlinear patterns, and the One-vs-Rest Deep-ANFN Fusion model (ORDAF) to identify feature channels useful for each class. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves comparable or superior performance to that of the conventional method with only 5–20 feature channels per class among the high-dimensional features of deep learning. To evaluate the performance of ORDAF through feature selection optimization, the Defungi, Kaggle images, and CIFAR-10 datasets were used for channels specific to each class, with fewer feature channels than conventional deep-learning-based classification. In this study, classification was facilitated by removing unnecessary feature channels from the model, and a more direct interpretation was obtained by checking specialized channels. In subsequent studies, these methods can be used to develop a highly explainable technology that determines which area of the original data corresponds to each selected channel.

AB  - Leukemia is a severe form of blood cancer that presents significant challenges in both diagnosis and treatment. Early and accurate detection is crucial for successful patient outcomes, but traditional diagnostic methods relying on pathologist expertise can be subjective and time-consuming. This can lead to delays in identifying the appropriate treatment plan, especially given the complexity of accurately categorizing leukemia subtypes. To address these challenges, a study has been conducted to comprehensively evaluate Deep Learning (DL) techniques for leukemia classification. The study compares the performance of conventional Machine Learning (ML) methods with cutting-edge Transfer Learning (TL) models across multiclass scenarios. The study employed Laplacian of Gaussian-based Modified High-boosting (LoGMH) for image enhancement, along with image augmentation techniques such as brightness and rotation adjustments to expand the dataset. Additionally, feature extraction using the gray-level run length matrix (GLRLM) was applied to improve feature representation. Among the models tested, Inception-ResNet emerged as the top performer, achieving an accuracy of 95.52% and an F1 score of 95.49% in distinguishing five leukemia subtypes. This research underscores the potential of TL models in advancing medical diagnostics, particularly in the early detection and precise classification of leukemia, thereby enhancing patient care in hematology and oncology. The future research will focus on integrating additional clinical data, validating models in diverse clinical environments, and emphasizing model transparency and interpretability.

AB  - Intelligence (AI) in expediting glaucoma detection and enabling consensus. The Vision Transformer (ViT) model is a promising solution for this problem as it uses the self-attention mechanism to improve performance and interpretability. Furthermore, eye-tracking data provides valuable information about a clinician's decision-making process during the diagnosis of glaucoma using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) reports. In this study, two approaches were originated for incorporating eye-tracking data into the ViT's training process, using solely eye movement fixation order and attention-alignment loss. Fixation-order-informed (FOI) ViT models were found to perform better than the original ViT model, with fewer parameters and faster training. The use of attention-alignment in the ViT loss function resulted in improved performance when the effect of clinician-generated spatial attention was increased. The attention maps generated by these modified ViTs enabled interpretability and made the reasons for missed predictions more transparent especially for our FOI ViT model. Overall, these findings demonstrate the potential of using expert eye-tracking data to improve the performance of ViT models in glaucoma diagnosis.

If artificial intelligence is currently used in all fields and sectors such as healthcare, education, research, business, transportation, drones and other fields, these multiple uses raise many risks related to the possibility of infringing the right to privacy and protection of personal data, bias and discrimination, as well as risks related to unemployment, security, transparency, and regulatory and legislative gaps. In this paper, we discuss defining the concept of artificial intelligence governance and the parties responsible for achieving this governance. Then we study the initiatives of artificial intelligence governance at the international level, such as Shanghai Declaration on Global AI Governance, IMF Framework for AI Governance, UNESCO's AI Ethics Recommendation, The OECD AI Principles and the European AI Act. Through these initiatives, we have reached the most important principles of artificial intelligence governance such as Accountability, Transparency, Equity, Data Privacy and Security, Ethical Use of AI, Inclusivity, Sustainability, Adaptability and Collaboration.

AB  - Healthcare delivery and patient monitoring have been transformed by the fast rise of the Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT). Cloud storage of sensitive health data creates privacy issues. Logistic Regression (LR) is used to ensure IoHT data sharing in this investigation. The cloud architecture allows efficient data exchange while protecting health information. LR is used to predict data sharing risk and make privacy choices. A varied collection of health measures and demographic data trains the model to generalize well to numerous contexts. The suggested system is tested extensively with Logistic Regression, which reliably identifies and mitigates privacy threats. Data accessibility and privacy are balanced by the model's high sensitivity and specificity. It also examines the model's interpretability to provide privacy prediction factors. This openness improves user trust and regulatory compliance. This technique is scalable for large-scale IoHT installations. The cloud-based IoHT data sharing challenge has a unique approach. Machine learning, especially Logistic Regression, protects privacy without reducing health data usefulness. This research increases healthcare data security in the connected device age.

AB  - Pneumonia is a prominent source of illness and deaths globally, particularly in children and senior citizens. Traditional techniques of reading chest X-rays can be complex and susceptible to errors due to the subtle and overlapping signs of lung disorders, hindering accurate and timely diagnosis and treatment. Deep learning, a new advancement in AI, offers the potential to enhance diagnostic reliability and efficacy. This paper uses a convolutional neural network (CNN), a deep learning model, to identify pneumonia disease in chest X-rays. This paper reflects upon a framework, generating and assessing DL techniques for diagnosis of pneumonia, building on existing research in the field. Deep neural network topologies are evaluated for accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and computational efficiency. The study found that deep learning models can outperform traditional diagnostic approaches, making them a valuable tool for healthcare providers. However, issues like model interpretability, data variability, and clinical integration are also addressed. Our findings highlight the potential for deep learning to improve pneumonia diagnosis, leading to more accurate, efficient, and accessible healthcare solutions. Future research directions should solve current constraints and expand the use of this technology in therapeutic settings.

AB  - Recent years have witnessed tremendous advancements within the medical imaging domain, with brain tumor detection arising as an integral area necessitating further research and development. Sophisticated imaging modalities including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and positron emission tomography (PET) have enabled detailed cerebral visualization. Notwithstanding their accomplishments, persisting impediments exist including inconsistent datasets and requisite enhanced interpretability. Additionally, investigation continues into methods to augment generalization and interpretability capacities, this work investigates potential synergies between state-of-the-art algorithms and medical imaging modalities to enhance brain tumor identification. The research looks at how well-known algorithms YOLO NAS (You Only Look Once Neural Architecture Search) and model perform, with both showing impressive accuracy levels above 95%. Prospectively, amalgamating these algorithms within a multi-modal framework holds promise for improved overall brain tumor detection accuracy. Within the dynamic neuroimaging domain, these modalities harbor immense potential to profoundly impact early diagnosis and augment patient outcomes, contingent on persistent research efforts addressing existing obstacles and refining methodological approaches.

AB  - Breast cancer poses a significant global health challenge, affecting millions of women each year and leading to substantial cancer-related deaths. Early detection is crucial, particularly in regions with limited resources and inefficient healthcare systems where late-stage diagnoses are common. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel approach that employs machine-learning algorithms for early breast cancer prediction. Our model integrates a diverse ensemble of machine-learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Decision Tree Classifier. This ensemble harnesses the collective predictive power of these algorithms to distinguish between benign and malignant tumor types, enabling early diagnosis and prompt intervention. Furthermore, our approach enhances predictive capabilities by incorporating Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and additional KNN algorithms. Each algorithm contributes unique strengths to the ensemble: SVM excels in identifying complex data relationships, Logistic Regression offers interpretability, Random Forest handles large datasets and captures intricate patterns, while KNN adapts well to irregular decision boundaries. By leveraging the strengths of these diverse algorithms, our proposed system provides a more comprehensive and accurate breast cancer prediction model. Through ensemble learning, we mitigate individual algorithm weaknesses and improve predictive performance, thereby advancing the effectiveness of early breast cancer detection and ultimately improving patient outcomes.

AB  - Clinical decision-making is complex and time-intensive. To help in this effort, clinical recommender systems (RS) have been designed to facilitate healthcare practitioners with personalized advice. However, designing an effective clinical RS poses challenges due to the multifaceted nature of clinical data and the demand for tailored recommendations. In this article, we introduce a 2-Stage Recommendation framework for clinical decision-making, which leverages a publicly accessible dataset of electronic health records. In the first stage, a deep neural network-based model is employed to extract a set of candidate items, such as diagnoses, medications, and prescriptions, from a patient's electronic health records. Subsequently, the second stage utilizes a deep learning model to rank and pinpoint the most relevant items for healthcare providers. Both retriever and ranker are based on pre-trained transformer models that are stacked together as a pipeline. To validate our model, we compared its performance against several baseline models using different evaluation metrics. The results reveal that our proposed model attains a performance gain of approximately 12.3% macro-average F1 compared to the second best performing baseline. Qualitative analysis across various dimensions also confirms the model's high performance. Furthermore, we discuss challenges like data availability, privacy concerns, and shed light on future exploration in this domain.

AB  - Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is one of the major causes of blindness worldwide and a complication of diabetes. Therefore, early identification and intervention are important to reduce the extent of vision loss and improve prognosis for patients. This paper presents an improved model for screening DR at its initial stage in retinal images using deep learning methods. The developed system employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect abnormalities in retinal images that indicate early signs of DR, thereby increasing the chances of screening in clinics. The proposed system utilizes large-scale Kaggle DR and Messidor datasets, with an optimized CNN for the analysis of retinal images. To address issues related to variations in image quality and acquisition methods, various data enhancement strategies are incorporated into the model. Additionally, an interpretability module based on Grad-CAM is included to explain the model's classifications and build trust with clinicians. Based on experimental results, it can be concluded that the proposed model demonstrates higher accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity compared to benchmark methods. This system shows potential in reducing the workload of ophthalmologists and improving early DR screening, particularly in resource-limited healthcare settings. Furthermore, it can be extended to other ophthalmic diseases, offering significant benefits to the broader healthcare system.

AB  - Machine learning models are often criticized for their black-box nature, raising concerns about their applicability in critical decision-making scenarios. Consequently, there is a growing demand for interpretable models in such contexts. In this study, we introduce Model-based Deep Rule Forests (mobDRF), an interpretable representation learning algorithm designed to extract transparent models from data. By leveraging IF-THEN rules with multi-level logic expressions, mobDRF enhances the interpretability of existing models without compromising accuracy. We apply mobDRF to identify key risk factors for cognitive decline in an elderly population, demonstrating its effectiveness in subgroup analysis and local model optimization. Our method offers a promising solution for developing trustworthy and interpretable machine learning models, particularly valuable in fields like healthcare, where understanding differential effects across patient subgroups can lead to more personalized and effective treatments.

AB  - Current medical prediction models struggle with three key challenges: (1) lackluster performance on real-world health records, (2) reliance on non-routine tests (e.g., ECGs or blood tests), and (3) model uninterpretability, which prevents adoption. A key challenge is that increasing transparency often decreases the model’s performance. We present FRISTS (Feature-Ranked Interpretable Sequential Time Series), a novel medical prediction approach that uses patients’ previous medical history records to predict future diagnoses. FRISTS combines time series-based recurrent neural networks, e.g. LSTMS, AI-guided feature selection, and a Shapley-inspired permutation method that enables interpretability. We applied our model to 18 million health records in the Cerner Health Facts database to predict heart failure, which yielded a six-fold increase over decision trees and a significant increase over LSTM while capturing more condition-specific features. Since FRISTS is extendable to any prediction task on electronic health records, it accelerates the adoption of machine learning methods in AI-assisted healthcare that achieve both high real-world performance and interpretability.

AB  - Tuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is a lung-focused infectious disease with a profound impact on the respiratory system. Although advancements in healthcare have improved detection of various diseases, TB remains a global health issue, especially in developing regions. Efficient TB diagnostics can be achieved through the deep-learning-based image classification techniques. In this work, a novel hybrid model is introduced in which two approaches are proposed. In the first approach, TrioFusionNet integrates three Convolutional models known as ResNet-50, InceptionV3, and EfficientB4 to detect deep features. After deep feature set creation, Principal Component Analysis is employed to decrease the feature dimensionality. The second approach utilizes the EAMSO (Ensemble of AMS Optimization model) for feature selection. It combines the results from AEO (Artificial Ecosystem-based Optimization), MBO (Monarch butterfly optimization), and Seagull-Algorithm to form three optimized feature subsets. These subsets are correlated by ensemble model, and the optimal features from EAMSO are input into an Artificial Neural Network for classification. The TrioFusionNet + EAMSO model combines features from three CNNs and selects the best ones using an ensemble optimization method. This approach improves accuracy and provides clear explanations of the results, making it more effective than existing methods. The various models are compared for analyzing the performance of the classification using two benchmark CXR image datasets. The proposed model yields a remarkable average accuracy value of 98.80%. Furthermore, explainable Artificial Intelligence experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed diagnostic approach.

AB  - Early diagnosis plays a critical role in preventing severe complications and fatalities associated with kidney disease, especially in regions like Saudi Arabia, where healthcare access may be limited. Prompt identification of the disease can significantly mitigate its severity and enhance patient outcomes. This study introduces an intelligent system for early kidney disease diagnosis utilizing machine learning (ML) models. We conducted a comparative analysis of various models, such as Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Gradient Boosting (GB), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Decision Tree (DT), with the SVC model achieving the highest accuracy of 72.00%. RF and KNN closely followed with 68.00% accuracy each, while the DT model, despite its interpretability benefits, achieved an accuracy of 56.00%. The interpretability of the DT model could be particularly advantageous in healthcare diagnostics where transparency is crucial. RF exhibited the highest precision at 0.71, proving effective in reducing false positives. The proposed system presents a promising solution for improving early kidney disease diagnosis and could be seamlessly integrated into mobile platforms, offering practical real-world applications for healthcare professionals and patients, especially in underserved areas.
