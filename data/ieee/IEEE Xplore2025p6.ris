AB  - In recent years, the interpretability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has garnered significant attention, particularly due to their widespread deployment in critical domains like healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems. To address the challenge of understanding how DNNs make decisions, Explainable AI (XAI) methods, such as saliency maps, have been developed to provide insights into the inner workings of these models. This paper introduces DiffCAM, a novel XAI method designed to overcome limitations in existing Class Activation Map (CAM)-based techniques, which often rely on decision boundary gradients to estimate feature importance. DiffCAM differentiates itself by considering the actual data distribution of the reference class, identifying feature importance based on how a target example differs from reference examples. This approach captures the most discriminative features without relying on decision boundaries or prediction results, making DiffCAM applicable to a broader range of models, including foundation models. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the superior performance and flexibility of DiffCAM in providing meaningful explanations across diverse datasets and scenarios.

AB  - In recent years, machine learning (ML), including deep learning, has been adopted in various safety-critical domains, such as healthcare, manufacturing, communications and transportation. Despite safety practices implemented during model design and development, unique ML challenges, such as data corruption, data drift, and data anomalies or novelties, can emerge after model deployment. These challenges underscore a pivotal concern: ensuring the operational safety of ML models. Currently standards such as ISO/IEC TR 5469 and IEC 61508 lack comprehensive guidelines for managing these post-deployment challenges across the full ML lifecycle. Moreover, the inherent complexity and lack of transparency in various ML models further contribute to this issue. To bridge this gap, we propose AMLOP, a comprehensive, sevenstage framework specifically designed to assure ML operational safety through systematic model monitoring. This framework is based on four ML monitoring architectures, offering systematic guidance for implementing ML runtime monitoring effectively. The framework's efficacy is demonstrated through a case study on 5G network slicing, presenting its potential to enhance ML operational safety. This framework aligns with global standardization efforts, providing clear guidance toward achieving safe, trustworthy, and robust ML deployments.

AB  - Elderly patients often face high risks of chronic diseases such as heart conditions, and improving clinical decision support for their care is a priority. This paper presents a comprehensive review and empirical study of machine learning-driven decision support systems for elderly healthcare, leveraging the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV critical care datasets. We examine data preprocessing strategies such as handling missing values via imputation and normalization, feature engineering techniques including domain-specific feature creation and dimensionality reduction, and Machine Learning (ML) models for heart disease risk prediction with an emphasis on ensemble methods such as Random Forests and XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting). We also explore medication recommendation systems powered by ML and discuss approaches to integrating predictive models into user-friendly healthcare dashboards. Our experiments focus on predicting heart disease-related outcomes in patients aged 60 and above using Random Forest and XGBoost, showing that both models achieve strong predictive performance, with XGBoost outperforming Random Forest in terms of AUC. We integrate these findings with the existing literature, highlighting challenges such as data quality, interpretability, and ethical considerations. The results demonstrate the potential of ML, especially tree-based ensembles, to enhance decision support for elderly care, while emphasizing the significance of robust data preprocessing and the need for interpretable and clinically integrated solutions. We conclude with discussions on future research directions, including addressing bias in models, ensuring generalizability, and improving clinician adoption of AI-driven tools.

AB  - Mental health disorders pose great challenges to clinicians, which have few training resources, guard privacy in patient data, lack standardized scenarios for training therapists, and validity difficulties when interventions are assessed. Traditional role-playing doesn't seem to portray the richness and diversity associated with mental health conditions due to ethical constraints that generally prohibit direct contact with clients. This paper introduces a novel application of GANs to meet these challenges by simulating realistic scenarios of mental illness. Present implementations of GANs in health care face enormous difficulties due to the lack of interpretability and bias detection capabilities coupled with clinical validation. We address these limitations through Explainable GANs, a novel architecture for model design that involves explainable AI techniques. This framework will make the generation process of scenarios transparent and understandable to clinicians and researchers, with high-fidelity simulation of mental health conditions. Our objectives are the development of privacy-preserving synthetic data generation, ensuring clinical validity through expert validation, and creation of interpretable AI outputs for healthcare professionals. The technical framework includes sophisticated data processing pipelines, robust model architectures, and integrated explainability components that address some of the critical challenges in data privacy, bias mitigation, and clinical reliability. Comprehensive evaluation metrics and clinical validation allow us to demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in generating realistic, clinically relevant scenarios while maintaining transparency and interpretability.

AB  - In metro cities, many people face skin issues because of air pollution, changes in water, and synthetic food, mainly affecting the outside layer, which causes itching and swelling. Among all the skin diseases, skin cancer is one of the most common and life-threatening types of cancer, and early detection can have a significant impact on patient outcomes. In this paper, we introduce SkinNet++, a Novel Lightweight Multi-Layered Learning Model (NLM-LLM) based on an ensemble of convolutional layers designed to be efficient and accurate for real-time skin cancer detection. The existing models are more overloaded architectures that obtain memory issues. The pretrained model Adaptive InceptionV3 was trained on various benchmark datasets. InceptionV3 can capture complex skin lesions based on the affected patterns using RGB images. SkinNet++ adopts multiple shallow and optimized convolutional blocks for extracting diverse feature representations while introducing low computational costs with advanced classification rates. The model is trained and tested on benchmark datasets ISIC and HAM10000, and results compare favorably in accuracy of 98.56 %, sensitivity of 99.34, and specificity of 99.41. With its lightweight architecture and high inference speed, it is also applied to mobile and edge devices where it is possible to provide immediate support for medical diagnosis, even in resource-scarce conditions.

AB  - Due to the revolutionary influence of clinical image processing brought about by the rapid development of AI and ML, medical diagnostics have significantly improved. This study investigates how AI-powered machine learning models may improve clinical image processing using picture segmentation, categorization, and augmentation. Conventional image processing techniques find it challenging to manage complex and changeable data from medical imaging modalities. To overcome these challenges, convolutional neural networks and other deep learning architectures have shown great promise. This paper compares and contrasts the various AI-powered models for automating organ segmentation, disease classification, and tumor detection. Image analysis and integration of ML models allow for near-real- time processing without compromising accuracy. To address the inadequately labeled medical data, we use data augmentation and transfer learning techniques to enhance model performance and generalizability across datasets. We evaluate AI-powered mod- els against traditional rule- based algorithms using processing speed, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity metrics. The findings demonstrate that AI models frequently outperform the status quo in terms of accuracy and false positive count. As they relate to AI in healthcare settings, the research addresses ethical issues such as interpretability, algorithmic bias, and patient privacy. The findings demonstrate how clinical image processing can be transformed by AI-driven machine learning models, particu- larly in terms of diagnostic processes, the accuracy of medical interventions, and the reduction of labor costs for healthcare workers. Future research will focus on enhancing these models' adaptability to various clinical contexts and exploring hybrid approaches that combine AI with traditional image-processing techniques.

AB  - People who experience panic attacks usually find it very difficult to convey what they experience. Apart from this, another major challenge is to actually know when the panic attack happens and how severe it was physically. Real-time healthcare trackers and anxiety level trackers lack specificity and accuracy in detecting panic attacks. The proposed system is specifically designed to detect panic attacks and ultimately detect the severity of the condition the patient is in. Usage of advanced sensors and random forest machine learning algorithms pushes it to 80% to 95% accuracy with proper calibration. The system aims to detect and record the time and duration of the panic attack by reading the physical response of the user. Since the human body shows the same physical symptoms such as increased pulse, heart rate even during a normal physical workout, advanced sensors are also being included such as Galvanic Skin Conductance sensor. The data is being trained in such a way that the system would detect only panic attacks and not other non-panic attack events. The data thus confirmed as panic attacks are being recorded and the details are being sent to the concerned persons via IOT System that have integrated with system. This data is accessible only to the physician handling the patient and the guardian. This in short helps both the physician treating the individual and the individual who is facing the panic attacks himself/herself.

AB  - Cardiovascular illnesses and cardiac arrests, in particular, have become the major cause of death allover the world, highlighting the need to develop new methods for early prediction and diagnosis for better treatment and prevention. The proposed work integrates the application of Random Forests in a predictive ML (ML) model boosted with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, to be able to predict if the cardiac arrest could happen or not. The RF model was trained using a clinical database consisting of demographic, social and medical data and was able to predict the chances of a cardiac arrest with an increased level of precision. XAI techniques like SHAP (Shapley additive explanations) and Partial dependency plots (PDP) were utilized to improve the accuracy and the reliability of the model with XAI. Together, these techniques helped to explicate the forecast yielded by the model as to what features were important and what were the predictions that led towards the conclusions in the model. Cholesterol levels, along with blood pressure and age, were among the key indicators scrutinized that supported the functioning of the model. The results presented in the last section highlighted the main risk factors and provided additional relevant information to healthcare providers, which could greatly improve their decision-making and treatment of patients by knowing what treatments to provide to which patients. The investigation addresses the challenge of the medical AI paradigm by overcoming the trade-off between prediction performance and interpretability by developing AI devices that are clinically usable from the use of ML to XAI. The proposed approach enables the prediction of cardiac arrests at an early stage, with the goal of assisting patients and minimizing the costs incurred by the health facilities, by increasing the anticipatory, allowing improved patient care and preventive methods for patients.

AB  - Manifold learning techniques play a pivotal role in machine learning by revealing lower-dimensional embeddings within high-dimensional data, thereby enhancing the efficiency, interpretability, and scalability of data analysis. Despite their utility, current manifold learning methods often lack explicit functional mappings, which are critical for ensuring explainability in regulated and high-stakes applications. This paper introduces Genetic Programming for Explainable Manifold Learning (GP-EMaL), a novel integration of Genetic Programming (GP) and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). GP-EMaL leverages the inherently interpretable, tree-based structures of GP to generate explicit, functional mappings while directly addressing complexity challenges through innovative penalties for tree size, symmetry, and operator selection. By enabling customisable complexity metrics, GP-EMaL adapts to diverse application needs, achieving high manifold quality and significantly improved explainability. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that GP-EMaL matches or exceeds the performance of existing approaches, producing simpler and more interpretable models. This work advances the state of explainable manifold learning, paving the way for its adoption in domains such as healthcare, environmental modelling, and financial analysis.

AB  - Alzheimer's Disease (AD) predominantly impacts cognitive functions such as memory and reasoning, especially in the aging population. Early detection is crucial for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes. Traditional diagnostic techniques often rely on neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, which are invasive, expensive, and not feasible for large-scale screening. Moreover, certain approaches lack interpretability and may not be applicable in resource- constrained healthcare environments. While machine learning algorithms have been employed for AD classification, they often depend on manual feature selection and struggle to handle high- dimensional omics datasets effectively. To address these limitations, this study introduces a hybrid framework that integrates SHAP and LIME explainability methods with advanced deep tabular learning architectures such as TabNet, FT-Transformer, and DeepMPL. The classification task leverages a dataset of 600 samples incorporating 140 lipidomic features and four CSF biomarkers Amyloid- $\beta$, Tau, p-Tau, and Neurogranin sourced from ADNI and institutional studies. Missing data were handled using CSF Amyloid-based thresholds, and the features were scaled using the RobustScaler technique. Experimental analy- sis reveals that the FTTransformer model achieved the best performance, attaining a classification accuracy of 94% and an AUC of 0.98, surpassing conventional methods such as Random Forest and XGBoost. The proposed model not only captures intricate patterns among biomarkers but also offers interpretable outputs, making it a promising tool for early, non-invasive AD detection. Future directions include integrating multi-omics data and validating the approach in clinical settings.

AB  - Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) seeks to enhance transparency, accountability, and trust in computer systems. In healthcare, ensuring regulatory compliance and fostering user confidence are critical objectives. Nasal cytology is a promising yet underutilized diagnostic technique for rhinitis and allergies, primarily due to the labor-intensive nature of manual cell counting. Moreover, it remains one of the few medical subfields where XAI has yet to be widely explored. To address these challenges, we propose a novel automated pipeline for nasal cytology analysis that combines object detection with interpretable and fuzzy-enhanced cell classification. The system follows a divide-and-conquer approach, utilizing YOLOv8 for cell detection and ProtoTree, an intrinsically interpretable model, for cell classification. To improve decision-making under uncertainty, we investigated three fuzzy t-norm operators to select the best path in the tree at prediction time, enhancing interpretability and robustness. Experimental evaluations showed YOLOv8 achieving an AP50 of 0.861, while the ProtoTree classifier, tested with various CNN backbones — including a novel YOLOv8-based variant — achieved an F1-score of 0.534. Despite challenges with rare cell types due to dataset imbalance, the system demonstrated strong performance in identifying common cell types such as epithelial cells and neutrophils. By incorporating fuzzy logic into an explainable AI framework, our approach advances the accessibility and efficiency of nasal cytology while ensuring interpretability. This fusion of symbolic reasoning and deep learning highlights the potential of fuzzy-enhanced XAI for trustworthy medical diagnostics.

AB  - Classifying heartbeat sounds is a critical step in improving cardiovascular diagnostics, especially as reliance on traditional stethoscope assessments can be limited by human subjectivity. In this study, we explored the application of machine learning techniques to the PhysioNet Heartbeat Sound Database, aiming to differentiate normal from abnormal heart sounds with both accuracy and consistency. Our approach integrates unsupervised K-means clustering, which identifies natural groupings within the data, with supervised classification models to validate these groupings and enhance predictive power. Key acoustic features-such as pitch, RMS energy, MFCCs, and formants-were extracted to provide a comprehensive representation of the heart sounds. To streamline classification, we applied the InfoGain algorithm, selecting the 50 most significant features from an initial set of 238. This process ensured that the models focused on the most relevant information, improving efficiency and interpretability. We evaluated four classifiers-SVM (SMO), Decision Tree (J48), Naive Bayes, and k-NN (IBK)-using a 10-fold cross-validation approach. SMO and J48 demonstrated strong performance, achieving accuracies of 97.4% and 96.02%, respectively, with high Kappa statistics, showcasing their reliability in distinguishing heart sound categories. These results highlight the potential of machine learning in addressing critical healthcare challenges, particularly when labeled data is scarce. Future work will focus on expanding the dataset, incorporating neural network architectures, and exploring additional clustering methods to further improve generalizability and diagnostic accuracy.

AB  - The metaverse is based on emerging technologies and has immense potential to improve clinical and overall well-being outcomes. However, it is susceptible to attacks such as port scanning, probing, and distributed denial-of-service in health care analytics. These have to be addressed with efficient 6G-enabled intrusion detection systems that are capable of recognizing abnormal behavior in health care in the metaverse. The traditional anomaly detection approaches are impaired by class imbalance, poor feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning that limit their performance. In this work, a novel anomaly detection system with 6G technology is introduced that employs reinforcement learning (RL) to address class imbalance and attribute selection. The performance is optimized by utilizing the Bayesian Optimization Hyperband (BOHB) hyperparameter-tuning method. The process of RL is further improved by incorporating explain ability approaches for minority class boosting in classification and selection of significant features. The model is evaluated on MA WI and NSL-KDD data with improved accuracy, AVC and F-measure at 90.691 %, 92.423%, 0.817 and 90.604%, 93.565%, 0.822. These results confirm the model's ability to detect cyber threats in healthcare in the metaverse and pave the way for safer and more reliable digital health ecosystems.

AB  - Detection of skin cancer stands important for effective care which improves long-suffering survival probabilities since this disease represents a globally common and life-threatening condition. The clinical practice of examining patients and laboratory biopsy assessments offers reliable diagnostics but requires both time and skilled personnel to perform. The research develops a sophisticated deep learning skin cancer detection solution through a hybrid framework using CNNs including MobileNetV2 and VGG16 and ResNet50. The model receives training from a diversified collection of labeled skin lesion images that facilitates its power to differentiate between various lesion sort such as melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell cancer and malignant skin conditions. Model performance and robustness increases through using different image preprocessing methods that include data augmentation together with noise reduction and color normalization. Better generalization across skin types becomes possible through these preprocessing steps because they enhance the quality of input images during processing. The evaluation of the proposed system demonstrates its diagnostic potential through performance metrics that show high prediction quality measures. Results show how artificial intelligence with medical imaging creates opportunities to create a skin cancer diagnostic system which does not need invasive procedures while being accessible and reliable. The model exists for clinical and remote healthcare deployment with fast screening capabilities and affordable operation. Research plans involve developing an expanded database as well as performance optimization across different skin colorations and implementing explainable AI techniques to promote clinical trust in deep learning diagnostic tools.

AB  - The interactive attention graph convolution network (IAGCN), a novel model proposed in this article, will revolutionize aspect-level sentiment analysis (SA). IAGCN effectively addresses these key features, in contrast to prior research that ignored the meaning of aspect terms and their relationship with context. The model combines a modified dynamic weighting layer with bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) to accurately acquire context. It takes use of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to encrypt syntactic information from the syntactic dependency tree. Furthermore, a method for interactive attention is employed to discover the intricate relationships between context and aspect terms, which results in the reconstruction of those terms' representations. Comparing the proposed IAGCN model to baseline models, impressive gains are made. Across five datasets, the model beats previous methods with an amazing improvement in F1 scores that ranges from 1.34% to 4.04% and an impressive improvement in accuracy that ranges from 0.56% to 1.75%. Additionally, the IAGCN model outperforms the global vectors (GloVe)-based strategy when the potent pretrained model bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) is included in the challenge, resulting in even greater improvements. The F1 score considerably increases from 2.59% to 7.55%, and accuracy increases from 1.47% to 3.95%, making the IAGCN model a standout performer in aspect-level SA.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease diagnosis is an issue when the current protocols are ambiguous. The models employed in this work result in more transparency and decision making for patients and clinicians. The following deep learning models were used; CNN, AlexNet, DenseNet, and ResNet, with a comparison made between the models trained using the original dataset, and the same dataset converted to HSV format. For balancing the classes Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was used during the preprocessing step. Accurate identification was highest for CNN on the original images and DenseNet on the images converted to HSV color space. The method does not only enhance the diagnosis precision but also enhances confidence since the doctors acquire an understandable explanation of the models' decision-making process, afford them a practical technique in enhancing Alzheimer's patients' care.

AB  - The integration of machine learning into healthcare has transformed medical diagnosis and monitoring, enabling earlier detection and personalized treatment. Anomaly detection, particularly for arrhythmias in ECG signals, is critical but faces challenges in interpretability, robustness, and modeling complex temporal dynamics. Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) offer a promising alternative to traditional approaches by modeling continuous-time dynamics, embedding physics-based constraints, and handling irregularly sampled data. However, their practical efficacy and limitations in healthcare remain underexplored. In this study, we compare Neural ODE-based approaches to traditional deep learning methods for arrhythmia detection in heartbeat data. Specifically, we evaluate a Neural ODE model against a ResNet architecture for both binary and multi-class classification. Our experiments aim to assess the strengths and weaknesses of Neural ODEs in capturing the temporal dependencies and anomalies present in ECG signals. We demonstrate the potential of Neural ODEs to enhance anomaly detection in healthcare, especially in scenarios involving nonuniform or irregularly sampled data. At the same time, we consider key challenges, such as computational complexity that must be addressed to fully realize their benefits. Our findings contribute to the growing body of research on continuous-time models in healthcare, offering insights into their applicability for real-world medical diagnostics and monitoring, and pave the way for further exploration of Neural ODEs in anomaly detection tasks.

AB  - Machine learning models have the potential to play a significant role in the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. However, for these models to be clinically reliable, they must be explainable. In this study, various machine learning algorithms were applied to distinguish between myocarditis and acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and the explainability of these models was evaluated. Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest models were trained using data obtained from Turkey’s largest cardiology hospital. The obtained results were analyzed through global feature importance and SHAP values to explain the decision mechanisms of the models. The study aims to enhance physicians’ trust in AI-based systems by illustrating how Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques can be applied in medical diagnosis settings.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence is playing an increasingly prominent role in healthcare. For this integration to continue evolving effectively, professionals in the field, including doctors, psychologists, and nurses, must trust the technology. In the domain of Large Language Models, this trust requires transparency in the sources of information, ensuring they are verifiable and reviewed. This paper presents an intelligent diagnostic assistant designed to support differential diagnosis and disease comparison, leveraging an LLM enriched with the Retrieval-Augmented Generation technique to address trust-related challenges. The knowledge base for our system is PubMed, a biomedical article aggregator, which supplies relevant articles on the considered disorders, as well as evidence supporting or refuting potential links between them. Retrieval-Augmented Generation empowers the model to incorporate external knowledge tailored to the specific question while providing citations for its statements. These citations not only enhance the trustworthiness of the answers but also enable practitioners to explore the referenced articles in greater detail. We developed a prototype of our system, and conducted an evaluation through questionnaires administered to 12 professional psychologists. Results show that our system compares favorably with state of the art Large Language Models in providing the relevant information to distinguish between two diseases, and that the provided details are useful for supporting differential diagnosis.

AB  - Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a progressive condition that requires accurate diagnosis and staging for effective clinical management. Conventional CKD diagnosis relies on estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR), a measure of kidney function derived from serum biomarkers such as serum creatinine (SCr) and cystatin C (SCysC). However, eGFR calculations may be inaccurate when applied to diverse patient populations. This study proposes a machine learning (ML) system that integrates regression-based eGFR estimation, metaheuristic optimization using the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), and multi-class classification with various ML models to enhance CKD staging and classification. The model estimates eGFR using three established CKD Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations incorporating SCr, SCysC, and their combined values. Regression models assess predictive performance, specifically Linear Regression (LR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). SVR demonstrates superior performance compared to LR for  $\text {CKD-EPI}_{\text {SCr-SCysC}}$  achieved a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 3.03, a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 2.97%, and a coefficient of determination ( $\text {R}^{2}$ ) score of 0.97. The application of GWO for hyperparameter tuning has resulted in a 37.3% reduction in root mean square error (RMSE), a 37.4% drop in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and a 2.06% improvement in  $\text {R}^{2}$  to improve the precision of prediction. Once the model fine-tunes the eGFR estimations, it feeds them into various algorithms for CKD stage classification, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). Among these, XGBoost achieves the highest classification accuracy of 97.76%, along with an F1-score of 97.45%, demonstrating its effectiveness in CKD staging. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) provide global and local feature importance insights, enhancing clinical decision-making and model transparency. Future research will validate the model using more extensive and more diverse datasets. Additionally, it will incorporate extra clinical parameters, including biomarkers and genetic data, to enhance the precision of CKD risk prediction. This research enhances AI-driven nephrology by providing a scalable, interpretable, and highly accurate solution for diagnosing and managing CKD.

AB  - Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal classification is important for the early detection of cardiac arrhythmias and the avoidance of life-threatening complications. This work compares several machine learning algorithms—XG Boost, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression—on benchmark ECG datasets to evaluate their ability to correctly classify cardiac abnormalities. XG Boost produced better results with 0.99 accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score due to its gradient boosting mechanism, regularization properties, and efficiency in class imbalance handling. Random Forest and SVM came in close second, producing strong and consistent performance with accuracies ranging from 0.97–0.98, and thus, they are appropriate for use in scenarios where real-time analysis and noisy condition generalization are needed. Logistic Regression, though computationally fast, performed below 0.70 accuracy because of its linear nature and inability to handle complex ECG morphology. Comparative evaluation indicated that each model has unique strengths based on the deployment context: XG Boost is best for high-accuracy diagnostics in cloud-based clinical environments, SVM performs best in low-latency real-time wearable devices, and Random Forest is optimal for retrospective ECG analysis and hospital batch processing. Performance metrics and detailed model behaviour were analysed to enable clinical interpretability and trust. In addition, the work suggests a tiered architecture that balances accuracy in diagnosis with computational efficiency through the allocation of lightweight models for primary screening and heavy-duty classifiers for confirmatory diagnosis. These outcomes provide a basis for the integration of AI in highly scalable, resource-conscious cardiac care systems with high reliability and clinical applicability.

This paper will focus on the development of a machine learning-based framework for the classification of AMR in pneumonia using a dataset inspired by bacterial genomic and phenotypic features. Some key algorithms, such as ExtraTrees, LightGBM, and Random Forest, have been used to build the predictive models that can identify resistant bacterial strains. The ExtraTrees algorithm had the highest accuracy of 97.08%, which shows that it is efficient in handling high-dimensional datasets and capturing feature interactions. LightGBM was close to this with an accuracy of 96.63 %, showing superiority in speed and computational efficiency, while Random Forest had an accuracy of 96.59 %, which showed greater stability and interpretability in noisy datasets. This study demonstrated the potential capability of machine learning models to realize early diagnosis with targeted treatment, thus improving outcomes for patients' clinical care by extensive exploratory data analysis and rigorous model evaluation.

AB  - Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) is a vision-threatening condition in premature infants requiring timely and accurate diagnosis to prevent blindness. While electronic health (eHealth) technologies promise to improve neonatal care, automating ROP diagnosis faces challenges such as limited labeled datasets, architectural complexity, and high computational demands. This study introduces LightEyeNet, a lightweight deep-learning architecture optimized for eHealth applications in ROP severity classification. By integrating DenseNet121 and a channel-wise residual attention network block, LightEyeNet enhances diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Explainable AI techniques, including Grad-CAM and LIME, further improve transparency and clinical interpretability. LightEyeNet achieves 96.28% testing accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art pre-trained networks, including DenseNet201 (95.78%, + 0.5%), Inception-V3 (93.80%, + 2.48%), Xception (94.54%, + 1.74%), and EfficientDense (87.10%, + 9.18%). Furthermore, LightEyeNet is the most compact architecture among these, with a size of 2.45 MB, compared to Efficient-Dense (6.88 MB), Inception-V3 (3.56 MB), Xception (21.48 MB), and DenseNet201 (5.05 MB). With a specificity of 0.99, a sensitivity of 0.95, and an AUC score of 0.99 across five ROP severity classes, LightEyeNet demonstrates a balance of superior performance and efficiency.

AB  - Glucose monitoring plays a vital role in maintaining metabolic and nutritional balance. However, invasive methods, while accurate, are often painful and impractical for routine use. This study presents a non-invasive glucose monitoring framework that integrates a high-intensity Superbright optical sensor with an IoT-enabled data acquisition system using ESP32 microcontrollers and Raspberry Pi. The IoT-based architecture enables seamless integration with cloud computing platforms, allowing remote access and scalability for large-scale population-level screening and monitoring. The system captures glucose-related optical signals, which are analyzed using various machine learning algorithms, including a novel Convolutional Neural Network–Attention Hybrid Model (CNN-AHM). CNN-AHM combines spatial feature extraction with attention-based prioritization of relevant signal patterns, enhancing both accuracy and interpretability. Among all models tested, CNN-AHM demonstrated the best standalone performance (RMSE =14.06 mg/dL), representing a 13.18% improvement over its baseline configuration. When combined with complementary strength of the second-best performing Random Forest Regressor (RF-R), the system achieved a substantially improved RMSE of 7.62 mg/dL and an R2 of 0.83. This work underscores the importance of integrating sensor technology, deep learning, and explainable modeling to advance non-invasive glucose monitoring solutions. Future directions include extending the architecture with explainable AI using SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) to provide feature-level interpretability, and exploring real-world deployment scenarios.

AB  - Objective: Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a life-threatening disorder commonly observed in emergency departments. Patients with acute pancreatitis may necessitate transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) if standard treatments prove ineffective. The development of a machine learning (ML) model that can precisely forecast the necessity for ICU admission in patients with acute pancreatitis might dramatically enhance in-hospital healthcare for patients. Methods: For this study, data were extracted from the MIMIC-III Clinical Database Care-Vue subset (MIMIC-III v 1.4), Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV v 3.1), and eICU Collaborative Research Database (v 2.0). Fifteen features were identified through Boruta's algorithm, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso), and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) utilizing the XGBoost. Results: Seven machine learning models, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Neural Network (NNET), etc. were developed based on these features. The neural network approach demonstrated the highest reliability, attaining an AUC of 0.891, sensitivity of 0.852, and specificity of 0.767 in the test set. Meanwhile, an interpretability assessment of the most robust models was performed utilizing Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to prioritize feature importance and elucidate the final model. This model has been deployed on a web platform: https://icupredict.shinyapps.io/shiny6/. Conclusions: The neural network model effectively predicted whether patients with AP would be transferred to the ICU, demonstrating optimal performance. Significance: We developed an interpretable ML model for prediction of ICU admission in AP patients. It provides clinicians with a reliable tool for early identification and treatment.

AB  - Despite much progress towards malaria eradication, malaria remains a major global health problem, especially in areas lacking expertise in expert microscopists. Although automated malaria diagnosis by deep learning has recently emerged as a promising approach, current methods are mostly unsuitable for generalization and interpretability. To the best of our knowledge, in this study, we propose a multi-modal deep learning framework for parasite detection in microscopic blood smear images that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). However, CNNs are powerful at extracting local spatial features while ViTs exploit self attention to generate a complete feature representation. We train and validate our model on publicly available malaria image datasets using state of the art data augmentation strategies, transfer learning, and state of the art attention mechanisms in order to maximize diagnostic accuracy. Experimental results show the superior performance of the proposed hybrid compared to conventional CNN based models on the basis of accuracy, precision and recall. In addition, explainability techniques like Grad-CAM and attention heatmaps explain what the model is deciding. The contribution of this study is to demonstrate the promise of multi modal deep learning in transforming malaria diagnosis to more interpretable, scalable, and AI based healthcare.

AB  - Emergency Medical Services (EMS), while vital for rapid response to life-threatening emergencies, face challenges such as resource constraints, time-sensitive decision-making, and limited access to specialized expertise. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative tool in EMS, offering potential improvements in diagnostics, resource allocation, and emergency response through its ability to analyze medical data, recognize patterns, and support decision-making. This systematic review, adhering to PRISMA guidelines and utilizing the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Tools, evaluated 12 high-quality studies (selected from 571 screened papers across PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar) to assess AI's impact on EMS. Key findings revealed that AI-based clinical decision support systems significantly reduced hospital readmissions by enabling accurate risk prediction and timely interventions, while AI-enhanced dispatch tools, such as automatic speech recognition software, improved stroke detection and response times. Additionally, AI-assisted protocols in critical ambulance services demonstrated reliability in high-stakes environments, fostering trust among emergency medical technicians. However, challenges including healthcare providers' adaptation to AI tools and the need for standardized safety protocols highlight gaps in implementation. The variability in AI adoption across EMS settings limits broad conclusions, underscoring the necessity for future research to include diverse environments, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, to evaluate AI's adaptability. Developing universal benchmarks for assessing AI technologies in EMS, alongside addressing ethical concerns like algorithmic transparency and equitable resource distribution, will be critical to optimizing AI's role in enhancing emergency care outcomes globally.

AB  - Medical imaging is crucial in modern healthcare, providing key insights into anatomy and aiding in illness diagnosis, tracking, and treatment planning. Images from technologies like MRIs, CT scans, X-rays, and ultrasounds allow easy visualization of structures, detection of anomalies, and monitoring of medical conditions. The traditional image denoising techniques have less interpretability because they don't rely on data training. In this work, a hybrid approach to image denoising is presented that makes use elements of EfficientNetB3 and Pix2Pix models. The EfficientNetB3's efficient scaling and feature extraction capabilities, combined with the Pix2Pix's image-to-image translation capabilities, enable the model to effectively remove noise while preserving essential image features. The proposed structure provides a viable way to raise both the accuracy and reliability of medical image assessments.

AB  - sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea, insomnia, narcolepsy, periodic limb movement disorder, and REM behavior disorder, are becoming more common and are frequently underdiagnosed because traditional diagnostic tools, such as overnight polysomnography are expensive and require the presence of a specialist. This paper presents a real-time, AI-empowered diagnostic framework, namely SomnoDx, for diagnosing multiple sleep disorders through the deep learning-based analysis of multimodal physiological signals along with audio-based features. The proposed architecture utilizes 1D CNN and BiLSTM layers as building blocks for extracting spatial-temporal patterns of EEG, ECG, SpO2 data and running in parallel a CNN branch for handling MFCC based audio features. An attention stream combines these two flows to improve interpretability by highlighting diagnostically relevant regions. The proposed model does multi-label classification, which enables coexisting disorder diagnosis at the same time, and is evaluated on the publicly available datasets such as Sleep-EDF, ISRUC-Sleep, MIT-BIH, Apnea-ECG, and MESA. The whole framework is developed and tested in Google Colab as it allows to perform near real-time processing of 30-second signal windows. SomnoDx also obtains high accuracy and low latency, while exhibiting SHAP- and Grad-CAM based interpretability for clinical understandability. Although the current deployment is research centric, the system is developed in such a way that it can be integrated in future into a cloud-based system and also into a smartwatch-compatible application using model compression like TensorFlow Lite and ONNX. The solution acts as a missing link from academic formulations to real-world utility, providing a scalable efficient and explainable solution that will help transform digital sleep medicine and registry treatment monitoring.

AB  - Big data in healthcare involves gathering, analysing, and interpreting vast amounts of medical information, such as electronic health records (EHR), diagnostic images, and real-time sensor data from wearable devices. With the growing volume of healthcare data, there is an increasing demand for sophisticated machine learning models that can process this data and extract meaningful insights. One of the most important uses of healthcare big data is predicting cardiac diseases, where early and accurate diagnoses can significantly enhance patient outcomes. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with attention mechanisms, known for their ability to process sequential time-series data, are particularly effective in analyzing dynamic signals like ECGs and heart rate data. The attention mechanism improves the LSTM's ability to focus on the most relevant parts of the input data, thus boosting model performance, especially in handling complex sequences. This study introduces an LSTM with Attention Mechanism model that surpasses traditional machine learning algorithms in classifying cardiac diseases, yielding higher precision and recall. These findings highlight the value of LSTM with attention mechanisms in enhancing the accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability of predictive models for cardiovascular diseases, providing a scalable solution for real-time, data-driven healthcare systems.

AB  - This study presents a deep learning-based framework for automated hair disease classification using the ResNet50 model. Combining the capabilities of transfer learning, the model was trained on a dataset of 10 hair disease categories, consisting of 9600 training and 1200 validation images, with an overall accuracy of 95%. Results show consistent and reliable classification across all categories with high true positive rates for conditions such as Alopecia Areata and Lichen Planus using metrics of precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix. Techniques such as data augmentation, batch normalization, dropout, and learning rate adjustments were used to ensure robust generalization. The model validated further its effectiveness to generalize to unseen data, as validated by the trends in validation accuracy and loss. While successful, there were small misclassifications observed between similar conditions showing potential areas to improve. Expanding on the dataset, exploring the inclusion of interpretability tools such as Grad-CAM and building user friendly clinical applications are among future directions. Deep learning holds the promise of transforming dermatological diagnostics to a scalable, accurate and time efficient hair disease classification process.

AB  - This paper presents a computational framework that combines supervised machine learning and multi-objective optimization to support data-driven decision-making for resource allocation in public healthcare systems. The study uses real-world data from 51 public hospitals across Southern and Northern Italy, ensuring a representative sample of diverse healthcare structures. It analyzes the interplay between hospital admission volumes, adherence to quality standards, operational efficiency, and energy costs. The framework integrates several predictive models—including Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Logistic Regression—developed in Python using the scikit-learn library. Model performance was optimized using calibration techniques, while interpretability was enhanced through SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), which identified the most influential clinical areas affecting both efficiency and energy expenditure. Feature importance results were used in a dual-objective linear optimization function to determine the optimal distribution of hospital admissions across nosological areas, balancing scale efficiency and energy cost reduction. Additionally, a multi-objective genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) was applied to optimize quality standard adherence levels, generating trade-off solutions along a Pareto frontier. The proposed approach offers a transparent, explainable, and scalable tool for healthcare administrators, providing actionable insights for strategic resource allocation. By integrating interpretable machine learning with computational optimization, the model contributes to building sustainable and high-performing hospital systems aligned with both operational and environmental objectives.

AB  - Facial Expression Recognition (FER) and Human Activity Recognition (HAR) are key areas in wearable computing, with applications in healthcare, fitness, and human-computer interaction. This study explores the use of Emteq’s OCOsense smart glasses for FER and HAR, which incorporate optomyographic sensors and a 9-axis inertial measurement unit (IMU). Using deep learning (DL) models, including CNNs, ConvLSTM, and STResNet variants, the study compares the performance of FER for six expression classes and HAR for seven different activities. We investigate the impact of the ConvBoost framework on model performance, extending its use beyond HAR with IMU data and introducing end-to-end learning for FER using OCOsense smart glasses. Our findings confirm that ConvBoost effectively improves performance of complex overfitting-prone models. Furthermore, the results also reveal that using ConvBoost in simpler models, such as the 1-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN 1D), leads to a decrease in F1-score. The best performing models, Attention ConvLSTM for FER and ConvLSTM for HAR (in combination with ConvBoost), achieved a macro F1-score of 0.78 and 0.88, respectively. These results highlight the potential of smart glasses for FER and HAR, establishing benchmark results for future advancements in glasses-based wearable computing.

TORNADO integrates large-scale foundation models for perception, language comprehension, and high-level reasoning, to achieve strong zero-shot generalization across a wide range of tasks. At its core, the platform features an adaptive cognitive pipeline capable of dynamically reconfiguring its modules—including semantic 3D SLAM, people-aware navigation, dexterous manipulation, and human-in-the-loop learning—to manage uncertainty and adapt to changing conditions. Additionally, TORNADO incorporates a multi-modal Learning-from-Demonstration interface and an Explainable AI engine, enhancing transparency and easing the burden of teaching new tasks. The system is validated through three industry-relevant scenarios: (1) flexible gear and ply-sheet handling in a mechanical parts factory, (2) patient support in a hospital palliative ward, and (3) product sampling and waste management in a distribution center. TORNADO aims to significantly improve the agility, safety, and overall task performance of mobile manipulators operating in dynamic, human-centric environments.

AB  - In dermatology, the task of skin lesion classification is a very important one, for early detection and treatment of skin cancer. In this work, we propose a hybrid AI model where Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used for feature extraction and a Random Forest (RF) classifier for final decision making. We evaluate the proposed model on the ISIC dataset: images of multiple types of skin lesion (melanoma, benign nevi, seborrheic keratosis). Experimental results show that the hybrid CNN_RF model surpasses stand alone models in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, yielding an accuracy of 89.5%, precision of 88.9%, recall of 89.2% and F1 score of 89.0%; the standalone CNN and RF models resulted in accuracies of 85.3%, 78.6% respectively. The method proposed successfully strikes a good balance between feature learning and classification robustness, using the resultant model to provide better generalization. Finally, we perform qualitative analysis using Grad-CAM visualizations to motivate the model towards focusing on relevant lesion regions which improves interpretability. Moreover, the RF classifier also provides the feature importance insight to support clinical decision making. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, confirms that the model has a strong discriminative power with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.92. The hybrid model shows stable learning without sharply decreasing the training set error; in other words, there is no strong overfitting of training data. The learning process also demonstrates stable training and validation accuracy curves and can be used in real applications. The results show that the CNN RF hybrid model is a promising solution for automated skin lesion classification which provides higher accuracy, interpretability and robustness.

AB  - This study probes diabetes prediction through gene expression profiling which uses machine learning methods as an enhancement. Four machine learning algorithms achieve performance assessment through accuracy together with sensitivity and specificity while using AUC-ROC evaluation metrics. The algorithms in question are Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), and Logistic Regression (GLM). The process of preparing data through scale adjustment of features and categorical encoding and data value management enables both model resiliency and information quality improvement. A new prediction model using Random Forest algorithm as an ensemble with Logistic Regression aims to achieve optimal accuracy. The strength of connections between feature data and outcome results is measured through logistic regression but random forest supports effective handling of complex high-dimensional data. The hybrid methodology results in superior accuracy and F1 scores to advance the performance of prediction. Two visualization techniques namely ROC curves and feature importance analysis help to increase model interpretability. The study proves that machine learning produces successful outcomes in healthcare analytics as it provides an early diabetes detection system and patient risk stratification abilities. Improved prediction accuracy and generalizability through deep learning model implementation and expanded data collection represent future directions for this research.

AB  - Objective: In Long-Term Monitoring (LTM), noise significantly impacts the quality of the electrocardiogram (ECG), posing challenges for accurate diagnosis and time-consuming analysis. The clinical severity of noise refers to the difficulty in interpreting the clinical content of the ECG, in contrast to the traditional approach based on quantitative severity. In a previous study, we trained Machine Learning (ML) algorithms using a data repository labeled according to the clinical severity. In this work, we explore Deep Learning (DL) models in the same database to design architectures that provide explainability of the decision making process. Methods: We have developed two sets of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): a 1-D CNN model designed from scratch, and pre-trained 2-D CNNs fine-tuned through transfer learning. Additionally, we have designed two Autoencoder (AE) architectures to provide model interpretability by exploiting the data regionalization in the latent spaces. Results: The DL systems yield superior classification performance than the previous ML approaches, achieving an F1-score up to 0.84in the test set considering patient separation to avoid intra–patient overfitting. The interpretable architectures have shown similar performance with the advantage of qualitative explanations. Conclusions: The integration of DL and interpretable systems has proven to be highly effective in classifying clinical noise in LTM ECG recordings. This approach can enhance clinicians' confidence in clinical decision support systems based on learning methods, a key point for this technology transfer. Significance: The proposed systems can help healthcare professionals to discriminate the parts of the ECG that contain valuable information to provide a diagnosis.

AB  - This study introduces a novel framework that bridges the gap between deep learning and interpretability in stress detection systems using wearable sensor data. While most existing models prioritize prediction accuracy using black-box techniques, the work is distinguished by its integration of a mathematically transparent stress index with a high-performing deep learning pipeline. Physiological signals-Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Electrodermal Activity (EDA), and Body Temperature-were collected from wearable devices and processed through a CNNLSTM architecture, achieving 94% accuracy, 96% precision, 95% recall, and 94 % F1-score. Further, a mathematical modelling of stress was done as a nonlinear composite index based on five physiological transformations. The weights and bias of this index were not arbitrarily set or manually tuned, but calculated by aligning the model's sigmoid-transformed output with that of the CNN-LSTM predictions. Using graphical intersection analysis and numerical optimization, the interpretable coefficients were derived, that maintain a high fidelity to the deep learning output. The final mathematical model demonstrated strong alignment with the hybrid model, achieving a MAE of 0.0306 and RMSE of 0.0348. This interpretable formulation not only mirrors deep learning performance but also offers deployment-ready transparency-making it suitable for clinical and real-time wearable applications. The approach marks a significant step toward fusing explainable models with state-of-the-art deep learning for healthcare AI.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with an increasing prevalence among the elderly, making early and accurate diagnosis critical for effective intervention and management. This paper introduces an end-to-end machine learning pipeline optimized for detecting AD using multimodal data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The study proposes an ensemble model that integrates key modalities-demographics, cognitive scores, neuropsychological assessments, and MRI data-via early fusion to enhance AD detection. Various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Networks, are compared, and feature selection is optimized through Recursive Feature Elimination, ANOVA F-value, and mutual information methods, with mutual information showing the most efficacy. With further hyperparameter tuning, the highest accuracy is achieved at 95.85%, with Gradient Boosting as the top-performing model. Additional experiments assess and evaluate individual modality contributions, underscoring the predictive value of cognitive scores and neuropsychological features. To enhance clinical interpretability, we incorporate model explainability using LIME and SHAP, which identify key features influencing model predictions across different AD stages. Explainable AI (XAI) is essential in healthcare for providing transparency and supporting clinician confidence by highlighting which biomarkers, such as MMSE, CDRSB, and PTAU, contribute most to diagnostic outcomes. This study demonstrates classical machine learning's potential in AD diagnostics, offering a pathway to cost-effective and clinically viable models for neurodegenerative disease management.

AB  - The early identification of hyperacute stroke situations remains essential for fast clinical care and better treatment results. The presence of data leakage continues to be an significant because it produces inflated performance metrics which fail to match actual clinical applications. This research presents a novel framework for identifying and mitigating data leakage in machine learning models for hyperacute stroke detection. This research also investigates current methods before proposing an innovative joint method using Mutual Information (MI), chi-square and ANOVA scores to eliminate data leakage throughout feature selection. Additionally, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) technique is employed for combatting class imbalance and to enhance prediction reliability. Experimental findings establish the proposed framework as robust by providing notable improvements in how consistently classifiers perform. This research fills an important void by evaluating a common interpretability weakness which now provides both reliable deployment methods for real use and clearer assessment outputs.

AB  - Blood group typing is a critical procedure in transfusion medicine, organ transplantation, and pregnancy management. Ensuring patient safety requires accurate and rapid blood typing, as incompatible transfusions can lead to severe complications, including hemolytic reactions. Traditional serological methods are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to human error due to reliance on manual interpretation. This study presents an automated approach to blood group classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a deep learning algorithm renowned for its proficiency in image analysis. Leveraging a labeled dataset of blood sample images, the proposed model achieved an overall classification accuracy of 87.50%. Additionally, precision and recall values for each blood group classification were notably high, underscoring the model’s reliability and effectiveness. By identifying specific patterns and features in blood sample images, the CNN-based system enhances diagnostic efficiency, minimizes human intervention, and reduces errors, particularly in resource-limited clinical settings. This work demonstrates the feasibility of integrating artificial intelligence into blood typing workflows, contributing to modernized transfusion practices and improved patient outcomes.

AB  - Diagnostic imaging is an important technique which helps in diagnosing several diseases at the initial stage in order to take necessary treatments. Nevertheless, conventional techniques tend to have issues with regard to precision, speed, and quantitatively assessing multidimensional medical information. In this paper, we reveal the potential of deep convolutional networks (DCNs) in the field of medical image diagnostic. It means that, with the help of deep learning algorithms DCNs can learn meaningful features of medical images and improve diagnostic accuracy and speed. The near proposed technique involves the use of deep convolutional network model to analyse medical images for diagnosis of diseases such as cancer, heart diseases and neurological disorders. The obtained experimental results demonstrate that the presented model has the highest accuracy of 96.5% with very high sensitivity and specificity coefficients compared to other methods. Further, the interpretability of the proposed DCN model and different aspects of it are discussed to support clinical validation. Through this research, the effectiveness of deep learning in revolutionizing the diagnosis for medical imaging diagnostics while early disease detection and treatment is established.

AB  - Accurate and interpretable AI models play a critical role in medical image analysis. However, despite advancements in explainable AI (XAI), existing methods struggle with inconsistent interpretability. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Integrated Latent and Attention Mapping (ILAM) framework, which enhances both classification accuracy and explainability by fusing local and global feature representations. ILAM integrates a custom-designed Autoencoder (AE) with a Vision Transformer (ViT), where the AE learns fine-grained local features through unsupervised patchwise image reconstruction in the latent space. These local features are then fused with global representations extracted by ViT, creating a hybrid model that improves both performance and post hoc interpretability. To refine explainability, ILAM incorporates a modified attention rollout mechanism, which recursively aggregates latent feature representations and attention weights to produce precise and stable activation maps. We evaluate ILAM on three publicly available medical imaging datasets—BreakHis, Chest X-Ray, and Retinal, demonstrating its superior performance over transformer-based models such as ViT, DeiT, CvT, and SwinT. ILAM consistently generates detailed and reliable activation maps, providing clearer visualizations of critical image regions influencing model decisions. By effectively combining local and global feature fusion, ILAM establishes itself as a robust and interpretable framework for medical image classification.

AB  - The combination of blockchain technology and the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) is driving revolution in healthcare data security. Blockchain technology has a strong security feature that makes data be delivered without illegal access because it ensures integrity and transparency through an immutable decentralized ledger. Tamper-evident records within the health care sector have transformed data sensitivity and privacy for these care services. IPFS is another decentralized file storage that can be used to give blockchain technology an added feature, which is better access to data and minimizing central servers whenever possible. The ensuing discussion examines points where blockchain, and IPFS intersect to assist in solving immediate issues of security with regards to fraud, data breaches, and poor data management. It is backed with case studies and real-world implementation, which points to easy information exchange, optimal protection of patient data, and improved interoperability of disparate health systems. It also encompasses some other problems with regards to integration complexity, regulatory adherence, and scalability. Potential innovations and upcoming trends are given consideration while assessing, which means that the integration of IPFS and blockchain technology has the potential to cause massive improvement in healthcare information security and develop a culture of efficiency and trust. Furthermore, the paper explores the discipline of healthcare data security management too, thereby enhancing patient outcomes, by making the entire system stronger.

This survey presents a taxonomy-driven synthesis of 150+ peer-reviewed studies spanning seizure phase modeling, thalamic EEG biomarkers, edge inference, and clinical AI integration.We introduce an eight-axis framework covering neurophysiological foundations, machine learning advances, wearable inference pipelines, large language model (LLM) assistants, and privacy-preserving architectures. A key focus is the emerging role of thalamic stereo-EEG (sEEG) as a high-fidelity substrate for modeling seizure transitions and informing closed-loop interventions. Unlike prior reviews, this work explicitly unifies preictal and postictal phase dynamics with modern AI tools—such as federated learning, explainable deep learning, and agentic reasoning. We highlight gaps in dataset diversity, clinical interpretability, and cross-center generalization, while proposing a translational roadmap toward ethical, explainable, and deployment-ready seizure care.

AB  - The intricacies of cancer present formidable challenges in achieving effective treatments. Despite extensive research in computational methods for drug response prediction, achieving personalized treatment insights remains challenging. Emerging solutions combine multiple omics data, leveraging graph neural networks to integrate molecular interactions into the reasoning process. However, effectively modeling and harnessing this information, as well as gaining the trust of clinical professionals remain complex. This paper introduces ExplainMIX, a pioneering approach that utilizes directed graph neural networks to predict drug responses with interpretability. ExplainMIX adeptly captures intricate structures and features within directed heterogeneous graphs, leveraging diverse data modalities such as genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. ExplainMIX goes beyond prediction by generating transparent and interpretable explanations. Incorporating edge-level, meta-path, and graph structure information, it provides meaningful insights into factors influencing drug response, supporting clinicians and researchers in the development of targeted therapies. Empirical results validate the efficacy of ExplainMIX in prediction and interpretation tasks by constructing a quantitative evaluation ground truth. This approach aims to contribute to precision medicine research by addressing challenges in interpretable personalized drug response prediction within the landscape of cancer.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) based anticancer drug recommendation systems have emerged as powerful tools for precision dosing. Although existing methods have advanced in terms of predictive accuracy, they encounter three significant obstacles, including the “black-box” problem resulting in unexplainable reasoning, the computational difficulty for graphbased structures, and the combinatorial explosion during multistep reasoning. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel Macro-Micro agent Drug sensitivity inference (MarMirDrug). Specifically, our methodology enhances interpretability via knowledge graphs (KG). To reduce computational overhead, our MarMirDrug also transforms the graph structures of KG into low-dimensional embeddings. To manage the combinatorial explosion of graph paths that occurs with increasing inference steps, we incorporate a macro-micro dual-agent reinforcement learning algorithm, and combines reinforcement learning with KG-based reasoning to infer path reasoning. In computational experimental outcomes, the efficiency of our embedding model surpasses that of the baseline model, achieving an average improvement of 117.65% for hit score. Also, our dual-agent framework exhibits superior performance and interpretability in drug response prediction, with AUC values outperforming conventional baseline methods. In summary, our approach integrates interpretability, computational efficiency, and predictive accuracy, providing novel contributions to precision medicine. The source code and data of MarMirDrug are available at https://github.com/Minhua-F/MarMirDrug_code.

AB  - Human motor learning is a neural process essential for acquiring new motor skills and adapting existing ones, which is fundamental to everyday activities. Neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s Disease (PD) and stroke can significantly affect human motor functions. Identifying neural biomarkers for human motor learning is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies for such disorders. However, identifying specific neural biomarkers associated with motor learning has been challenging due to the complex nature of brain activity and the limitations of traditional data analysis techniques. In response to these challenges, we developed a novel Spatial Graph Neural Network (SGNN) model to predict motor learning outcomes from electroencephalogram (EEG) data using the spatial-temporal dynamics of brain activity. We used it to analyse EEG data collected during a visuomotor rotation (VMR) task designed to elicit distinct types of learning: error-based and reward-based. By doing so, we establish a controlled environment that allows for precisely investigating neural signatures associated with these learning processes. To understand the features learned by the SGNN, we used a set of spatial, spectral, and temporal explainability methods to identify the brain regions and temporal dynamics crucial for learning. These approaches offer comprehensive insights into the neural biomarkers, aligning with current literature and ablation studies, and pave the way for applying this methodology to find biomarkers from various brain signals and tasks.

AB  - Sleep is a biological necessity for the healing of the body and the mind. Reduced physical activity and consciousness are its defining characteristics. The duration, timing, and quality of sleep can all be negatively impacted by sleep issues. They may thereby raise the chance of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, strokes, obesity, and cognitive diseases including dementia. Machine learning (ML) offers a more effective, scalable, and impartial way to understand complicated sleep data than manual assessments. This study used a data set of 374 entries gathered from Kaggle to predict sleep issues with an emphasis on sleep apnea and insomnia. Pre-processing steps included feature extraction, feature splitting, and categorical data management. In addition to five classification models (Random Forest, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), and Decision Tree), we also employed three boosting models (AdaBoost, CatBoost, and Gradient Boosting). Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and CatBoost achieved 95% accuracy in predicting sleep issues, while the other methods achieved 91%. We believe that our suggested framework can be served as a decision support system (DSS) for early sleep problem diagnosis, with the potential to make a substantial contribution to the healthcare industry.

Unlike prior approaches, this system is optimized for real-time inference and has been rigorously validated on a diverse, multi-institutional dataset comprising over 12,000 annotated radiographs. The model achieves high diagnostic performance, with a sensitivity of 96.2%, specificity of 94.8%, and an AUC of 0.983, significantly outperforming baseline CNN and hybrid models. It also delivers sub-50 millisecond inference time, making it suitable for deployment in emergency and high-throughput healthcare settings. Furthermore, the integration of Grad-CAM visualizations supports interpretability, enhancing clinical trust.

AB  - Smart health tracking systems have been implemented in sports with the aim to leverage athletes’ metrics to optimize coaching strategies, however, fully automated and generic interventions have led to demotivating athletes and disengagement. To fill in the gaps, we explore current health coaching strategies obtaining perceived benefits, risks, and challenges from off-the-shelf wearables that are relevant to performance and propose a person-centric health coaching dashboard design coupled with explainable AI (PXAI-Coach) to enable athletes to engage in health monitoring and coaching strategies. We interviewed 27 college student athletes and their 6 coaches to gain insight on their experiences using wearable technologies to monitor health and performance, and evaluated the proposed prototype design. We highlight design guidelines to personalize user goals, adapt preference needs, explore explainable algorithms, and support data-driven insights for informed decision-making.

AB  - Information Retrieval (IR) systems which provide accurate and contextually relevant information to healthcare and law etc. where accuracy is very crucial. Traditional information retrieval methods fundamentally based on keyword matching and statistical models usually difficult to achieve the semantic meaning and contextual nuances of queries. Case-Based Reasoning (CBR), as an artificial intelligence technique, provide advance solutions to enhance IR systems based on a set of past cases through adaptive context-supporting retrieval. By taking advantage of past cases data, CBR allows IR systems to interpret complex context-sensitive queries and offer personalized results. The paper provides an overview of traditional IR models, examines the CBR integration into these systems, and evaluates the impact of CBR on retrieval effectiveness and personalization. And finally, we elaborate on the challenges involved with scaling and adapting cases towards real-time retrieval and provide some future directions for research, including integrating machine learning techniques and hybrid models to enhance the relevance, interpretability, and scalability of CBR-based IR systems.

AB  - As cloud computing becomes foundational to sectors like healthcare, finance, and artificial intelligence, accurate resource utilization forecasting has emerged as a critical challenge for ensuring efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and service reliability. This research introduces Runtime-Assembled Context-Specific Cooperative Artificial Neural Networks (RACANN), a novel modular neural framework designed to predict cloud resource utilization with improved interpretability and efficiency. Unlike monolithic deep learning models, RACANN dynamically assembles lightweight context-specific neural agents at runtime, enabling fine-grained temporal adaptability and significantly reducing computational overhead. We further propose eRACANN, an explainable extension that embeds a fuzzy logic-based linguistic layer, offering human-readable justifications for predictions. Experimental results across both structured and noisy real-world datasets demonstrate that while deep neural networks (DNNs) may achieve marginally lower error rates, eRACANN excels in modularity, interpretability, and contextual transparency which are critical properties for operational deployment in dynamic, mission-critical cloud environments. The RACANN framework offers a scalable path toward explainable, adaptive, and resource-efficient AI for cloud infrastructure management.

AB  - In this study, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based method for eye disease recognition is proposed, aiming to identify multiple common eye diseases through automatic analysis of fundus images. The model uses deep learning technology to extract features from fundus images and classify them without complicated manual feature engineering. The experimental results show that the proposed CNN model has excellent performance in several evaluation indexes such as accuracy, accuracy, recall rate and F1-score, and the interpretability of the model is improved by visualization technology such as Grad-CAM. The performance of the model in different categories and its comparison with traditional methods are also analyzed. Although factors such as data set imbalance and image quality have an impact on model performance, the approach shows great potential for early screening of eye diseases. In the future, combined with more complex network architectures, multi-modal data fusion, and deep integration with clinical practice, deep learning is expected to achieve more widespread applications in ophthalmology and the broader medical diagnosis field.

AB  - Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are a formidable and ever-evolving threat to global cyber security, particularly against critical infrastructure, government networks, and cyber-physical systems. Exhibiting high levels of sophistication, persistence, and stealth, APTs have a propensity to bypass traditional defense mechanisms dependent on signatures and pre-defined rules. Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), such as deep learning, federated learning, graph neural networks, reinforcement learning, and adversarial learning, have introduced novel paradigms for real-time threat detection and proactive defense strategies. This paper presents a comprehensive and organized overview of state-of-the-art AI-based solutions for the detection, attribution, deception, and response to APTs. Illustrative case studies from sectors like financial networks, healthcare networks, cloud infrastructures, and national critical assets are discussed, highlighting realistic challenges, performance metrics, and optimal implementation practices. Emerging challenges are also explored, such as data availability constraints, labeling inconsistencies, risks of model compromise, vulnerability to adversarial attacks, and scalability constraints in real-time. The findings emphasize the supreme necessity of interdisciplinary research, as well as collaborative activities by academia, industry, and government, to create scalable, explainable, and anticipatory cyber security solutions that can effectively address APTs in future digital ecosystems.

The system leverages a publicly available thyroid dataset, consisting of various clinical parameters, for preprocessing and model training. The ML pipeline begins with data preprocessing techniques such as handling missing values, normalization, and feature selection to ensure the quality of input data. Logistic Regression, as a baseline model, provides interpretability and initial insights into the dataset. Random Forest, a robust ensemble algorithm, is employed for its capability to handle high-dimensional data and prevent over fitting. Support Vector Machine, with its kernel-based approach, demonstrates high performance in identifying non-linear relationships within the data. K-Nearest Neighbors is utilized for its simplicity and effectiveness in capturing local patterns. Extensive experimentation is conducted to evaluate the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC). Results reveal that Random Forest outperforms other algorithms in terms of accuracy and recall, demonstrating its suitability for thyroid classification. However, SVM also achieves competitive results, particularly for imbalanced data scenarios. The study highlights the importance of feature selection and hyper parameter tuning to optimize model performance.

Large Language Models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, provide large-scale AI-supported solutions for nutritional planning, physical activity prescription, and behavioral treatment. Their safety, accuracy, and effectiveness, nonetheless, have to be tested. Objective: This systematic review introduces the potential of LLMs in the treatment of obesity and their advantages, disadvantages, and ethics. Methods: The PubMed, Scopus, and IEEE Xplore databases were searched from 2023 to 2025 for peer-reviewed journal articles on the use of LLMs for weight management following PRISMA standards. Results: The promise of LLMs was discovered to discover individualized diet and exercise regimens, promote user engagement, and provide pharmacotherapeutic management of obesity. But there are issues of AI-generated advice reliability, user input quality dependence, absence of human control, and ethical issues like data privacy and accountability. Conclusion: Though LLMs enhance availability for obesity control, their potential risks need stringent control. Hybrid human-AI offers a solution that can maximize benefits while securing safety and efficacy. Future studies need to enhance transparency in AI, formulate regulatory systems, and promote cultural flexibility for equitable health utilization.

AB  - Medical websites and healthcare records now contain an enormous variety of health-related data from online and offline medical check-ins and consultations. However, because there are few symptom-disease connections, it is difficult to leverage user-generated material to help patients get around online and receive medical attention offline. The casual and lighthearted ways that symptoms are expressed in the data are what lead to the severe sparsity. To improve therapeutic interventions and diagnostic systems, accurate portrayal of diseases and symptoms is essential. Medical websites and healthcare records now contain an enormous variety of health-related data from online and offline medical check-ins and consultations. However, because there are few symptom-disease connections, it is difficult to leverage content created by users to help patients get around online and receive healthcare offline. The casual and light hearted ways that symptoms are expressed in the data are what lead to the severe sparsity. To improve therapies and diagnostic systems, accurate portrayal of diseases and symptoms is essential. Our method involves a multi-phase approach: first, extracting and encoding structured information from EHRs using advanced techniques such as graph-based neural networks; second, applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques to capture and encode relevant information from clinical texts; and finally, fusing these two modalities to create an enriched representation of medical entities. We evaluate our approach on a dataset of medical records and clinical notes, demonstrating improvements in predictive accuracy and interpretability compared to traditional single-modality methods. The results highlight the effectiveness of combining structural and textual data in advancing the state-of-the-art in medical representation learning. This fusion approach not only enhances the precision of symptom and disease modeling but also provides deeper insights into complex medical relationships, paving the way for more robust and insightful healthcare analytic.

AB  - Despite early diagnosis and prediction of survival, cancer continues to be a major cause of death in the world. There has been an emergence of artificial intelligence in the last few years, especially in the field of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which provide avenues for dissecting complexity in biomedical data. GNNs model structurally non-Euclidean data such as molecular interactions, patient similarity networks, and heterogeneous clinical features, thereby being different from conventional machine-learning methods. This additional strength of GNNs promises to highlight another breakthrough in important areas of cancer biology and progression. This study deals with GNNs in cancer-specific survival outcome modeling with a focus on ovarian vs breast cancers. By employing graph-based representations of clinical and biological determinants, GNNs capture dependencies for even more accurate and personalized predictions. Moreover, imparting time-sensitive clinical data to temporal GNNs would have further enhanced predictability measured by the extent of such temporal factors. According to various literature, GNNs are said to outperform traditional models in areas that have to do with recognition, interpretability, and scalability. Among significant advancements are enhanced strategies for graph construction enriched with medically relevant features applied to imaging data.
