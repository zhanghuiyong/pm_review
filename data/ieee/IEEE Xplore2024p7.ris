AB  - Understanding and inferencing Heterogeneous Treatment Effects (HTE) and Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATE) are vital for developing personalized treatment recommendations. Many state-of-the-art approaches achieve inspiring performance in estimating HTE on benchmark datasets or simulation studies. However, the indirect predicting manner and complex model architecture reduce the interpretability of these approaches. To mitigate the gap between predictive performance and heterogeneity interpretability, we introduce the Causal Rule Forest (CRF), a novel approach to learning hidden patterns from data and transforming the patterns into interpretable multi-level Boolean rules. By training the other interpretable causal inference models with data representation learned by CRF, we can reduce the predictive errors of these models in estimating HTE and CATE, while keeping their interpretability for identifying subgroups that a treatment is more effective. Our experiments underscore the potential of CRF to advance personalized interventions and policies, paving the way for future research to enhance its scalability and application across complex causal inference challenges.

AB  - Ensuring quality human-AI interaction (HAII) in safety-critical industries is essential. Failure to do so can lead to catastrophic and deadly consequences. Despite this urgency, existing research on HAII is limited, fragmented, and inconsistent. We present here a survey of that literature and recommendations for research best practices that should improve the field. We divided our investigation into the following areas: 1) terms used to describe HAII, 2) primary roles of AI-enabled systems, 3) factors that influence HAII, and 4) how HAII is measured. Additionally, we described the capabilities and maturity of the AI-enabled systems used in safety-critical industries discussed in these articles. We found that no single term is used across the literature to describe HAII and some terms have multiple meanings. According to our literature, seven factors influence HAII: user characteristics (e.g., user personality), user perceptions and attitudes (e.g., user biases), user expectations and experience (e.g., mismatched user expectations and experience), AI interface and features (e.g., interactive design), AI output (e.g., perceived accuracy), explainability and interpretability (e.g., level of detail, user understanding), and usage of AI (e.g., heterogeneity of environments). HAII is most measured with user-related subjective metrics (e.g., user perceptions, trust, and attitudes), and AI-assisted decision-making is the most common primary role of AI-enabled systems. Based on this review, we conclude that there are substantial research gaps in HAII. Researchers and developers need to codify HAII terminology, involve users throughout the AI lifecycle (especially during development), and tailor HAII in safety-critical industries to the users and environments.

AB  - Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common joint disease that lowers quality of life and causes damage worldwide. It is more common in elderly people, with knee OA being the most common type. While traditional machine learning and deep learning methods have validated potential in OA identification, they normally struggle to balance spatial feature abstraction and interpretability. Interestingly, the effective combination of convolutional and attention mechanisms to enhance diagnosis accuracy, specifically in OA severity categorization, remains unexplored. Our goal is to minimize this performance discrepancy by developing an efficient diagnostic model for knee OA utilizing CoAtNet. This hybrid architecture combines the advantages of attention mechanisms with convolutional layers for optimal performance. The Kaggle knee osteoarthritis dataset was used to train and assess the model thoroughly. To ensure robustness, key preprocessing methods such as image normalization and data augmentation were used. Experimental results show that the suggested CoAtNet-based model obtains $\mathbf{9 6 \%}$ accuracy, 88% F1 scores, and 87% precision, culminating in an astounding Top 1 accuracy of $\mathbf{9 6 \%}$. In addition to providing a more precise means of diagnosing OA, this model offers a scalable instrument that may be easily included in clinical processes. Using this method could improve knee OA early identification and treatment planning, which would improve patient results and boost overall healthcare proficiency.

AB  - Walking-assistive devices require adaptive control methods to ensure smooth transitions between various modes of locomotion. For this purpose, detecting human locomotion modes (e.g., level walking or stair ascent) in advance is crucial for improving the intelligence and transparency of such robotic systems. This study proposes Deep-STF, a unified end-to-end deep learning model designed for integrated feature extraction in spatial, temporal, and frequency dimensions from surface electromyography (sEMG) signals. Our model enables accurate and robust continuous prediction of nine locomotion modes and 15 transitions at varying prediction time intervals, ranging from 100 to 500 ms. Experimental results showcased Deep-STP's cutting-edge prediction performance across diverse locomotion modes and transitions, relying solely on sEMG data. When forecasting 100 ms ahead, Deep-STF achieved an improved average prediction accuracy of 96.60%, outperforming seven benchmark models. Even with an extended 500ms prediction horizon, the accuracy only marginally decreased to 93.22%. The averaged stable prediction times for detecting next upcoming transitions spanned from 31.47 to 371.58 ms across the 100-500 ms time advances. Although the prediction accuracy of the trained Deep-STF initially dropped to 71.12% when tested on four new terrains, it achieved a satisfactory accuracy of 92.51% after fine-tuning with just 5 trials and further improved to 96.27% with 15 calibration trials. These results demonstrate the remarkable prediction ability and adaptability of Deep-STF, showing great potential for integration with walking-assistive devices and leading to smoother, more intuitive user interactions.

AB  - Machine learning has achieved remarkable success across diverse domains. Nevertheless, concerns about interpretability in black-box models, especially within Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), have become pronounced in safety-critical fields like healthcare and finance. Classical machine learning (ML) classifiers, known for their higher interpretability, are preferred in these domains. Similar to DNNs, classical ML classifiers can exhibit bugs that could lead to severe consequences in practice. Test input prioritization has emerged as a promising approach to ensure the quality of an ML system, which prioritizes potentially misclassified tests so that such tests can be identified earlier with limited manual labeling costs. However, when applying to classical ML classifiers, existing DNN test prioritization methods are constrained from three perspectives: 1) Coverage-based methods are inefficient and time-consuming; 2) Mutation-based methods cannot be adapted to classical ML models due to mismatched model mutation rules; 3) Confidence-based methods are restricted to a single dimension when applying to binary ML classifiers, solely depending on the model's prediction probability for one class. To overcome the challenges, we propose MLPrior, a test prioritization approach specifically tailored for classical ML models. MLPrior leverages the characteristics of classical ML classifiers (i.e., interpretable models and carefully engineered attribute features) to prioritize test inputs. The foundational principles are: 1) tests more sensitive to mutations are more likely to be misclassified, and 2) tests closer to the model's decision boundary are more likely to be misclassified. Building on the first concept, we design mutation rules to generate two types of mutation features (i.e., model mutation features and input mutation features) for each test. Drawing from the second notion, MLPrior generates attribute features of each test based on its attribute values, which can indirectly reveal the proximity between the test and the decision boundary. For each test, MLPrior combines all three types of features of it into a final vector. Subsequently, MLPrior employs a pre-trained ranking model to predict the misclassification probability of each test based on its final vector and ranks tests accordingly. We conducted an extensive study to evaluate MLPrior based on 185 subjects, encompassing natural datasets, mixed noisy datasets, and fairness datasets. The results demonstrate that MLPrior outperforms all the compared test prioritization approaches, with an average improvement of 14.74%$\sim$∼66.93% on natural datasets, 18.55%$\sim$∼67.73% on mixed noisy datasets, and 15.34%$\sim$∼62.72% on fairness datasets.

AB  - Predicting health risks from electronic health records (EHR) is a topic of recent interest. Deep learning models have achieved success by modeling temporal and feature interaction. However, these methods learn insufficient representations and lead to poor performance when it comes to patients with few visits or sparse records. Inspired by the fact that doctors may compare the patient with typical patients and make decisions from similar cases, we propose a Progressive Prototypical Network (PPN) to select typical patients as prototypes and utilize their information to enhance the representation of the given patient. In particular, a progressive prototype memory and two prototype separation losses are proposed to update prototypes. Besides, a novel integration is introduced for better fusing information from patients and prototypes. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our model brings improvement on all metrics. To make our results better understood by physicians, we developed an application at http://ppn.ai-care.top. Our code is released at https://github.com/yzhHoward/PPN.

AB  - The purpose of this work is to improve the precision and performance of heart disease detection through the combined use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning algorithm and multimodal data fusion. It combines several datasets, including genetic data, clinical notes, medical imaging, and lifestyle characteristics, to produce a cohesive picture of the health of our patients. With a focus on the hierarchical representations obtained from medical pictures, a specially adapted CNN architecture is intended to automatically discover complex patterns and features from integrated multimodal data. Our methodology first preprocesses and normalizes various data sources before strategically fusing them at the input level. This combined dataset is used to train the CNN model, which may also use transfer learning to benefit from previously trained models. In order to maximize model performance and prevent overfitting, hyperparameter adjustments and validation are carried out. Evaluation metrics are used to evaluate the model’s performance on a separate test set. These measures include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC. By using feature map visualization and attention mechanisms, interpretability is addressed, and the model’s decision-making process is made clear. Working together with medical specialists guarantees the model’s ethical use and clinical applicability. The model may be made to respond to changing trends in the detection of heart disease through ongoing monitoring and updating.

AB  - Graph data modeling is nontrivial due to the challenges to ensure model interpretability and handle data uncertainty. While methods derived from deep learning models, such as graph neural networks (GNNs), are able to handle graph data, the interpretability is limited. Graph fuzzy systems (GFSs) based on the fuzzy rules and fuzzy inference have been proposed to improve interpretability, but the existing methods are developed for whole graph prediction only and cannot deal with node prediction, which is a more common task in graph data modeling. To tackle the challenges, a novel GFS for node prediction (GFS-node) is investigated in this study. For this purpose, the concepts, framework, and algorithms of GFS-node are systematically developed. First, several related concepts are defined, including the node fuzzy rule base, node fuzzy set, and node consequent processing module (NCPM). A general framework for GFS-node is then presented, where the construction of antecedents and the consequents of fuzzy rules are analyzed. Furthermore, a concrete implementation method of GFS-node is designed. In particular, the kernel K virtual central nodes clustering (KVCN) algorithm is proposed to develop the algorithm for antecedent generation, and the linear message passing network (LMPN) is adopted to develop the algorithm for consequent generation and learning. Experiments are carried out on multiple benchmark datasets, and the results show that GFS-node combines the advantages of both traditional fuzzy systems and classical GNNs for node prediction.

The study utilized a Boosting model, a Decision Tree Classifier, and a logistic regression model to evaluate model performance comprehensively. Among these, the Boosting model achieved the highest accuracy at 81.75%, followed closely by the Decision Tree Classifier at 80.69% and the logistic regression model at 79.63%. Beyond performance evaluation, the research explored feature engineering methods to improve model interpretability and pinpoint critical factors influencing mental health. To enhance model reliability and generalizability, hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation techniques were employed. The results indicate that the proposed models are capable of effectively identifying individuals at risk for various mental health issues. Insights gained from the analysis of feature importance can provide valuable recommendations for clinicians and aid in developing future behavioral medicine strategies. Moreover, AI-based models may uncover connections between lifestyle factors and elevated stress levels. This study seeks to promote the application of AI in mental health evaluation and emphasize the advantages of data-driven methods in tackling social and health challenges.

AB  - The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has transformed traditional healthcare systems by enabling real-time monitoring, remote diagnostics, and data-driven treatment. However, security and privacy remain significant concerns for IoMT adoption due to the sensitive nature of medical data. Therefore, we propose an integrated framework leveraging blockchain and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to enable secure, intelligent, and transparent management of IoMT data. First, the traceability and tamper-proof of blockchain are used to realize the secure transaction of IoMT data, transforming the secure transaction of IoMT data into a two-stage Stackelberg game. The dual-chain architecture is used to ensure the security and privacy protection of the transaction. The main-chain manages regular IoMT data transactions, while the side-chain deals with data trading activities aimed at resale. Simultaneously, the perceptual hash technology is used to realize data rights confirmation, which maximally protects the rights and interests of each participant in the transaction. Subsequently, medical time-series data is modeled using bidirectional simple recurrent units to detect anomalies and cyberthreats accurately while overcoming vanishing gradients. Lastly, an adversarial sample generation method based on local interpretable model-agnostic explanations is provided to evaluate, secure, and improve the anomaly detection model, as well as to make it more explainable and resilient to possible adversarial attacks. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the high performance of the integrated secure data management framework leveraging blockchain and XAI, compared with the benchmarks.

AB  - Substantial technological advances and extensive accessibility of medical data such as CT scans, X-rays and MRI images, have significantly driven the growth of automated detection systems for disease diagnosis. These Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems help healthcare providers make accurate diagnoses, particularly for infectious diseases that pose potentially fatal risks to patients. Extensive research endeavors have been undertaken, employing a combination of deep learning techniques alongside chest X-rays (CXRs) and CT scan images, to address a spectrum of pulmonary disorders, including tuberculosis (TB). This research study investigates the fusion of a traditional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), specifically the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), to improve the categorisation of CXRs into tuberculosis and normal categories. The GRU’s representation learning capability is leveraged as it learns from the attributes identified by the CNN and passed on to the model. This capability plays a crucial role in our study, as it enables the model to capture sequential patterns and dependencies within the extracted features. The hypothesis is that this ability will optimize the model’s detection efficiency in identifying TB from CXRs, thereby enhancing the classification accuracy. To address the challenge of an unbalanced dataset, various data augmentation methods have been applied, followed by image enhancement techniques. Additionally, the LIME package has been utilized to obtain interpretable explanations for individual predictions by highlighting key features used by the model in classification. The proposed model achieved an impressive accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score and AUC of $\mathbf{9 8. 0 0 \%, 9 9. 4 3 \%, \mathbf { 9 6. 6 7 \% }, \mathbf { 9 8. 0 2 \% } \ 2 0}$ and 1.0 in correctly predicting target classes. The results establish that the proposed system performs well owing to the combination of CNN with GRU, which allows for the successful extraction of complex patterns from CXRs along with the capture of temporal dependencies within the data.

AB  - This paper introduces a novel spatiotemporal feature representation model designed to address the limitations of traditional methods in multidimensional time series (MTS) analysis. The proposed approach converts MTS into one-dimensional sequences of spatially evolving events, preserving the complex coupling relationships between dimensions. By employing a variable-length tuple mining method, key spatiotemporal features are extracted, enhancing the interpretability and accuracy of time series analysis. Unlike conventional models, this unsupervised method does not rely on large training datasets, making it adaptable across different domains. Experimental results from motion sequence classification validate the model's superior performance in capturing intricate patterns within the data. The proposed framework has significant potential for applications across various fields, including backend services for monitoring and optimizing IT infrastructure, medical diagnosis through continuous patient monitoring and health trend analysis, and internet businesses for tracking user behavior and forecasting sales. This work offers a new theoretical foundation and technical support for advancing time series data mining and its practical applications in human behavior recognition and other domains.

AB  - Across sectors, from finance to healthcare, Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms are used for more and more of the decisions that shape our lives as individuals and collectively. But as the use of AI systems has exploded, there have been major questions about biases within these algorithms that can allow unfair and unethical results. In this paper, we explore these methods in identifying and remediating bias AI algorithms to achieve fairness and ethical integrity. First, we follow an investigation on the origins and nature of biases within AI: how crowdsourced biased training data pollutes developing models; injustice model assumptions account for these troubles unfortunately there are some scenarios that cannot justify collective decision-making. The study later discusses through some methods for identifying biases based on statistical analysis, bias auditing as well fairness through use of metrics. We learn a wide range of these biases (racial, gender and socioeconomic), as well how they appear in AI outputs. In order to tackle these problems, we survey several mitigation techniques including re- sampling strategies, algorithmic modifications and fairness constraints during training. We also broach transparency of accountability, and ethical standards in AI creation or deployment. It discusses the necessity of integrating ethicists, sociologists and AI researchers to enable robust bias mitigation frameworks. Using extensive-case studies and experimental evaluation, we show the efficacy of our proposed approaches in mitigating biases and improving AI fairness. This highlights the need for ongoing monitoring and iterative improvements to preserve ethical practices when using AI. In the end, this research is expected to help create fairer AI technologies that are trustworthy and serve all segments of society without reproducing or exacerbating existing inequities.

AB  - ML models are now finding extensive applications in sensitive fields such as healthcare. These models contribute significantly to diagnosis and decision-making. However, they suffer from adversarial attacks wherein small, often imperceptible, changes in input data produce undesirable outputs. Such vulnerabilities can further threaten patient safety and privacy. We conduct this study to interpret adversarial attack impact in CNN model using Grad-CAM. Grad-CAM is a tool that visualizes the model’s decision making through highlighting parts of an input image that influence its predictions. We have used SqueezeNet model, a lightweight convolutional network for the classification of ophthalmic images which includes 4 classes - normal, cataract, diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma. We then subjected our model to four standard attacks: the Fast Gradient Sign Method, Projected Gradient Descent, Basic Iterative method and Carlini Wagner attack. Our experiments show that each attack heavily distorts the attentions induced in the model by Grad-CAM, and it, in turn, produces incorrect classifications. Therefore, such findings emphasize the need for developing stronger ML models as well as the utility of interpretability tools in explaining and countering adversarial threats. Future work will comprise integration of insights provided by Grad-CAM together with better detection systems to enhance the resilience of the model.

AB  - Medical image classification plays a crucial role in diagnostic decision-making, demanding robust methodologies to extract meaningful features and enhance accuracy. In this study, we present a novel hybrid approach designed to optimize medical image classification by seamlessly integrating advanced image processing and deep learning techniques. The proposed framework commences with a pre-processing stage, where a synergistic combination of wavelet and Gaussian filters is applied to refine image quality. Subsequently, Otsu thresholding is employed for segmentation, enhancing the discriminative potential of the processed images. To extract critical features, the Lion Optimization Algorithm is introduced, providing an innovative means to optimize feature selection. This optimization contributes to improved feature representation, capturing intricate patterns essential for accurate image categorization. The core of the proposed approach lies in the integration of these processed and optimized features into a Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) architecture. The CNN-LSTM model effectively captures spatial and temporal dependencies within the data, facilitating more nuanced and accurate classification. Experimental evaluations on benchmark medical image datasets demonstrate the superiority of the hybrid approach over traditional methods, achieving heightened classification accuracy and interpretability. The proposed framework showcases advancements in medical image analysis and contributes to the ongoing efforts to bridge the gap between image processing and deep learning methodologies. Our approach holds significant promise for enhancing diagnostic capabilities and decision support in medical imaging, ultimately im-proving patient care and healthcare outcomes.

This study examines CNN's medical picture categorization performance. This study used X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, and histopathology slides. Traditional CNNs, transfer learning models, and bespoke networks were constructed and trained. The training data included lung ailments, cancer detection, bone fractures, and neurological disorders. Our investigations showed that CNNs can extract complex characteristics from medical photos, improving classification accuracy. Transfer learning, where pre-trained models were fine-tuned on medical data, performed well with 94.8% accuracy. We used cutting-edge data augmentation and attention strategies to improve model generalization and interpretability. In addition to high classification accuracy, we studied model explainability using gradient-based methods and visualization to highlight medical picture regions of relevance that influenced model predictions. Building trust with medical practitioners and understanding deep learning model decision-making requires interpretability. In clinical settings, CNN deployment raises ethical and practical issues such as data privacy, model robustness, and regulatory compliance.

AB  - This research aims to develop machine learning (ML) models for the early identification of diabetes, a chronic condition that presents considerable global health threats, including heart disease, kidney failure, and neuropathy. Conventional diagnostic techniques, such as fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and HbA1c tests, tend to be invasive and often recognize the illness only in its advanced stages. To tackle this issue, the study investigates a range of ML algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, AdaBoost, Naive Bayes, and XGBoost. It also incorporates comprehensive data preprocessing methods like feature scaling and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling (SMOTE). The goal of these initiatives is to improve the models’ performance and interpretability to facilitate earlier diagnosis. Among the models assessed, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and AdaBoost stood out, both achieving an accuracy of 0.7727, with XGBoost following closely at $\mathbf{0 . 7 6 6 2}$. After tuning, Support Vector Machines (SVM) showed a significant improvement, reaching an accuracy of 0.85, while KNN achieved an accuracy of 0.87 on the test set. Although Decision Trees and Naive Bayes performed less effectively, this research highlights the necessity of model interpretability in clinical settings. Techniques such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) are utilized to elucidate predictions. The implementation of these models on a web-based platform using flask framework which allows for real-time assessments of diabetes risk and insights into critical risk factors, aiding healthcare providers and patients in making better-informed decisions.

AB  - Accurate prediction of medical conditions with straight past clinical evidence is a long-sought topic in the medical management and health insurance field. Although great progress has been made with machine learning algorithms, the medical community is still skeptical about the model accuracy and interpretability. This paper presents an innovative hierarchical attention deep learning model to achieve better prediction and clear interpretability that can be easily understood by medical professionals. This paper developed an Interpretable Hierarchical Attention Network (IHAN). IHAN uses a hierarchical attention structure that matches naturally with the medical history data structure and reflects patients' encounter (date of service) sequence. The model attention structure consists of 3 levels: (1) attention on the medical code types (diagnosis codes, procedure codes, lab test results, and prescription drugs), (2) attention on the sequential medical encounters within a type, (3) attention on the individual medical codes within an encounter and type. This model is applied to predict the occurrence of stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD), using three years' medical history of Medicare Advantage (MA) members from an American nationwide health insurance company. The model takes members' medical events, both claims and Electronic Medical Records (EMR) data, as input, makes a prediction of stage 3 CKD and calculates contribution from individual events to the predicted outcome.

AB  - Interpretability has become a crucial component in the Machine Learning (ML) domain. This is particularly important in the context of medical and health applications, where the underlying reasons behind how an ML model makes a certain decision are as important as the decision itself for the experts. However, interpreting an ML model based on limited local data may potentially lead to inaccurate conclusions. On the other hand, centralized decision making and interpretability, by transferring the data to a centralized server, may raise privacy concerns due to the sensitivity of personal/medical data in such applications.In this paper, we propose a federated interpretability scheme based on SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) value and DeepLIFT (Deep Learning Important FeaTures) to interpret ML models, without sharing sensitive data and in a privacy-preserving fashion. Our proposed federated interpretability scheme is a decentralized framework for interpreting ML models, where data remains on local devices, and only values that do not directly describe the raw data are aggregated in a privacy-preserving fashion to interpret the model.

AB  - Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a versatile tool applicable in autonomous vehicles for manufacturing use cases up to recommendation platforms for e-commerce, thus greatly increasing process efficiency, sophistication of decisions, and user engagement. One area that stands out is healthcare, where this could revolutionize diagnostic procedures and patient comprehension, which will help patients at large readings more effectively. Reduced convergence time and enhanced interpretability because solution paths are directly enforced through constraints. Coherent question answers are difficult to form, yet, remain a key challenge. In this work, we present a framework for knowledge-based VQA utilizing answer heuristics. Then, two types of answer heuristics are presented: answer candidates and answer-aware examples. Answer candidates and also answer-aware examples with the same answer as the test input, which was a downside as well as a limitation in our benchmark were currently provided which were aimed to make our experiment extra straightforward. Our proposed MedVQA version with CLIP-based visual attributes along with BERT to enhance the MCAN model was able to increase the model to an accuracy of 78.89% (11.09+) over the current state-of-the-art. This is a significant development, proving that state-of-the-art models and visualization elements lead to improved system performance. The original framework intended to facilitate adoption and thereby improve healthcare decision-making and patient outcomes.

AB  - Knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) is concerned with progress in data analysis tools. Data mining is a crucial parts of the KDD process. Data mining is a method for discovering and extracting patterns from huge medical datasets. There are a number of benefits to using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm in healthcare systems. SVM is a strong and flexible machine learning algorithm that may excel at certain healthcare analytics applications. SVM is preferred in healthcare systems because of their adaptability, ability to manage imbalanced datasets, feature interpretability, handling of high-dimensional data, handling of classification, predictive modeling tasks, handling of non-linear relationships, resistance to overfitting and provision of a distinct margin of separation. It is essential to carefully consider the unique needs and features of the healthcare application when choosing an algorithm. Healthcare systems that use SVM algorithms do so with the intention of capitalizing on SVM's capabilities to tackle domain-specific problems and tasks. In light of this development, the relevant literature on this topic with regard to approach, SVM algorithm, and outcomes are surveyed. The publications evaluated in this study have been categorized according to their relevance to the disciplines, models, tasks, and approaches discussed. Data mining is the practice of sifting through massive amounts of unstructured data for meaningful patterns and insights. Results show 90% accuracy and 98% precision and F measures of the given medical dataset.

AB  - Early detection and prevention of breast cancer are vital for improving patient outcomes and reducing mortality rates. Machine learning algorithms, coupled with principal component analysis (PCA), offer a promising approach for enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of breast cancer diagnosis. This paper proposes a novel approach to early breast cancer detection, combining machine learning algorithms, including support vector machines, neural networks, and random forests, with PCA. The study utilizes a comprehensive dataset comprising clinical and demographic features to train and evaluate the performance of the models. Results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in accurately identifying breast cancer at its early stages, thus enabling timely intervention and improved patient care. Furthermore, the integration of PCA aids in reducing dimensionality and enhancing the interpretability of the models thereby is facilitating more effective decision-making in clinical settings. Overall, this research underscores the potential of machine learning algorithms with PCA in revolutionizing breast cancer detection and prevention strategies, ultimately contributing to better healthcare outcomes and patient wellbeing. In this study we have applied five ML technique: Logistic Regression, Decision tree, Random forest, Naïve byes and support vector machine on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic dataset. The evaluation of classification outcomes was conducted both with and without the implementation of PCA. Notably, upon applying PCA, the random forest classifier emerged as the top performer, surpassing all other classifiers. Impressively, it attained an accuracy rate of 99.8%, showcasing its superior performance in the dataset.

AB  - Summary <p>Fuzzy logic is characterized by relevant features, such as model interpretability and the capability of dealing with uncertain or heterogeneous data, which make it particularly suitable for the definition of mathematical models in the field of biomedical sciences. We describe here two different modeling approaches, based on a knowledge&#x2010;driven or data&#x2010;driven strategy, that we previously developed and applied for the definition, simulation and analysis of fuzzy inference systems and fuzzy networks. To showcase their benefit in biomedical sciences, we show three applications related to: (i) the determination of minimal drug combinations to induce apoptotic death in cancer cells, (ii) the analysis of oscillatory regimes in signal transduction pathways, and (iii) the assessment of tremor severity in a neurological disorder. These models are characterized by a high level of interpretability &#x2013; thanks to the use of linguistic terms, fuzzy sets, and fuzzy rules written in human&#x2010;comprehensible language &#x2013; making their application suitable in real&#x2010;world scenarios.</p>

AB  - In the wake of COVID-19, rising monkeypox cases pose a potential pandemic threat. While less severe than COVID-19, its increasing spread underscores the urgency of early detection and isolation to control the disease. The main difficulty in diagnosing monkeypox arises from its prolonged diagnostic process and symptoms that are similar to those of other skin diseases, making early detection and isolation challenging. To address this, the deployment of deep learning models on edge devices presents a viable solution for the rapid and accurate detection of monkeypox. However, the resource constraints of edge devices require the use of lightweight deep learning models. The limitation of these models often involves a trade-off with accuracy, which is unacceptable in the context of medical diagnostics. Therefore, the development of optimized deep learning models that are both resource-efficient for edge computing and highly accurate becomes imperative. To this end, an attention-based MobileNetV2 model for monkeypox detection, capitalizing on the inherent lightweight design of MobileNetV2 for effective deployment on edge devices, is proposed. This model, enhanced with both spatial and channel attention mechanisms, is tailored for rapid and early-stage diagnosis of monkeypox with better accuracy. We significantly improved the Monkeypox Skin Images Dataset (MSID) by incorporating a broader range of classes for similar skin diseases, thereby substantially enriching and diversifying the training dataset. This helps better distinguish monkeypox from other similar skin diseases, particularly in its early stages or when a detailed medical examination is unavailable. To ensure transparency and interpretability, we incorporated Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) to provide clear insights into the model’s diagnostic reasoning. Finally, to comprehensively assess the performance of our model, we employed a range of evaluation metrics, including Cohen’s Kappa, Matthews Correlation Coefficient, and Youden’s J Index, alongside traditional measures like accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall, sensitivity, and specificity. The attention-based MobileNetV2 model demonstrated impressive results, outperforming the baseline models by achieving 92.28% accuracy in the extended MSID dataset, 98.19% in the original MSID dataset, and 93.33% in the Monkeypox Skin Lesion Dataset (MSLD) dataset.

AB  - Organoids replicate key aspects of organ function and present a microcosmic representation of the in-vivo state, offering unprecedented opportunities for disease modeling, drug testing, and personalized medicine. However, the complexity of these heterogeneous biological models requires innovative approaches to optimize the analysis and monitoring. This work outlines an Intelligent Cyber-Biological System (ICBS) with a multi-layered MAPE-K structure for enhanced analysis and real-time organoid monitoring. Starting with the Laboratory Layer, the ICBS harnesses real-time data from organoid cultures, which the Data Layer processes and archives for insight extraction. The Intelligence Layer employs advanced machine learning (ML) models for pattern recognition and predictive analytics, identifying critical development stages and treatment responses. In the Decision Layer, perceptions derived from ML-generated guide strategic decision-making for culture condition adjustments and further examinations. The ICBS framework engages researchers in its findings, fostering decision implementation and a responsive feedback system. Its real-world application in the intestinal organoid case study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed solution, increasing the efficiency of experimental processes and the predictive accuracy of treatment outcomes.

AB  - COVID-19, a respiratory illness caused by SARS-CoV-2, has brought attention to a common symptom: loss of smell and taste. Anosmia, a prevalent symptom of COVID-19, varies in severity from mild to severe, necessitating accurate diagnostic tools. The study proposes a novel framework for predicting COVID-19 anosmia severity utilizing YOLOv8 for classification and EigenCAM for interpretability. YOLOv8, optimized for object detection, is adapted for classification tasks using advanced architectural enhancements and mosaic augmentation. EigenCAM provides interpretability by highlighting image regions crucial for predictions, aiding clinical decision-making. Evaluation across multiple YOLOv8 model sizes using DTI and FLAIR modalities reveals robust performance, with the Large model excelling in DTI and the Nano model in FLAIR. Compared to our previous work, the framework significantly enhances accuracy and interpretability in predicting anosmia severity, marking a substantial advancement in medical image analysis. This study underscores the potential of deep learning for precise and interpretable medical diagnostics, offering insights into anosmia severity prediction.

Our study introduces a multi-class skin cancer classification (MSCC) system employing deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and interpretable deep learning frameworks. This approach enhances accuracy and speed, providing clear, understandable visual explanations. By addressing challenges like feature extraction from irregular, artifactladen images and improving generalization and interpretability, this system promises to significantly aid in early detection, thus saving lives and reducing the strain on healthcare professionals. The effectiveness of the proposed model is assessed using the ISIC-2018 and ISIC-2019 datasets for skin imaging. The model successfully distinguishes between seven types of skin lesions-benign ker-atosis lesions, melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, melanocytic nevi, vascular lesions, actinic keratosis, and dermatofibroma-with high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, all averaging at 96.37%, 96.39%, 96.35%, and 96.36%, respectively. To delve deeper into the model's predictions, we employ the local in-terpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) framework and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values. These techniques generate visual explanations aligned with prior beliefs and adhere to best practices for general explanations. The incorporation of explainability enhances the model's utility in real clinical scenarios.

AB  - Malaria is a disease that can be fatal, and it is spread through the bite of the female Anopheles mosquito. The life of the sufferer is put in jeopardy as a result of the presence of numerous plasmodium parasites, which spread throughout their blood cells. Malaria can potentially be fatal if it is not treated within the first few stages of the disease. A well-known method for diagnosing malaria, microscopy involves taking blood samples from the patient, calculating the number of parasites, and counting the victim's red blood cells. Nevertheless, the procedure of microscopy takes a lot of time, and, in certain circumstances, it can produce an incorrect result. When compared to the more conventional approach of microscopic examination, the recent successes of deep learning (DL) in the field of medical diagnosis make it quite conceivable to reduce the expenses associated with the diagnosis while simultaneously improving overall detection accuracy. This study proposes a transformer-based DL technique for diagnosing the malaria parasite using blood cell images. An explainable AI technique called Grad-CAM was applied in order to determine which aspects of an image the proposed model paid significantly more attention to in comparison to the other aspects of the image through saliency mapping. This was done in order to demonstrate the usefulness of the models. According to the findings of this research, the performance of the vision transformer and the VGG16 are identical. Both models have reached an accuracy score of approximately 96 %, which is very impressive.

AB  - In the field of drug discovery, a proliferation of pre-trained models has surfaced, exhibiting exceptional performance across a variety of tasks. However, the extensive size of these models, coupled with the limited interpretative capabilities of current fine-tuning methods, impedes the integration of pre-trained models into the drug discovery process. This paper pushes the boundaries of pre-trained models in drug discovery by designing a novel fine-tuning paradigm known as the Head Feature Parallel Adapter (HFPA), which is highly interpretable, high-performing, and has fewer parameters than other widely used methods. Specifically, this approach enables the model to consider diverse information across representation subspaces concurrently by strategically using Adapters, which can operate directly within the model's feature space. Our tactic freezes the backbone model and forces various small-size Adapters' corresponding subspaces to focus on exploring different atomic and chemical bond knowledge, thus maintaining a small number of trainable parameters and enhancing the interpretability of the model. Moreover, we furnish a comprehensive interpretability analysis, imparting valuable insights into the chemical area. HFPA outperforms over seven physiology and toxicity tasks and achieves state-of-the-art results in three physical chemistry tasks. We also test ten additional molecular datasets, demonstrating the robustness and broad applicability of HFPA.

AB  - Chronic kidney cancer (CKC) is a real-world example of a crucial class of frontiers that are behind basic medical diagnostics and have a significant worldwide impact. For this reason, we need to evaluate more sophisticated prediction algorithms. In order to balance the previously proven CKC detection, this research has presented a novel strategy that combines ensemble approaches with robust machine learning. We employ nine alternative algorithms three from each of Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Light Gradient Boosting Machine in addition to the standard predictive models for this specific stacking ensemble. We obtained an accuracy of 99.19% after preprocessing the data and using collaboration for feature selection. Our model performs with excellent predictive power, similar to Random Forests, but with the ease of de-biasing and good interpretability of Decision Trees. Additionally, as a mixed category, the ensemble performs better than any one model on all performance criteria (precision, recall, and F1 score). In order to enhance individual risk prediction of CKC and intervention execution, this adaptable framework is therefore ideal for use in clinical settings. Let’s put it this way: our study is a significant step toward improving CKC diagnosis, and it provides a foundation for the broader application of ensemble models of learning in healthcare, which might revolutionize patient care in all specializations.

AB  - In this study, we present a novel approach for predicting interventions for patients in the intensive care unit using a multivariate time series graph convolutional neural network. Our method addresses two critical challenges: the need for timely and accurate decisions based on changing physiological signals, drug administration information, and static characteristics; and the need for interpretability in the decision-making process. Drawing on real-world ICU records from the MIMIC-III dataset, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves upon existing machine learning and deep learning methods for predicting two targeted interventions, mechanical ventilation and vasopressors. Our model achieved an accuracy improvement from 81.6% to 91.9% and a F1 score improvement from 0.524 to 0.606 for predicting mechanical ventilation interventions. For predicting vasopressor interventions, our model achieved an accuracy improvement from 76.3% to 82.7% and a F1 score improvement from 0.509 to 0.619. We also assessed the interpretability by performing an adjacency matrix importance analysis, which revealed that our model uses clinically meaningful and appropriate features for prediction. This critical aspect can help clinicians gain insights into the underlying mechanisms of interventions, allowing them to make more informed and precise clinical decisions. Overall, our study represents a significant step forward in the development of decision support systems for ICU patient care, providing a powerful tool for improving clinical outcomes and enhancing patient safety.

AB  - Timely and precise identification and categorization of lung cancer are crucial for improving patient survival rates. Although diagnostic technologies have made progress, the complex characteristics of malignant tumors provide considerable difficulties in analyzing lung images. In this study, a groundbreaking approach is introduced, merging the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) with the VGG-19 deep learning framework to effectively address these complexities. The model, trained on the varied lung imaging data from the IQ-OTH/NCCD dataset, has exceptional performance in precisely recognizing, predicting, and pinpointing lung cancer symptoms. The VGG-19 model is utilized because of its extensive capacity to extract intricate information from pictures, accurately identifying possible cancers. After extracting the data, ANFIS utilizes a fuzzy logic framework to analyze these features, enabling a detailed identification of cancer patterns that enhances both accuracy and interpretability. This technique combines the advanced capabilities of neural networks with the valuable insights of fuzzy logic, establishing a new standard for accuracy in medical diagnoses. The results of our research show considerable improvements in important diagnostic measures, such as accuracy in classifying, reliability in predicting, and precision in locating. These advancements represent a major progress compared to current diagnostic methods, and underscore the transformative potential of integrating AI with traditional medical imaging techniques.

Good accuracy is not enough for skin cancer predictions. Understanding the model's behavior is crucial for clinical application and reliable outcomes. In this work, we identify desiderata for explanations in skin-lesion models. We analyzed seven methods, four based on pixel-attribution (Grad-CAM, Score-CAM, LIME, SHAP) and three high-level concepts (ACE, ICE, CME), for a deep neural network trained on the International Skin Imaging Collaboration Archive. Our findings indicate that while these techniques reveal biases, there is room for improving the comprehensiveness of explanations to achieve transparency in skin-lesion models.

AB  - Over recent years conventional pattern recognition pattern recognition techniques have advanced significantly. Nonetheless, these methods heavily depend on manual feature extraction, potentially limiting the overall performance and generalizability of the model. Given the rising prominence and efficiency of deep learning approaches, there has been a growing interest in leveraging these methods for human action recognition in mobile and wearable computing contexts. Despite this enthusiasm, existing deep learning architectures may not fully capitalize on the complex spatio-temprial patterns inherent in human actions. Moreover, deploying deep learning models in real-world scenarios often demands robustness, efficiency, and interpretability, which remain significant challenges. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel approach: a deep neural network that integrates convolutional layers with long short-term memory(LSTM) units. By fusing the strengths of CNNs in spatial feature extraction with the temporal modelling capabilities of LSTMs, our hybrid architecture aims to enhance the accuracy and robustness of human activity recognition systems. This fusion enables the model to automatically learn hierarchical representations from data, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering. The approach holds, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering. The approach holds promise for applications in healthcare, sports analysis and assistive technology, where accurate and reliable HAR is essential. Overall, The proposed model achieves accuracy of 80% and 92% on the UCF50 dataset, a comprehensive video dataset, utilizing the CNN and LSTM models individually, respectively. These findings indicate that our hybrid model exhibits superior robustness and enhanced activity detection capabilities compared to certain previously reported results of only sensor data, surpassing an 90% accuracy threshold when trained on video-based data. Notably, the model demonstrates adaptability in extracting activity features whie maintaining a streamlined parameter count and achieving heightened.

AB  - The growing application of machine learning (ML) techniques in healthcare has led to increased interest in federated learning (FL), which enables the secure and private training of robust ML models. However, conventional FL methods often fall short of providing adequate privacy protection and face challenges in handling non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) training data. These shortcomings are of significant concern when employing FL in electronic devices in healthcare. To address these issues, we propose an Auditable Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning (AP2FL) model tailored for electronics in healthcare settings. By leveraging Trusted Execution Environments (TEE), AP2FL ensures secure training and aggregation processes on both client and server sides, effectively mitigating data leakage risks. To manage Non-IID data within the proposed framework, we incorporate the Active Personalized Federated Learning (ActPerFL) model and Batch Normalization (BN) techniques to consolidate user updates and identify data similarities. Additionally, we introduce an auditing mechanism in AP2FL that reveals the contribution of each client to the FL process, facilitating the updating of the global model following diverse data types and distributions. In other words, it ensures the FL process’s integrity, transparency, fairness, and robustness. Our results demonstrate that the proposed AP2FL model outperforms existing methods in accuracy and effectively eliminates privacy leakage.

AB  - Human action recognition(HAR) enables the detection and classification of human movements, supporting real-time applications such as surveillance, healthcare monitoring, gesture recognition, hazard avoidance, and sports analysis. However, HAR using still images is challenging due to the lack of temporal information, which makes capturing dynamic actions and distinguishing similar activities difficult. Despite these limitations, we successfully developed a robust HAR model using still images by carefully implementing deep learning techniques. We created an image classification model utilizing transfer learning with EfficientNetB7 to classify human actions into 15 categories based on still images. The model is trained and evaluated on a dataset containing over 12,600 labeled images covering various human activities.

AB  - Brain stroke remains a leading cause of death and long-term disability globally, necessitating early and accurate diagnosis to improve patient outcomes. Current diagnostic models frequently lack in both performance and interpretability, which restricts their usefulness in clinical settings. This study presents a sophisticated predictive modelling system that combines SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) with XGBoost to improve the accuracy of brain stroke diagnosis. The proposed system utilizes datasets from Kaggle, implementing thorough data preprocessing and feature selection using LASSO regularization. XGBoost, renowned for its resilience and exceptional efficiency, is employed for the purpose of model training. The evaluation metrics indicate that the system has achieved exceptional performance, with a precision of 0.92, recall of 0.90, F1-score of 0.91, MAE of 0.08, RMSE of 0.18, and R2 of 0.84. Our approach surpasses classic models such as GBM and Random Forests in terms of accuracy and interpretability. Our technique, which emphasizes both performance and transparency, is well-suited for clinical applications. It represents a substantial improvement over current diagnostic models and contributes to the early and precise identification of brain strokes. This novel approach holds the potential to propel the field of medical diagnostics forward and enhance patient care results.

AB  - The ubiquity of neural networks (NNs) in real-world applications, from healthcare to natural language processing, underscores their immense utility in capturing complex relationships within high-dimensional data. However, NNs come with notable disadvantages, such as their ”black-box” nature, which hampers interpretability, as well as their tendency to overfit the training data. We introduce a novel method for learning interpretable differentiable logic networks (DLNs) that are architectures that employ multiple layers of binary logic operators. We train these networks by softening and differentiating their discrete components, e.g., through binarization of inputs, binary logic operations, and connections between neurons. This approach enables the use of gradient-based learning methods. Experimental results on twenty classification tasks indicate that differentiable logic networks can achieve accuracies comparable to or exceeding that of traditional NNs. Equally importantly, these networks offer the advantage of interpretability. Moreover, their relatively simple structure results in the number of logic gate-level operations during inference being up to ten thousand times smaller than NNs, making them suitable for deployment on edge devices.

AB  - Decentralized applications (Dapps), based on smart contract technology, have been increasingly applied in various fields such as healthcare, industrial IoT, agriculture, financial services, supply chain management, and insurance. In certain complex business scenarios, blockchain may require machine learning models to assist contract business. However, on-chain computations are often costly and slow, and there are limitations on contract size. Due to the transparency of on-chain data, there are also privacy concerns regarding user data during model training and inference. To address these challenges, we propose a trusted off-chain machine learning solution that integrates ZK-SNARK and Oracle technologies. Following the principle of “off-chain computation, on-chain verification”,our approach leverages ZK-SNARK to delegate the computation tasks of machine learning models to a trusted environment under the Oracle off-chain server. This solution significantly reduces the computational costs of the blockchain. User data and models are executed off-chain, effectively safeguarding user privacy. The execution results generate zero-knowledge proofs returned for on-chain verification. We have implemented TOMLS-ZKSO and conducted relevant experiments on insurance contract business on the Chainmaker. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with model proof generation taking approximately 0.4 seconds and Dapp response time around 0.52 seconds.

AB  - This chapter delves into the nuanced process of optimizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for univariate time series forecasting, an area of critical importance in predictive analytics, spanning various industries, including finance, healthcare, and energy. While CNN models are traditionally celebrated for their prowess in image and spatial data analysis, adapting them for univariate time series data - characterized by sequential observations of a single variable - presents unique challenges and avenues for exploration. The discussion begins with an insightful overview of CNN architectures, underscoring their adaptability in capturing temporal patterns and dependencies through the application of convolutional filters to time series data. Following this, the text investigates the methodologies for tailoring CNNs to the specific demands of univariate forecasting tasks. This includes a thorough examination of data preprocessing techniques, architectural modifications to suit time series analysis, hyperparameter optimization strategies, and the incorporation of regularization techniques to enhance model precision while preventing overfitting. A significant contribution of this research is the formulation of an exhaustive framework for deploying and critically evaluating CNN models, bolstered by empirical analysis on real-world datasets to verify the proposed adjustments’ efficacy. Comparative performance evaluations reveal the superiority of meticulously optimized CNN models against traditional forecasting methods and generic neural network architectures. This article is intended to serve as a definitive guide for both practitioners and researchers seeking to leverage the sophisticated predictive power of CNNs for univariate time series forecasting, providing detailed instructions for the careful development, assessment, and implementation of these models.

AB  - Theory of Mind (ToM) is the ability to attribute mental states to others, an important component of human cognition. At present, there has been growing interest in the artificial intelligence (AI) with cognitive abilities, for example in healthcare and the motoring industry. Research indicates that infants exhibit early signs in cognitive and social understanding, including some basic abilities related to beliefs, desires, and intentions (BDIs). Thus, the ability to attribute BDIs to others is also crucial for the development of machine ToM. In this article, we review recent progress in machine ToM on BDIs. And we shall introduce the experiments, datasets, and methods of machine ToM on these three aspects, summarize the development of different tasks and datasets in recent years, and compare well-behaved models in aspects of advantages, limitations, and applicable conditions, hoping that this study can guide researchers to quickly keep up with latest trend in this field. Unlike other domains with a specific task and resolution framework, machine ToM lacks a unified instruction and a series of standard evaluation tasks, which make it difficult to formally compare the proposed models. And the existing models still cannot exhibit the same ToM reasoning ability as real humans, lack of transferability, interpretability, few-shot learning, etc. We argue that, one method to address this difficulty is now to present a standard assessment criteria and dataset, better a large-scale dataset covered multiple aspects of ToM. Besides, for developing an AI of ToM, it requires the cooperation of experts from various domains.

AB  - Among the main motivations of making forecasts on water quality, related needs are identified in public health management and environment. A novel hybrid approach can be described as combining ensemble approaches with deep learning to improve the prediction capability. In fact, it is the integration of Random Forest ensemble with Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory network, which subsequently allows spatial and temporal trends within water-quality data to be incorporated. In this, the model was trained over a large dataset of water samples originating from various sources, with considerable water quality indicators. Our hybrid methodology shows higher predication accuracy along with robustness compared to the traditional classic techniques associated with approaches of machine learning. The ConvLSTM part of the model is efficient for handling complex temporal dependencies and overfitting of the random forest ensemble improves the generalization and interpretability of the model. Observably, from the feature importance analysis, pH and dissolved oxygen are the most critical measurements associated with water quality. The architecture proposed covers real-time data collection, preprocessing, two-stage pipeline of the prediction with data augmentation besides the hyperparameter optimization techniques. The results of the above architecture show appreciable improvements in both computational efficiency and the predictions' accuracy. In the process, the contribution advances a discipline that provides more flexible and reliable frameworks for predicting water quality, likely to find application in early warning systems and well-informed policy-making for the sustainable management of water resources.

The research underscores the imperative for artificial intelligence systems to be dependable and secure on a global scale. Our investigation encompasses transfer, white-box, and black-box attacks on generative models to provide a comprehensive understanding. Crucially, this entails exploring autoregressive models, generative adversarial networks, and variational autoencoders as potential modeling avenues. We delve into how these threats impact the resilience of generative models and their practical utility. Employing robust optimization techniques, architectural refinements, and adversarial training, we endeavor to fortify generative models against adversarial influences. These strategies represent advancements in the robustness of generative models. Numerous adjustments are underway to enhance the system's ability to withstand external influences. We aim to enhance the efficiency and dependability of deep learning systems by bolstering their resilience against malicious incursions. Strengthening the system's defences against unauthorized access could contribute significantly to this objective. We aspire to elevate fairness, transparency, and accountability in AI-guided decision-making by integrating ethical AI principles into the creation and utilization of generative models. This effort propels the advancement of artificial intelligence, potentially fostering the development of more dependable and secure systems.

This work aims at training and testing various machine learning approaches for predicting these relations, as well as considering various datasets, and their integration involving multi-omics data. The process of data collection has been carried out from Genomic, Transcriptomic, and Clinical data stored in various data repositories and then preprocessed for feature selection and fine-tuning of the model along with the development of Supervised, Unsupervised, and Integrated Models. The models were built and tested using cross-validated data sets; model efficiency was assessed with respect to accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score. The findings showed that the models from the second group of hybrids obtained a systematically higher accuracy than models from the first and subsequent groups, especially when analyzing multiple types of ‘omics data at once. Similar deployments on entirely separate datasets ensured the model’s reliability and portability across different contexts. Furthermore, interpretability features and visualization modules were included into the software to improve assessment and interactivity for users and scholars. This research will be beneficial for the field of genomics since it proposes tools that will help in the better understanding of disease and the identification of genes involved in particular diseases, making it possible to start the process of targeting important genes in order to develop cures for such diseases.

AB  - Tuberculosis is one among the major health burdens across the globe, especially in developing regions. It is an infectious disease that is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, generally affecting the lungs, though it may spread to other organs if not cured. Early diagnosis of TB is very important for receiving effective treatment and, as such, control the spread. In this work, the authors develop a CNN model to classify chest X-rays into two classes: TB-positive and TB-negative. The dataset had 4,200 labeled chest X-ray images. Of those, 3,500 were from patients without tuberculosis and 700 were from diagnosed TB patients. This dataset also trained the CNN and further validated it to result in an overall accuracy of 97%. The model performed with a precision of 0.99, a recall of 0.99, and F1-score of 0.99 for the TB-negative class, while for the TB-positive class the model performed at a precision of 0.96, recall of 0.94, and F1-score of 0.95. This points to very high performance of the model for both classes, with a weighted average F1-score of 0.98. These findings indeed show that CNN-based diagnosis for tuberculosis using X-ray images holds promise as an ancillary tool for healthcare professionals, particularly in resource-constrained settings. It also points to the potential of machine learning to improve diagnostic precision and reduce the burden of TB by way of early detection.

AB  - The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 disease patients differs greatly depending on their demographic and clinical history. The sudden deterioration of some patients requires prompt early detection to reduce mortality. We demonstrate that a Long-Short Term Memory deep learning approach can predict effectively the risk of SARS-CoV-2 patients developing critical illness based on historical clinical data. In this study, we developed this model using a cohort of 2301 patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 using RT-qPCR from February-May 2020. The patients are from several medical centers of Community of Madrid (Hospitales de Madrid del grupo HM Hospitales). The developed model achieves a f1-score of 92.29% and accuracy of 95.94%. In addition, we include model explainability by analyzing robustness to perturbations, feature importance using Shapley’s additive exPlanning technique, and transparency metrics and visualizations to improve the reliability of the AI system and achieve early adoption by clinicians. To provide a clinical tool to the end user we also created an online application for early assessment of patients’ risk of serious illness. This proposed rapid response methodology enables efficient allocation of healthcare resources and addresses some pandemic-related challenges.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence, as an aid to medical image interpretation has marked a significant advantage for improving diagnostic accuracy and aiding the clinical workflow. However, an issue that needs to be addressed is the "black box" nature of AI models, which makes them not very trusted or adoptable at a clinical level. This research focuses on the role of interpretable AI models with respect to being implementable within clinical workflows for influencing medical image interpretation. The study has trained and finalized the advanced deep learning architectures that includes VGG19, MobileNet as well InceptionResnetV2 to classify data of chest X-ray modalities using 13 distinct diseases labelled in multilabel classification problem. Several ensemble methods have been used to boost the prediction like Max Vote, HardVote, Simple Average and Weighted Average. The system evaluates accuracy, loss plots, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) scores. The results depicted the performance of VGG19 and MobileNet with 88.5% validation accuracies and their respective validation losses as 0.29 and 0.29. Attention layers and Grad-CAM will further ensure more explainability, thus instilling confidence in AI-driven decisions. This transparency is very key to the practical application of AI in healthcare and will lead to better patient outcomes, further optimizing clinical processes. This work potentially opens the door for wider AI deployment in clinical diagnostics by opening two major impediments: challenges in interpretability and transparency.

AB  - Advances in Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) management technologies have led to major life improvements for children and adults affected by this condition. Among other approaches, Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms play an essential role in the design process. Indeed, applications of T1D management such as Actor-Critic methods or Q-Learning have shown great success in this regard. Sometimes, however, the precise explanations behind why an agent chooses different actions requires major cognitive efforts by the end users. To address this, explainability techniques such as Decomposed Q-values (DQv), Reward Difference Explanations (RDX), and Belief Maps (BM) built via intended outcomes can help better understand the process. As such, results obtained via questionnaires and votes show that explainable RL (XRL) procedures help clarify the steps that the controller evaluates before acting. Tests were done on a benchmark dataset and then presented to 19 patients and 5 physicians. On average, users have expressed the preference towards visual explanations, such as BMs, instead of the other types of explanations analyzed. This suggests that the use of explainability for T1D management is a crucial step in obtaining better insights and increased trust towards AI systems for both patients and experts in the field.

AB  - Early detection of brain tumors is crucial for effective treatment, yet it poses a significant challenge due to the rapid nature of the disease's progression. This study explores the application of ResNet, aimed at improving the accuracy of brain tumor diagnosis in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Our model was trained on a dataset comprising 253 MRI images, which included 155 confirmed cases of tumors. The residual learning framework of ResNet effectively captures intricate features and mitigates issues such as vanishing gradients. The results indicate that the ResNet model achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 97%, surpassing traditional detection methods. We evaluated the model's performance using metrics like accuracy and F1-score, demonstrating its robustness. To improve the interpretability of our model's predictions, we utilized Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping), which highlighted critical areas in the MRI scans that influenced the model's decisions. Our findings confirm ResNet’ s effectiveness in medical imaging and stress the importance of model interpretability in healthcare, allowing radiologists to make informed diagnostic choices.

AB  - Medical imaging classifiers can achieve high predictive accuracy, but quantifying their uncertainty remains an unresolved challenge, which prevents their deployment in medical clinics. We present an algorithm that can modify any classifier to produce a prediction set containing the true label with a user-specified probability, such as 90%. We train a network to predict an instance-based version of the Conformal Prediction threshold. The threshold is then conformalized to ensure the required coverage. We applied the proposed algorithm to several standard medical imaging classification datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms current approaches in terms of smaller average size of the prediction set while maintaining the desired coverage.

AB  - Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools in medical applications, demonstrating signifi-cant potential for analyzing vast clinical datasets, identifying patterns, and facilitating early detection of health anomalies. These capabilities are particularly relevant for detecting both individual disease onset and potential pandemic scenarios at a population level. The integration of LLMs into medical workflows could revolutionize how data-driven insights are harnessed for pandemic prediction and management, although implementing these technologies requires careful consideration of critical issues, particularly data privacy and security. This paper presents a comprehensive examination of current research at the intersection of LLMs and pandemic response, analyzing the literature from both bibliometric and medical perspectives. Through the selection of 849 publications across major databases, we provide an overview of the current state of research in this domain, identify emerging patterns from a clinical standpoint, and evaluate potential implications for future pandemic prediction. Our findings reveal significant trends in the application of LLMs to pandemic-related challenges, highlighting both opportunities and critical areas requiring further investigation, particularly in mental health impacts and early warning systems. The analysis reveals that while LLMs show promise in early detection and pattern recognition, challenges remain in data privacy, model interpretability, and the integration of diverse data sources. This research serves as a foundation for understanding how LLMs can be effectively deployed in pandemic prediction and management, while acknowledging the complexities and ethical considerations inherent in such applications.

AB  - Healthcare insurance has a frequent problem: fraudulent claims. As a result, it is not surprising that the application of machine learning techniques and analytics to investigate claim behavior is a well-established issue in the literature. Despite AI's effectiveness in detecting fraudulent actions, especially in the insurance industry, the black box aspect of AI models raises serious concerns. These models frequently lack clarity, making it impossible to determine the significance of each feature in the final conclusion. This opacity serves as both a barrier and an opportunity for fraudsters, who are constantly adapting their techniques to avoid discovery. Transparency is especially important in the context of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which requires explanations for choices made using automated processing. This paper argues for the need of understanding what the model learns and how to improve it, emphasizing that customers have the right to know the outcome of machine predictions as well as the logic behind them. The study seeks to investigate answers to these difficulties, opening the way for more visible, explainable, and accountable usage of AI in insurance fraud detection. This study investigated the use of S-LIME, a model-agnostic explanation technique, to identify influential features within various models. Even with a substantial reduction in features, an increase in model accuracy by 1 % can still be achieved in XGBoost, or the accuracy can remain unchanged as observed in Random Forest. This analysis revealed that S- LIME successfully pinpoints features with a greater impact on prediction.

AB  - Smoking has a serious complicated impact on Cardiovascular Health (CVH), which makes it an easily controlled risk factor for Cardiovascular Disease (CVD). The importance of early diagnosis and treatment is crucial because of CVD, which remains to be the leading cause of morbidity and death across the globe, therefore, smoking behaviour prediction is essential. This research explores the complex relationship between smoking and CVD, and clarifies how smoking negatively impacts CVH. The first step of the analysis is removing the Not-a-Number (NaN) values in the smoking behaviour bio signals data because all NaN values are in the target column ‘smoking’, which could lead to generate biased predictions. Further, robust scaling is applied to standardize the data, where all features are on the same scale. The Random Forest feature selection technique is applied to select the most relevant features for smoking status prediction. The Borderline-Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique is used to balance the minority class with the majority class, to reduce the risk of overfitting in results. Finally, the cleaned and preprocessed data is passed to the Proposed Blending Model (PBM). In PBM, the Echo State Network and GoogleNet are placed on the base layer, and AlexNet is placed on the meta layer to make a robust smoking status prediction model. In terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score, the PBM outperforms the baseline techniques with an improvement score of 5%, 6%, 5%, and 7%, respectively. Additionally, the PBM’s results are validated through a 10-fold cross-validation method, which can increase its reliability and durability. Finally, the SHapley Additive exPlanations technique is used to understand the predictions made by the PBM. It can reveal the explainability and interpretability of the PBM. Conclusively, during the thorough simulation process, the results are collected and the ablation study is performed. The simulation results show that the early prediction of hidden smokers can help to reduce the effect of the CVDs. It also makes proactive healthcare strategies possible for better future outcomes and public health.

AB  - To understand the biological characteristics of neurological disorders with functional connectivity (FC), recent studies have widely utilized deep learning-based models to identify the disease and conducted post-hoc analyses via explainable models to discover disease-related biomarkers. Most existing frameworks consist of three stages, namely, feature selection, feature extraction for classification, and analysis, where each stage is implemented separately. However, if the results at each stage lack reliability, it can cause misdiagnosis and incorrect analysis in afterward stages. In this study, we propose a novel unified framework that systemically integrates diagnoses (i.e., feature selection and feature extraction) and explanations. Notably, we devised an adaptive attention network as a feature selection approach to identify individual-specific disease-related connections. We also propose a functional network relational encoder that summarizes the global topological properties of FC by learning the inter-network relations without pre-defined edges between functional networks. Last but not least, our framework provides a novel explanatory power for neuroscientific interpretation, also termed counter-condition analysis. We simulated the FC that reverses the diagnostic information (i.e., counter-condition FC): converting a normal brain to be abnormal and vice versa. We validated the effectiveness of our framework by using two large resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets, Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) and REST-meta-MDD, and demonstrated that our framework outperforms other competing methods for disease identification. Furthermore, we analyzed the disease-related neurological patterns based on counter-condition analysis.

We assess the performance of attention-based models on several video comprehension tasks, such as action detection, video captioning, and video summarization, using an actual case study. Compared to conventional designs, our results show that attention methods significantly improve model performance, interpretability, and generalisation possibilities. Attention-based models attain higher accuracy and resilience by dynamically paying to crucial spatial and temporal data. Attention visualisation approaches also yield important insights into the underlying decision-making processes. These empirical findings have significant implications for real-world applications where precise and comprehensible video analysis is crucial, such as healthcare, education, entertainment, and monitoring. Overall, this work highlights the revolutionary potential of deep learning's attention processes and advances the state-of-the-art in video interpretation.

AB  - The complexity and high dimensionality of healthcare data present substantial challenges in building machine learning (ML) models, given the large number of variables such as patient demographics and medical history. Effective feature selection is crucial to address issues such as increased computational resource, longer training times, overfitting, and reduced model interpretability, etc. This study evaluates a range of feature selection methods to identify the most impactful features for predicting dental expenditures using publicly available Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) data. Sixteen ML models are assessed to determine the top performing model, after which state-of-the-art filter, wrapper, embedded, and hybrid feature selection techniques are applied to optimize the feature set. The highest performance, in terms of coefficient of determination ( $R^{2}$ ), is achieved using a hybrid feature selection method that combines the mutual information filter with the embedded features from the CatBoost regressor. The results indicate that the proposed system is suitable for real-time deployment even with reduced features, providing potential benefits such as minimizing the need for irrelevant and difficult-to-obtain features. Moreover, automated feature selection significantly enhances model performance, yielding a  $R^{2}$  score of 0.86, compared to the score 0.73 achieved with carefully selected manual features. Additionally, to enhance the interpretability of the top-performing ML model, explanatory visualizations are employed to examine the influence of key features on predicting dental expenditures.

AB  - Background Information: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) continues to be a major health burden across the world and hence early detection and constant monitoring of CKD is important for proper management. Previous diagnostic methods are usually insufficient due to the uncertainty of medical data, poor scalability, and cannot process in a real time way. The coupling of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), and advanced neuro-fuzzy systems provides a transformative targeted approach to CKD management. Moreover, this study introduces a strong framework for CKD detection and prediction using Probabilistic Neuro-Fuzzy Systems integrated with Artificial Intelligence (AI) along with Temporal Fusion Net (TFN). Goals include diagnosis in real-time, scalability, and interpratabilility via the robotic IoMT automation. The framework works through feature extraction from multi-modal IoMT data followed by processing of temporal information via TFN. While Neuro-fuzzy reasoning deals with uncertainty, robotic IoMT aids in the automation of monitoring and intervention. Performance measures can be accuracy, scalability, latency and interpretability. The framework produces an accuracy of 97.5% in prognostic prediction, a reliability of 96.8% in probabilistic risk prediction, and a real-time inference time of 0.85 s In terms of scalability and interpretability, it achieves the highest data fusion efficiency (92.7%) and a higher number of IOs per each identified relationship in finer-grained abstract model representations (9.6/10) for 1,500 IoMT devices compared with representative baselines among hybrids. This framework helps to manage CKD through a fast, explainable, and scalable solution which not only improves the patient care through better CI but also enables guided personalized healthcare.

This study aims to investigate the potential integration of blockchain technology and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning models to develop a comprehensive framework that ensures secure health data sharing and effective consent management. Integrating blockchain technology's decentralized and immutable ledger with the sequential learning capabilities of LSTM presents a promising approach to tackle the various obstacles related to data integrity, provenance, and patient-centric consent within healthcare ecosystems. The proposed system aims to improve the security and transparency of health data transactions while enabling dynamic consent management. This empowers individuals to have more control over their data. In this study, aims to assess the effectiveness of the blockchain-integrated LSTM model in ensuring health data security. Additionally, the investigated model facilitates smooth and privacy-preserving collaboration among various healthcare stakeholders. The experiments involved utilizing two publicly available data sources, CICIDS-2017 and NSL-KDD. These experiments evaluated the proposed model's performance compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches within non-blockchain and blockchain settings. The results demonstrated that the proposed model exhibited superior performance across both datasets, achieving an accuracy rate of approximately 99%.

AB  - This paper surveys the latest unsupervised anomaly detection methodologies applied to health insurance fraud, covering studies from 2017 to 2024. Our review includes a variety of machine-learning approaches, evaluating their effectiveness in handling complex, high-dimensional, and imbalanced healthcare datasets. Techniques such as Isolation Forest, Bayesian hierarchical models, and deep autoencoders demonstrate superior performance compared to traditional methods. Despite significant advancements, gaps remain with regard to transfer learning, interpretability and explainability of models, and the development of real-time, incremental learning algorithms. Future research should focus on these areas to enhance fraud detection accuracy and trust. Our work aims to provide a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners, supporting the development of more robust and adaptive fraud detection systems to protect healthcare integrity and reduce financial losses.
