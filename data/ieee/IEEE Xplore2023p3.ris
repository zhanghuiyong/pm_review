The responsible and ethical use of pre-made AI is of paramount importance in this evolving technology. AI systems have the potential to impact numerous aspects of society, ranging from healthcare and finance to education and IoT. The decisions made by AI algorithms can have significant consequences for individuals, communities, and even entire industries. Using a comparison to the way widely available medicines require a prescription from medical doctors, human AI experts assume the role of evaluating, recommending, and overseeing the implementation of AI systems, even when pre-built AI solutions may seem user-friendly on the surface. The paper has explored the expanded responsibilities of human AI experts within two contemporary scenarios involving pre-made AI, encompassing LLMs and ChatGPT. These AI technologies are applied in two principal manners: initially, as standalone AI products readily accessible to a wide audience, and secondly, as elements undergoing exploration for integration into other AI-driven software and Intelligent Information Systems (IIS), with the goal of enhancing natural language processing (NLP) features within user interfaces. In all cases, the expertise of human AI professionals is indispensable, and their role is augmented. These professionals bear an increased responsibility for ensuring the responsible and ethical deployment of AI technologies, with a focus on human-centered design, bias mitigation, validation and accuracy estimation of the results, transparency promotion, and the necessary balance between automation and human oversight. This paper performs a review on pre-made AI and ChatGPT together with custom-based AI and shows that recent advance require an augmented role of human AI experts

AB  - Point-of-care Test (POCT) is the delivery of medical care at or near the patient’s bedside. Primarily employed in emergencies, where rapid diagnosis and treatment are critical, POCT is now being used in domestic telehealth solutions, as in the TiAssisto project, thanks to technological advances such as the development of portable and affordable devices, high-speed Internet connections, video conferencing, and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Ultrasound (US) images of internal organs and structures are valuable tools in POCT medicine since this examination is portable, quick, and cost-effective. USs can help diagnose different conditions, including heart problems, abdominal pain, and pneumonia. Deep learning algorithms have proven to be highly effective in image recognition, enabling physicians to make informed decisions on-site. This article presents a pipeline approach providing remarkable and reliable results to handle point-of-care ultrasound examinations, making use of methods for: a) automating text cleaning for privacy based on an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) algorithm; b) scrolling through the video frames and annotating them using an ad hoc implemented tool; c) classifying various signs in US using a state of the art deep learning algorithm, that is an adaptive efficient method ensembling two EfficientNet-b0 weak models; d) benchmarking medical plausibility to address transparency and human in the loop setting using a post hoc explanation visual explanation method, i.e. Grad-CAM.The involved physician’s feedback remarks that this system can detect important signs in pulmonary US imaging. However, the dataset is not yet the final one since the TiAssisto project is still ongoing, with a planned conclusion in February 2024. Our ultimate goal is not merely to develop a classification system but to create an effective healthcare support system that can be used beyond primary healthcare facilities.

AB  - In this paper, the transparency of a knowledge graph (KG) generated by a governance, risk, and compliance tool is automatically evaluated for a real-world clinical use case, using a generalisable evaluation method. KGs are increasingly used in AI systems and their transparency has a prominent impact on the transparency of the systems that create and use them. There is a lack of research examining the transparency of KGs. The draft EU AI Act places transparency obligations on systems that interact with humans. In this paper, Seven transparency dimensions are calculated for a KG using a KG quality evaluation tool and three FAIR (Findable, Accessible, In-teroperable, Reusable) evaluation tools. In addition, the priorities of transparency dimensions are investigated for this use case by conducting a survey with system stakeholders. The survey results show that the understandability and inter-pretability are the most important transparency dimensions in our use case. The transparency evaluation results show that the evaluated KG has a high interpretability and is not linked to other KGs. In addition, more detailed analysis shows that some transparency-related information related to understandability, timeliness, provenance, and licensing information exists in the KG that are not detected by the evaluation tools. In this paper, for the first time, the transparency of a KG in a real-world clinical context is automatically evaluated and the importance of transparency dimensions are investigated, from the stakeholders' perspective.

AB  - The Becalm project is an open and low-cost solution for the remote monitoring of respiratory support therapies like the ones used in COVID-19 patients. Becalm combines a decision-making system based on Case-Based Reasoning with a low-cost, non-invasive mask that enables the remote monitoring, detection, and explanation of risk situations for respiratory patients. This paper first describes the mask and the sensors that allow remote monitoring. Then, it describes the intelligent decision-making system that detects anomalies and raises early warnings. This detection is based on the comparison of cases that represent patients using a set of static variables plus the dynamic vector of the patient time series from sensors. Finally, personalized visual reports are created to explain the causes of the warning, data patterns, and patient context to the healthcare professional. To evaluate the case-based early-warning system, we use a synthetic data generator that simulates patients' clinical evolution from the physiological features and factors described in healthcare literature. This generation process has been verified with a real dataset and allows the validation of the reasoning system with noisy and incomplete data, threshold values, and life/death situations. The evaluation demonstrates promising results and good accuracy (0.91) for the proposed low-cost solution to monitor respiratory patients.

AB  - eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is at the forefront of Artificial Intelligence research. Little attention, however, has been paid to the development of XAI methods for temporal data. Current state-of-the-art methods treat instances as independent and do not utilise the time dimension. Critical fields such as Healthcare and Finance often take a temporal form, leaving a prominent gap in XAI research. To this end, we propose the utilisation and optimisation of path based methods to use the temporal nature of data for explanations. In this work we (1) Extrapolate on a new technique for explainability forming a formal introduction, based on Integrated Gradients, a technique not designed for temporal data, (2) introduce new properties for time-based explainers and give an overview of the state-of-the-art methods and their adherence to these properties, (3) provide a theoretical and empirical analysis of path based methods, (4) demonstrate explanations on real world case studies. From this, we identify the proposed method best adheres to both the proposed properties and existing properties. Similarly, we demonstrate how the introduced method outperforms state-of the-art methods in the demonstrated areas

AB  - Despite the effectiveness of AI-assisted cancer detection systems, acquiring authorisation for their deployment in clinical settings has proven challenging owing to their inadequate level of explainability in their underlying mechanisms. Due to the lack of transparency in AI-driven systems’ decision-making, many medical practitioners are still reluctant to employ AI-assisted diagnoses. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is a new topic in AI that has the potential to solve the computational black boxes that AI systems posed, allowing for an explanation of a model prediction. Consequently, in this research work, we have explored the Shapley Additive explanations (SHAP), which is a model prediction explanation approach on our developed ensemble model based on the averaging techniques by concatenating the predictions of three convolutional neural network (InceptionV3, Inception-ResNetV2, and VGG16). The models were trained on the pathological findings of Kvasir-V2 datasets and have achieved an accuracy of 93.17% and F1-scores of 97%. Post-training of the ensemble model, images from the three classes were analysed using SHAP to provide an explainability on their deterministic features. The results obtained indicate a favourable and optimistic improvement in the investigation of XAI approaches in healthcare more specifically in the detection of gastrointestinal cancer.

AB  - The journey to the next decade of smart cellular connectivity, sixth-generation (6G) networks, has already begun, even though 6G is still in its nascent stages and far from its deployment. In telecommunications, 6G networks have gained the attention of the industry and academia. 6G is planned to succeed the 5G standard with almost 100 times greater speed. One of the exciting features of 6G is Edge Intelligence (EI), which is the coupling of Edge Computing with Artificial Intelligence (AI). So far, EI has yet to be a component of the existing and predecessor communication standards; thus, 6G will open up many opportunities with its deployment in the future. Nonetheless, integration of 6G with EI, in other words, Edge and AI, is also susceptible to various challenges, particularly security and privacy. Therefore, this article proposes a trusted AI-enabled intelligent architecture for the 6G-envisioned Edge Computing platform. The proposed architecture is based on the Explainable AI concept and is mainly used to ensure the security and privacy of the future 6G networks at the Edge. Following this, the work presents a detailed case study of employing the proposed framework. The preliminary discussion indicates some exciting findings and lays the foundation for future research. In a nutshell, the proposed architecture can be extended to different verticals, including, but not limited to, life-critical systems, like e-healthcare, autonomous vehicles, and traffic monitoring.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) advances are pushing the boundaries across research domains with AI-driven solutions in healthcare claiming a significant share. A key objective of these studies concerns the timely prediction of various pathological conditions. Sepsis is a life-threatening syndrome and one of the main causes of death in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. As it becomes a major health problem worldwide, sepsis early prediction could assist healthcare professionals towards making informed clinical decisions, and thereby, significantly reducing the sepsis' morbidity and mortality. A notable body of literature involving the use of AI for sepsis prediction exists. However, to the best of our knowledge, only a handful of studies focus on performing a systematic review of the AI enabled solutions for sepsis prediction in ICUs. In this context, the present paper aims to identify knowledge gaps, stimulate interest and yield motivations for future research. Moreover, to discuss ethical and explainability aspects and associated challenges. The literature search was conducted between February 2023 and April 2023 and considered eligible articles published within the last five years.

AB  - Post-surgical patient-reported outcomes (PROs) serve as a crucial subjective measure of surgical success for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients. Leveraging pre-operative patient information to predict post-operative PROs is instrumental in improving pediatric patient care and providing invaluable insights for clinical decision-making. Recently, deep learning techniques have demonstrated encouraging results in developing predictive models for clinical decision support. However, the inherent black-box nature makes them non-interactive and challenging to troubleshoot during the training phase. To mitigate this issue, our study introduces an interactive concept bottleneck model to predict subjective rehabilitation outcomes for AIS patients. We assess three learning schemas - independent, sequential, and joint - to first comprehend the concepts, which are a set of post-operative radiographic data available during the training phase. Subsequently, these acquired concepts are employed to predict post-operative patient rehabilitation outcomes across five domains: pain, function, general satisfaction, self-image, and mental health. Our results demonstrated improvement compared to the existing baseline, with the joint learning schema yielding the highest F1 score in the function and pain domains, while sequential learning recorded the highest F1 score in the mental health and self-image domains. This proposed framework harbors the immense potential to aid pre-operative surgical planning and further enhance the transparency of AI models, thereby supporting real-world clinical decision-making.

NCDs have become a significant public health burden in developed countries, with common risk factors including obesity, low physical fitness, and unhealthy lifestyle habits. Childhood and adolescence are critical periods for establishing healthy habits, and early intervention can prevent or delay the onset of NCDs later in life. However, current tools for identifying high-risk individuals mainly focus on adults, leading to missed opportunities for early detection. The SmartCHANGE project aims to address this gap by creating trustworthy AI tools that accurately assess risk factors in children and youth and promote optimised strategies for risk reduction. The paper outlines the plan for the project from the project’s proposed methodologies, including dataset utilisation, data cleaning, risk prediction models (basic and complex), and the implementation of federated learning. Additionally, it discusses user experience aspects such as participatory design, suggested applications, and the evaluation of project outcomes.

AB  - Stroke is a condition that occurs due to interruption or reduction in the blood supply to the brain. Due to this, the neurons in the brain suffer hypoxia which leads to cell injury or even death of the brain cells if not treated in time. This causes permanent or long-term injury and affects the person’s life forever. Hence, early detection and prevention of stroke are essential as it is one amongst of the top causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Decision tree methods have been developed as a useful tool for this and machine learning (ML) models have shown promise in stroke prediction. Decision trees remain suitable for use in healthcare applications because they offer interpretability and can handle both categorical and numerical data. A dataset containing demographic figures, medical record, lifestyle features, and other pertinent variables are used by this ML model. The data set is analyzed using decision tree method, which identifies risk factors for strokes and captures intricate interactions between predictors. The handling of missing values and outliers eliminates the need of intensive preparation. By using different parameters in the decision tree algorithm this model has successfully given about 93.4% accuracy on the validation dataset. This accuracy was given when the depth of the tree was set to 4. Depths of 9 and 16 were also implemented. The depth of 9 gave us 91.4% accuracy on the validation data whereas the depth of 16 gave us 91% accuracy. It is to conclude that adopting a simple model by applying the decision tree approach provides us the best results after training this model on various parameters.

AB  - The widespread proliferation of deep learning models has resulted in their extensive adoption in various domains, ranging from image recognition, Natural Language Processing (NLP), medical diagnosis, autonomous driving etc. Features such as high accuracy, quick inference, high scalability and adaptability have been instrumental in this revolution. Nonetheless, there are several elements that pose a threat to secure and reliable implementation of these models in safety-critical applications. Three primary reasons can be attributed to engender this bottleneck. First, Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are vulnerable to attacks that manipulate inputs and/or network parameters, which can compromise their performance. Additionally, faults in the DNN hardware can have adverse effects on the network accuracy. Next, error and uncertainty quantification in DNN-based inference are complex, which can undermine the dependability of their decisions. Finally, the lack of transparency and explainability in black-box models impedes their adoption in highly critical environments. This paper offers a comprehensive exploration of these issues, which must be addressed for improving the safety and reliability in adoption of machine learning models in mission-critical applications.

AB  - In the past several years, the world has witnessed an acute surge in the production and usage of smart devices which are referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT). These devices interact with each other as well as with their surrounding environments to sense, gather and process data of various kinds. Such devices are now part of our everyday’s life and are being actively used in several verticals, such as transportation, healthcare, and smart homes. IoT devices, which usually are resource-constrained, often need to communicate with other devices, such as fog nodes and/or cloud computing servers to accomplish certain tasks that demand large resource requirements. These communications entail unprecedented security vulnerabilities, where malicious parties find in this heterogeneous and multiparty architecture a compelling platform to launch their attacks. In this work, we conduct an in-depth survey on the existing intrusion detection solutions proposed for the IoT ecosystem which includes the IoT devices as well as the communications between the IoT, fog computing, and cloud computing layers. Although some survey articles already exist, the originality of this work stems from the three following points: 1) discuss the security issues of the IoT ecosystem not only from the perspective of IoT devices but also taking into account the communications between the IoT, fog, and cloud computing layers; 2) propose a novel two-level classification scheme that first categorizes the literature based on the approach used to detect attacks and then classify each approach into a set of subtechniques; and 3) propose a comprehensive cybersecurity framework that combines the concepts of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), federated learning, game theory, and social psychology to offer future IoT systems a strong protection against cyberattacks.

AB  - Ovarian cancer (OC) is a deadly disease that affects a large number of women worldwide. Machine Learning (ML) models can help in the early detection of this disease, however, the use of these models may be limited by their lack of interpretability and the difficulty to evaluate their performance. In this work, five types of datasets were used, employing clinical features, different types of coding genomic features, and combining both. The use of interpretable ML (IML) models (one linear and one nonlinear model) provided us with better interpretability of the five feature sets. Following this study, nine binary classification models were compared, and the Accuracy, Recall, and Area Under the Curve were analyzed. The results showed that ML models employed the combination of clinical features and genomes with the coding of the position of genes in patients significantly improves the prediction. We demonstrated that the inclusion of different preprocessed patient data and especially through the information provided by IML models, can help clinicians to understand the disease better and make informed treatment decisions.

AB  - Analysis of respiratory sounds is an area where deep neural networks (DNNs) may benefit clinicians and patients for diagnostic purposes due to their classification power. However, explaining the predictions made by DNNs remains a challenge. Currently, most explanation methods focus on post-hoc explanations, where a separate explanatory model is used to explain a trained DNN. Due to the complex nature of respiratory sound classification pipeline involving signal processing such as frequency analysis and wavelet analysis, post-hoc methods cannot uncover the underlying inference process of DNNs, highlighting the importance of designing DNNs with intrinsic interpretability. In this paper, we propose a self-explaining DNN for respiratory sound classification based on prototype learning. Our model explains its behavior by generating sample prototypes while attaching these prototypes to a layer inside the neural network. Furthermore, we design a scale-free interpretability mechanism, in which the model reaches its final decision by dissecting the input and looking for similarities between several parts of the input and the prototypes. The experimental findings on the largest public respiratory sound database demonstrate that our method achieves comparable, sometimes better, performance with the non-interpretable counterparts while offering state-of-the-art interpretability. The code will be released upon acceptance.

AB  - Computer-aided Diagnosis (CADx) based on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) can gain the trust of radiologists and effectively improve diagnosis accuracy and consultation efficiency. This paper proposes BI-RADS-Net-V2, a novel machine learning approach for fully automatic breast cancer diagnosis in ultrasound images. The BI-RADS-Net-V2 can accurately distinguish malignant tumors from benign ones and provides both semantic and quantitative explanations. The explanations are provided in terms of clinically proven morphological features used by clinicians for diagnosis and reporting mass findings, i.e., Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS). The experiments on 1,192 Breast Ultrasound (BUS) images indicate that the proposed method improves the diagnosis accuracy by taking full advantage of the medical knowledge in BI-RADS while providing both semantic and quantitative explanations for the decision.

AB  - Accurate and interpretable differential diagnostic technologies are crucial for supporting clinicians in decision-making and treatment-planning for patients with fever of unknown origin (FUO). Existing solutions commonly address the diagnosis of FUO by transforming it into a multi-classification task. However, after the emergence of COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians have recognized the heightened significance of early diagnosis in patients with FUO, particularly for practical needs such as early triage. This has resulted in increased demands for identifying a wider range of etiologies, shorter observation windows, and better model interpretability. In this article, we propose an interpretable hierarchical multimodal neural network framework (iHMNNF) to facilitate early diagnosis of FUO by incorporating medical domain knowledge and leveraging multimodal clinical data. The iHMNNF comprises a top-down hierarchical reasoning framework (Td-HRF) built on the class hierarchy of FUO etiologies, five local attention-based multimodal neural networks (La-MNNs) trained for each parent node of the class hierarchy, and an interpretable module based on layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) and attention mechanism. Experimental datasets were collected from electronic health records (EHRs) at a large-scale tertiary grade-A hospital in China, comprising 34,051 hospital admissions of 30,794 FUO patients from January 2011 to October 2020. Our proposed La-MNNs achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) values ranging from 0.7809 to 0.9035 across all five decomposed tasks, surpassing competing machine learning (ML) and single-modality deep learning (DL) methods while also providing enhanced interpretability. Furthermore, we explored the feasibility of identifying FUO etiologies using only the first N-hour time series data obtained after admission.

AB  - So far, initial treatment recommendations for internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) decision support were mostly high-level or static. Personalized treatment recommendations could pave the way toward better treatment outcomes and adaptive treatments by leveraging information from past patients. We explore the disadvantages of multi-class recommendation and propose a modular approach using multilabel classification for treatment recommendations. Our machine learning-based treatment recommender composes treatment programs from a set of modules. It achieves a 79.02% F1-score on historically successful treatments, significantly outperforming the existing system by around 4% while offering other advantages such as interpretability and robustness. Using our recommendation as an initial starting point, clinicians can adjust the modular treatments to provide a more personalized treatment.

AB  - Deep Learning for Time-series plays a key role in AI for healthcare. To predict the progress of infectious disease outbreaks and demonstrate clear population-level impact, more granular analyses are urgently needed that control for important and potentially confounding county-level socioeconomic and health factors. We forecast US county-level COVID-19 infections using the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT). We focus on heterogeneous time-series deep learning model prediction while interpreting the complex spatiotemporal features learned from the data. The significance of the work is grounded in a real-world COVID-19 infection prediction with highly non-stationary, finely granular, and heterogeneous data. 1) Our model can capture the detailed daily changes of temporal and spatial model behaviors and achieves better prediction performance compared to other time-series models. 2) We analyzed the attention patterns from TFT to interpret the temporal and spatial patterns learned by the model. 3) We collected around 2.5 years of socioeconomic and health features for 3142 US counties, such as observed cases, and a number of static (age distribution and health disparity) and dynamic features (vaccination, disease spread, transmissible cases, and social distancing). Using the proposed framework, we have shown that our model can learn complex interactions. Interpreting different impacts at the county level would be crucial for understanding the infection process that can help effective public health decision-making.

AB  - The biggest obstacle that prohibits relatively wealthy individuals and organizations from donating to charities is a lack of trust, transparency, and security. It is not inconceivable to think the donated funds might not achieve the intended purpose or reach the expected audience–whether it is for cancer patients, environmental conservatism, social services, nationalized healthcare, or so on. This belief is amplified by the stories of fraudulent charities and middlemen defrauding generous donors under the pretext of social causes. Our research paper aims at designing a charity system that uses blockchain to store transaction records for charities. This solves the issues of trust, transparency, and security that plague current charity platforms. Further, we have leveraged machine learning to develop an enhanced recommendation system of charities to donors, on the basis of a calculated accountability score (which is a signature of the transparency for that charity) and donor interests.

Technological advancements have improved maternal healthcare extensively yet some of the issues that exists in providing healthcare services are data security, informed decisions, reliability and transparency. Use of modern medical technology can help to overcome these issues and lower the number of maternal deaths. In this paper, we have tried to merge blockchain technology with ML enabled predictive analytics algorithm for collecting, analyzing and storing maternal healthcare information protected and predicting the complications degree of risk during pregnancy. As the patient data stored in blockchain cannot be modified, it helps in providing security and reliability. A blockchain based system to predict pregnancy complications has been proposed. To assess this system a dataset has been used that can be accessed publicly.

Researchers explored using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to forecast whether heart failure patients must be readmitted to the hospital. This study examines ML algorithms that use data from electronic health records to forecast hospital readmissions for patients with heart failure. We will assess the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and artificial neural networks. The study's results will show how well ML algorithms predict heart failure patients' hospital readmission risk, which could lead to personalized therapies that improve patient outcomes and save healthcare costs. Comparing studies in this field shows gaps in model interpretability, generalizability, and socioeconomic determinants of health in prediction models.

AB  - The rapid development of computational pathology has brought new opportunities for prognosis prediction using histopathological images. However, the existing deep learning frameworks lack exploration of the relationship between images and other prognostic information, resulting in poor interpretability. Tumor mutation burden (TMB) is a promising biomarker for predicting the survival outcomes of cancer patients, but its measurement is costly. Its heterogeneity may be reflected in histopathological images. Here, we report a two-step framework for prognostic prediction using whole-slide images (WSIs). First, the framework adopts a deep residual network to encode the phenotype of WSIs and classifies patient-level TMB by the deep features after aggregation and dimensionality reduction. Then, the patients' prognosis is stratified by the TMB-related information obtained during the classification model development. Deep learning feature extraction and TMB classification model construction are performed on an in-house dataset of 295 Haematoxylin & Eosin stained WSIs of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). The development and evaluation of prognostic biomarkers are performed on The Cancer Genome Atlas-Kidney ccRCC (TCGA-KIRC) project with 304 WSIs. Our framework achieves good performance for TMB classification with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.813 on the validation set. Through survival analysis, our proposed prognostic biomarkers can achieve significant stratification of patients' overall survival (P $< $ 0.05) and outperform the original TMB signature in risk stratification of patients with advanced disease. The results indicate the feasibility of mining TMB-related information from WSI to achieve stepwise prognosis prediction.

AB  - Acute psychological stress (APS) is a complex multifactorial event caused by drivers such as anxiety, mental and competition stress. It can occur concurrently with physical activity (PA), making its detection and classification challenging. This study investigates the detection and classification of APS (alone or concurrent with PA) by using physiological signals collected using Empatica E4 wristband. Multi-task Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) achieved F1 scores of 99.89% and 98.31% for the classification of various PA (treadmill run, stationary bike) and APS (competitive mental, anxiety stress, non-stress) and sedentary state. Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) is used to interpret the global importance of the physiological signals, determining the order of importance physiological signals for APS detection and classification. The results indicate (in decreasing order of importance): galvanic skin response (GSR), heart rate (HR), skin temperature (ST), accelerometer (ACC) X-axis, ACC Y-axis, ACC Z-axis. The increase in GSR and HR are positively correlated with the occurrence of APS as indicated by high positive SHAP values.

AB  - In healthcare, accurate illness prediction is essential for early discovery, prompt treatment, and better patient outcomes. The quantity of data from medical claims offers a chance to use machine learning methods to anticipate diseases. The complicated and unstructured nature of medical claims data makes it difficult to create precise prediction models. The emergence of AutoML frameworks as potent tools for tackling the difficulties of illness prediction using medical claims is presented in this research. We examine and evaluate several cuttingedge AutoML frameworks and their use in illness prediction tasks with data from medical claims. These frameworks use cutting-edge algorithms and approaches, including feature engineering, ensemble learning, and model stacking, to improve illness prediction models' predictive accuracy and interpretability. A broader spectrum of medical professionals and researchers may use AutoML because of its automated nature, which facilitates the effective use of computing resources and lessens the load of domain expertise. This study uses data from medical claims to demonstrate the potential of AutoML frameworks for precise illness prediction. In order to fully realise the promise of medical claims data for better patient care and health outcomes, it emphasises the significance of automated techniques in healthcare analytics and the necessity of more research and development in this field.

AB  - The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) technology’s fast advancements aided smart healthcare systems to a larger extent. IoMT devices, on the other hand, rely on centralized processing and storage systems because of their limited computational and storage capacity. The reliance is susceptible to a single point of failure (SPoF) and erodes the user control over their medical data. In addition, Cloud models result in communication delays, which slow down the system’s overall reaction time. To overcome these issues a decentralized distributed smart healthcare system is proposed that eliminates the SPoF and third-party control over healthcare data. Additionally, the proposed Fortified-Chain 2.0 uses a blockchain-based selective sharing mechanism with a mutual authentication technique to solve the issues, such as data privacy, security, and trust management in decentralized peer-to-peer healthcare systems. Also, we suggested a hybrid computing paradigm to deal with latency, computational, and storage constraints. A novel distributed machine learning (ML) module named random forest support vector machine (RFSVM) also embedded into the Fortified-Chain 2.0 system to automate patient health monitoring. In the RFSVM module, a random forest (RF) is used to select an optimal set of features from patients data in real-time environment and also support vector machine (SVM) is used to perform the decision making tasks. The proposed Fortified-Chain 2.0 works on a private blockchain-based distributed decentralised storage system (DDSS) that improves the system-level transparency, integrity, and traceability. Fortified-Chain 2.0 outperformed the existing Fortified-Chain in terms of low latency, high throughput, and availability with the help of a mutual authentication method.

AB  - Electronic health records (EHRs), serving as patient-centered repositories for medical data, offer the opportunity for researchers to uncover concealed patterns using machine learning (ML). However, in real-world medical settings, clinicians often face the task of selecting pertinent feature dimensions from a range of potential medical metrics and then deducing potential labels from vague diagnostic descriptions, prior to the modeling phase. This complexity presents challenges in obtaining reliable training/testing data and conducting thorough analysis. Consequently, these hurdles hinder the practical application of ML for automated modeling and comprehensible interpretation of inﬂuencing factors. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a visual analytics approach designed to navigate the feature and label space within EHRs, while also streamlining the modeling process through automated ML algorithms and techniques for improved interpretability.

AB  - A cataract is a common eye condition that predominantly affects the eye's crystalline lens, resulting in a diminishing of its natural transparency and a gradual decline in visual sharpness. This clouding of the lens can hinder the capacity to perceive objects clearly and difficulty in carry out everyday tasks effortlessly. Early and precise diagnosis of this disease plays a crucial role for securing vision quality and avoiding life-threatening issues. This paper proposes a novel method for detecting cataract disease at early stages using a convolutional neural network-based VGG16 model. This technique has achieved a remarkable accuracy of 96.10% on the cataract and normal eye disease dataset collected from Kaggle. This model has been fine-tuned by keeping the value of the learning rate at 0.01 and the accuracy has been measured at epochs 5, 10, 15, and 20. The loss value of the proposed odel has been also measured which identified that the model shows the least loss of 0.1651 at epoch 20. This study also highlights the potential of deep learning to revolutionize the detection of eye diseases while simultaneously highlighting the significance of moral and cooperative approaches to the quest for better healthcare solutions.

AB  - Thanks to the huge accumulation of Electronic Health Records (EHRs), numerous deep learning based predictive models were proposed for this task. Among them, most of the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models were built with recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Regardless of their success, RNN-based models mainly suffer from three limitations. (i) Accuracy: the prediction accuracy of RNN-based models drops quickly as the length of EHR sequences increases. (ii) Efficiency: the recurrence property of RNN-based models makes the computation parallelization impossible, and accordingly hurts the efficiency of such models in practice. (iii) Interpretability: the outputs of RNN-based models are difficult to explain due to the unexplainable nature of deep models. In this paper, we resort to the recently advanced attention mechanism to model the dependencies between inputs and outputs, which overcomes shortages of RNN-based models in accuracy and efficiency. As for interpretability, we model the relationships with two linear mappings from the input to the output, which account for two important factors—one is for context-aware information and the other is for time-aware representation—of capturing discriminative features in learning patient’s representations. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in both accuracy and computational efficiency, meanwhile, analyze and discuss the reasonability of each explanation approach.

We use a deductive approach employing a descriptive study format while adopting an interpretivist attitude, utilizing secondary data sets for the training of models. Illustration resampling, region of interest (ROI) recognition, and radiomic extracted features are all methods used for preprocessing. The reduction of dimension as well as feature selection are aided by the principle component analysis (PCA). The model, which uses support vector machines (SVMs) as well as convolutional deep neural networks (CNNs), performs better than others in classifying different lung cancer subtypes. The stability and universality of the model are confirmed by cross-validation findings. High levels of agreement when compared to leading radiologists show the model's clinical promise. Model generalizations, interpretability, and computing efficiency are all significantly improved by feature selection including dimensionality reduction. The report advises more research into longitudinal evaluations clinical execution trials, and multiple communication data integration. The importance of addressing ethical issues and guaranteeing adaptation to changing diagnostic criteria cannot be overstated. This study provides the groundwork for revolutionary improvements in lung cancer being diagnosed, with broad repercussions for more individualized treatment plans and better patient outcomes.

AB  - In order to analyze Electrocardiograms (ECGs) in real time, this research is the first to integrate Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) into a cloud-based healthcare system. By utilizing sophisticated computational algorithms and an interpretivist perspective, the research seeks to transform cardiac diagnosis. Though extremely useful, traditional ECG analysis techniques have processing speed as well as scalability issues. The suggested method instantaneously interprets ECG waveforms by utilizing RNNs' temporal modeling capabilities. This paradigm change makes it possible to identify cardiac problems in a timely manner, potentially improving patient outcomes. Setting up a scalable cloud system for effective data processing is part of the study methodology. The RNN model is trained, verified, and then incorporated into the cloud system using secondary ECG data. The system's efficacy is confirmed by performance evaluation criteria like processing speed, sensitivity, and accuracy. Scalability, safety of data, and interpretability issues in models are highlighted via critical analysis. Techniques for improved model openness, strict data protection policies, and thorough scalability testing are all included in the recommendations.

AB  - In recent years, the advancements in the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) or smart devices have enabled the automatic monitoring of human health. Using smart healthcare devices can not only reduce the burden on hospitals but also save costs, travel time, and provide a way to diagnose diseases at home, such as stroke rates. The IoMT generates a large amount of data, which can be used to train machine learning (ML) models for accurate disease diagnosis. However, the data used to train ML models is usually private, making it challenging to share and requiring high security. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes a collaborative framework called TrustFedHealth for training ML-based heart disease prediction models. TrustFedHealth uses Federated Learning (FL) to allow training with decentralized data stored separately on multiple machines. Moreover, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is incorporated into the model as a solution to optimize communication time between the different elements of the system and reduce congestion. Homomorphic Encryption (HE) is also combined with FL to protect the confidentiality of model updates between clients and aggregation servers. Additionally, Blockchain (BC) is leveraged to tackle the traceability of contributions and guarantee transparency of model updates. Through evaluation results on the Physionet’s MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset, TrustFedHealth provides a promising approach for training ML-based heart disease prediction models while maintaining privacy and security.

AB  - In recent years, explainable AI (XAI) has been emphasized in various fields such as healthcare, finance, etc. Since the fuzzy rules in fuzzy inference models are structured as If-Then rules, the inference process of fuzzy inference models can be easily understood by humans. Among them, a deep TSK fuzzy inference model has fuzzy rules with low complexities due to select randomly features and map randomly them to fuzzy partitions. However, this randomness may lead to situations where important features or fuzzy partitions of them that have a significant impact on the results are not used in the inference. Therefore, this paper propose a deep modular fuzzy inference model with high accuracy and stability using small number of fuzzy rules with high interpretability.

AB  - Decision support systems (DSS) are increasingly applied in critical domains like healthcare and criminal justice, where trust is of paramount importance. Trust relies on system transparency and explainability. A notable approach is the globally-consistent summary-explanation (SE) method, providing rule-based local explanations with valuable global insights while ensuring 100% dataset consistency. However, simpler globally-consistent SEs suffer from reduced support, undermining their persuasiveness. To address this, we apply q-consistent SEs, striking a subtle balance between consistency and support. Resolving the maximizing support with q-consistency (MSqC) problem poses a challenge more intricate than global-consistency. To enhance solution efficiency, our paper introduces an improved graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) model with a Sample graph attention network (GAT) layer for learning branch and bound (B&B) variable selection strategies. Experimental results on credit evaluation scenarios confirm the effectiveness of the GAT-GCNN model in improving accuracy and efficiency in solving MSqC problems.

AB  - Significant advancements have been achieved recently in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to solve healthcare-related problems. A potential method for identifying and treating many illnesses is machine learning (ML). The “Breast Cancer Dataset” was used in this work to perform classification tasks using ML techniques including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF) and MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) for identifying the forms of breast cancer, either Benign or Malignant. The SVM, RF, and MLP achieved impressive PR scores exceeding 0.98. However, MLP exhibited superior performance among these algorithms, achieving an exceptional AUC value of 99.71. Conversely, SVM slightly outperformed the other algorithms in terms of training accuracy, with a value of 97.90%. This work used shapley additive explanations (SHAP) and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) to shed light on how these categorization algorithms made judgments. These interpretability methodologies showed that the majority of characteristics consistently predicted the presence of malignant or benign cancer types. This study demonstrates how ML algorithms' decision-making procedures may be understood, possibly promoting the use of ML in clinical settings for medical diagnosis.

AB  - With the significant advancement and evolution of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), the healthcare industry has witnessed a rapid transformation from traditional hospitals to patient-centric hospitals in which the telemedicine paradigm is adopted to facilitate remote monitoring of patients efficiently without any delay. However, telemedicine data acquired through modernized healthcare can be exploited to the various data leakage, privacy, and security challenges. For that, some of the researchers adopted the public blockchain network in telemedicine, but it does not guarantee security and privacy to that extent due to its high immutability and transparency. Therefore, we develop a proposed system using a Hyperledger Fabric-based blockchain network. We also proposed an access control mechanism to restrict patient's EHR data and improve the data privacy of the proposed system. We have designed a chaincode to interact with the permissioned blockchain network. It helps to save and access EHR data from the blockchain network. The Proposed system also designs rules for every participant of the blockchain network using Permission.acl file that considers different rules for different participants with the specification of operation, resource, and actions. Finally, the performance of the proposed system by integrating Hyperledger Caliper is evaluated in terms of transactions per second for doctor and patient access control policies.

AB  - The area of medical imaging has experienced a remarkable expansion in recent times, with radiologists heavily depending on medical images for precise diagnoses. However, radiologists often encounter difficulties when presented with cases of uncertain diagnoses as they struggle to find comparable cases in both public and internal databases to assist them in their decision-making. This manual search process not only detracts from the ability to diagnose new cases but also places a considerable burden on radiologists’ workflow. To tackle these challenges, this study suggests a computer-aided system that can automatically retrieve annotated medical images with similar content. This system incorporates a feature extractor based on deep learning, designed to simplify the process of identifying comparable images from an extensive chest radiograph database. The main focus of this study is on the feature extractor, which utilizes YOLOv5 and EfficientNet. YOLOv5 is known for its fast and efficient object detection framework, while the EfficientNet-B0 encoder block serves as an image retrieval and EfficientNet-B3 helps prevent noisy predictions. The study conducted experiments on a large dataset to evaluate the performance of the proposed solution. The results demonstrate that the model outperforms other classical approaches, with a mean average precision of 0.488 at a threshold of 0.9, which is higher than the performance of YOLOv5+ResNet, and EfficientDet of 0.234 and 0.257 respectively. Moreover, the model precision was significantly higher, with a precision of 0.864 for all pathologies, which was 0.352 higher than YOLOv5+ResNet and EfficientDet. Overall, the proposed computer-assisted system has the potential to enhance the efficiency of radiologists’ workflow by offering a more effective and efficient tool for retrieving similar annotated medical images. This study is a significant advancement in the development of intelligent and efficient image retrieval systems in the medical imaging field. The proposed solution has the potential to significantly impact the diagnosis of complex medical cases, particularly in emergency departments.

AB  - Although the field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) in Human-Robot Interaction is gathering increasing attention, how well different explanations compare across HRI scenarios is still not well understood. We conducted an exploratory online study with 335 participants analysing the interaction between type of explanation (counterfactual, feature-based, and no explanation), the stake of the scenario (high, low) and the application scenario (healthcare, industry). Participants viewed one of 12 different vignettes depicting a combination of these three factors and rated their system understanding and trust in the robot. Compared to no explanation, both counterfactual and feature-based explanations improved system understanding and performance trust (but not moral trust). Additionally, when no explanation was present, high-stake scenarios led to significantly worse performance trust and system understanding. These findings suggest that explanations can be used to calibrate users’ perceptions of the robot in high-stake scenarios.

AB  - Securing Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) is one of the most critical applications of cryptography over the Internet due to the value and importance of data contained in such EMRs. Although blockchain-based healthcare systems can provide security, privacy, and immutability to EMRs, several outstanding security and latency issues are associated with existing schemes. For example, some researchers have used the blockchain as a storage tool which increases delay and adversely affects the blockchain performance since it stores a copy of each transaction. A distributed ledger also requires appropriate space and computational power with increased data size. In addition, existing healthcare-based approaches usually rely on centralized servers connected to clouds, which are vulnerable to denial of service (DoS), distributed DoS (DDoS), and collusion attacks. This paper proposes a novel hybrid-deep learning-based homomorphic encryption (HE) model for the Industrial Internet of Medical Things (IIoMT) to cope with such challenges using a consortium blockchain. Integrating HE with the proposed IIoMT system is a vital contribution of this work. The use of HE while outsourcing to the cloud the storage provides a unique facility to perform any statistical and machine learning operation on the encrypted EMR data, hence providing resistance to collusion and phishing attacks. Our proposed model uses a pre-trained hybrid deep learning model in the cloud and deploys the trained model into blockchain-based edge devices in order to classify and train local models using EMRs. This is further conditioned on the private data of each edge and IoT device connected with the consortium blockchain. All local models obtained are aggregated to the cloud to update a global model, which is finally disseminated to the edge nodes. Our proposed approach provides more privacy and security than conventional models and can deliver high efficiency and low end-to-end latency for users. Comparative simulation analysis with state-of-the-art approaches is carried out using benchmark performance metrics, which show that our proposed model provides enhanced security, efficiency, and transparency.

AB  - Breast cancer remains a significant public health concern and a leading cause of female mortality despite recent advances in healthcare. Experts agree that its early prognosis is a key to survivability. In this research, we proposed a deep learning architecture code-named AWFCNET. It comprised multiple segments of preprocessing techniques (color shifting & image enhancement), feature learning based on ResNeXt-101 convolutional network as a backbone with transfer and attention-aware mechanisms, and fusion classifier composed of three recurrent neural networks. The generalization capability of the pipeline produced 98.10% accuracy on a mammogram dataset using 10-fold cross-validation. Computational benchmarks revealed that it surpassed existing state-of-the-art approaches with provisions of visual interpretability via gradient maps. Thus, our framework could complement physicians’ expertise in rapid and dependable breast cancer diagnoses.

AB  - Convolutional neural networks have achieved great success in the field of image recognition, however, their inherent black-box properties hinder their application in highly sensitive fields such as healthcare and autonomous driving. Therefore, interpretable artificial intelligence (XAI) has become a hot topic of academic research, which aims at exploring the working mechanism inside deep convolutional neural networks. Causality is an important means to explore the working mechanism of neural networks. For image classification, the image classification results depend on the causal features or background features of the input image. Grad-CAM is a popular interpretation method to visualize these features, and its visualization results in a deep integration of causal and context features. In this paper, we propose a background category-based feature integration method to estimate the context features, and then apply an ensemble theory approach to extract causal features from Grad-CAM. The experimental results show that our Grad-CAM-based extracted causal features not only have better causality in ResNet50, VGG16, and GoogleNet compared with Grad-CAM and Grad-CAM++, but also are similar to the visualization results of Grad-CAM ++ in terms of target object localization of visualization results. In addition, we verify that our method is applicable not only to high category fine-grained datasets but also to low fine-grained datasets through category fine-grained experiments.

AB  - The interest in metaverse applications by existing industries has seen massive growth thanks to the accelerated pace of research in key technological fields and the shift towards virtual interactions fueled by the Covid-19 pandemic. One key industry that can benefit from the integration into the metaverse is healthcare. The potential to provide enhanced care for patients affected by multiple health issues, from standard afflictions to more specialized pathologies, is being explored through the fabrication of architectures that can support metaverse applications. In this paper, we focus on the persistent issues of lung cancer detection, monitoring, and treatment, to propose MetaLung, a privacy and integrity-preserving architecture on the metaverse. We discuss the use cases to enable remote patient-doctor interactions, patient constant monitoring, and remote care. By leveraging technologies such as digital twins, edge computing, explainable AI, IoT, and virtual/augmented reality, we propose how the system could provide better assistance to lung cancer patients and suggest individualized treatment plans to the doctors based on their information. In addition, we describe the current implementation state of the AI-based Decision Support System for treatment selection, I3LUNG, and the current state of patient data collection.

AB  - Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the go-to method for medical imaging classification on various imaging modalities for binary and multiclass problems. Deep CNNs extract spatial features from image data hierarchically, with deeper layers learning more relevant features for the classification application. Despite the high predictive accuracy, usability lags in practical applications due to the black-box model perception. Model explainability and interpretability are essential for successfully integrating artificial intelligence into healthcare practice. This work addresses the challenge of an explainable deep learning model for the prediction of the severity of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). AD diagnosis and prognosis heavily rely on neuroimaging information, particularly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We present a deep learning model framework that integrates a local data-driven interpretation method that explains the relationship between the predicted AD severity from the CNN and the input MR brain image. The deep explainer uses SHapley Additive exPlanation values to quantity the contribution of different brain regions utilized by the CNN to predict outcomes. We conduct a comparative analysis of three high-performing CNN models: DenseNet121, DenseNet169, and Inception-ResNet-v2. The framework shows high sensitivity and specificity in the test sample of subjects with varying levels of AD severity. We also correlated five key AD neurocognitive assessment outcome measures and the APOE genotype biomarker with model misclassifications to facilitate a better understanding of model performance.

AB  - The organ supply chain plays a crucial role in order to give new life to patients who need organs and improving their quality of life. In a traditional Organ supply chain, there are privacy and transparency issues due to the centralized system. To address those issues, we have proposed a blockchain-based framework. In that, we have made two smart contracts, one for the Donor side and Another for the Recipient. Data of the Donor and Recipient are stored in the Decentralized Database IPFS. We have presented a mathematical model for our framework and presented a graphical comparison of all the functions that are used in smart contracts based on Transaction cost and Execution cost.

AB  - IoT-based smart healthcare system (SHS) allows doctors to monitor and diagnose patients remotely, which can greatly ease overcrowding in the hospitals and disequilibrium of medical resources, especially during the rage of COVID-19. However, the SHS generates enormous data which contains sensitive personal information. To protect patients’ privacy, we propose a secure blockchain (BC)-assisted access control scheme for SHS in fog computing. All the operations of users are recorded on the BC by smart contract in order to ensure transparency and reliability of the system. We present a BC-assisted multiauthority attribute-based encryption (MA-ABE) scheme with keyword search to ensure the confidentiality of the data, avoid single point of failure and implement fine-grained access control of the system. IoT devices are limited in resources, therefore it is not practical to apply the BC-assisted MA-ABE scheme directly. To reduce the burdens of IoT devices, We outsource most of the computational tasks to fog nodes. Finally, the security and performance analysis demonstrate that the proposed system is reliable, practical, and efficient.

AB  - Medical image Processing is an emerging field based upon Modern 3D imaging with substantial scientific and medical improvement. Significantly it results in production of images with improved resolution. As the field of computerised medical image visualisation continues to expand and developments in computer-aided diagnosis, it is necessary to build in the field of science, imaging is one of the most crucial fields. Lung cancer is one of the most prevalent types of cancer as it forms major part of mortality due to cancer. For diagnosis of Lung cancer, Image processing techniques are used. The system thus designed act as support for Health workers in diagnosing the disease thereby increasing life expectancy. CT scanning images are used to detect the presence of the cancer nodule. The images captured through tools is subjected to pre-processing stage comprising of Image enhancement and image segmentation. To improvise image interpretability for extraction of information enhancement plays an important role. The segmentation process is applied which can segment the data into certain parts. The segmented data can be given as input for the feature extraction. The cancer can be detected based on the features which are extracted in this phase. The methodology of GLCM and hybrid classification is proposed in this research work for identifying and locating the cancerous area in the CT scan image

AB  - Predicted inpatient length of stay (LOS) after total joint arthroplasty (TJA) is important information that sets the expectation for the post-surgical recovery period, which helps hospital management plan, and manage surgical resources as efficiently as possible. In this study, the accuracy of prediction models for predicting patients' LOS in a rural community hospital was conducted in the Northwest United States of America. Data were collected from 181 patients for hip, knee, and shoulder surgeries. A decision tree (DT) prediction model was compared with the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) calculator for predicting LOS of TJA. The DT model (RMSE = 0.67) provided a more accurate LOS prediction than the NSQIP calculator (RMSE = 1.18). Furthermore, a greater level of interpretability of the decision-making process makes the DT model very applicable in “high stakes” environments like healthcare.

AB  - CNNs and Edge computing have proliferated in the last decade. While these technologies are stupendous in their own right, new horizons can be opened up if they were to be combined. Deep and complex CNNs, which are ones that produce groundbreaking accuracies, are not feasible for deployment in a resource constraint environment. The vanguard in model compression is an innovative technique known as Knowledge Distillation. This paper proposes a way to perform knowledge distillation by means of Attention Maps. The generation of attention maps from features is achieved through the use of ATCam. Not only does this method effectively distills knowledge it also nullifies another flaw of CNNs-black-boxiness. This may lead to leapfrogs in Mobile Machine Aided Medical Diagnosis by deploying interpretable complex CNN in small devices. Three ways to combine the feature maps were experimented with in this research work, which are Feature Map Accumulation(FMA), Maximum Intensity Projection(MIPs) and Saliency Maps. The performance of the proposed approaches are tested on PADUFES-20 dataset and all the three approaches provided significant boost in the performance over the traditional transfer learning methods. The best of these methods - saliency maps - gains a accuracy boost of 9.56% over the generic methods of knowledge transfer. Moreover, to one’s surprise, the resultant model not only matches the teacher model in accuracy, it exceeds it by 1.52% while being only 43.2% of original teacher model’s size.

AB  - Guava is an essential fruit in many areas, but production is hampered by common diseases. In order to accurately identify diseases in guava leaves, this research pioneers a novel approach combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Random Forest. For training and validation, a dataset encompassing five main guava diseases is used. Three convolutional layers and max pooling are part of the model architecture, which is repeated for reliable feature extraction. A flattening layer follows this, and then the Random Forest classifier—which is set up with 12 decision trees—enters. With 98.9% in 5-fold cross validation and 99.2% in 10-fold cross validation, experimental results demonstrate exceptional accuracy. The model outperforms current methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in diagnosing diseases. Additional performance indicators include precision, recall, and F1-scores. The suggested methodology not only aids in early disease diagnosis but also assures guava farmers of significant financial gains by reducing yield losses. The GradCAM method also offers transparency, providing insightful information into the model's decision-making process. The dataset needs to be expanded, and real-time deployment options need to be investigated. This study represents an important advance in precision agriculture and may completely alter how guava disease is managed.

AB  - Diabetes is a major global health issue that affects multiple bodily components and contributes to millions of deaths each year. Traditional approaches to diabetes diagnosis and treatment are often limited by their lack of accuracy, transparency, and efficiency. This study aims to develop and evaluate a novel machine learning-based diagnosis system for diabetes mellitus using interpretable supervised and neural network techniques. The study used a dataset of 9 features listed in 2000 patient information from The Frankfurt Hospital, Germany, and trained and tested several ML algorithms including logistic regression, gradient boosting, naive Bayes classifier, random forest classifier, and artificial neural network (ANN). The performance of each algorithm was evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score, and the findings indicate that the ANN model performs best with a larger number of features, achieving 100% accuracy. Interpretable techniques were used to facilitate understanding of the ML model decision-making process. The suggested system offers several implications and potential impacts on healthcare practice, including improved diagnosis accuracy, automation of diabetes testing and referral algorithms, and reduced time, work, and labor in medical services. These findings highlight the potential of machine learning to address the limitations of traditional diabetes diagnosis and treatment, and contribute to better patient outcomes.

AB  - Acute radiation dermatitis (AD) is a prevalent side effect during radiotherapy that, if not intervened in a timely manner, can reduce patients' quality of life, impact their health, and even result in mortality. Therefore, a highly precise hierarchical TSK fuzzy classifier is devised to cater to the necessity for early intervention in AD. However, the existing hierarchical TSK fuzzy classifiers grapple with the issue of arbitrary input-output projection between adjacent layers and lacks actively guided learning methods. This discrepancy results in relatively substantial errors in the hierarchical learning process, hindering the implementation of targeted active learning. Consequently, this study introduces an innovative labeled actively guided hierarchical Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy classifier (LAG-TSK-FC). The classifier leverages optimized zero-order TSK fuzzy classifiers and is constructed upon an enhanced cascaded structure. Additionally, this study proposes a technique involving label intervention for error amplification to enhance the accuracy of each layer, thereby ensuring classification accuracy and generalization performance. Furthermore, an optimized approach for minimizing training error to compute the consequent parameters is presented. Through label guidance, intentional consistency is achieved between the preceding and succeeding layers, ensuring the transmission of the same physical interpretation to maintain high accuracy and interpretability of the classifier. Finally, experimental validation on four AD datasets demonstrates that LAG-TSK-FC exhibits commendable classification and generalization performance, maintaining high accuracy.

AB  - The use of fast, accurate, and automatic knee radiography analysis is becoming increasingly important in orthopedics, and it is becoming more important in improving patient-specific diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Precise characterization of plain knee radiographs can greatly impact patient care, as they are usually used in preoperative and intraoperative planning. Rapid yet, deep learning medical image analysis has already shown success in a variety of knee image analysis tasks, ranging from knee joint area localization to joint space segmentation and measurement, with almost a human-like performance. However, there are several fundamental challenges that stop deep learning methods to obtain their full potential in a clinical setting such as orthopedics. These include the need for a large number of gold-standard, manually annotated training images and a lack of explainability and interpretability. To address these challenges, this study is the first to present an explainable deep few-shot learning model that can localize the knee joint area and segment the joint space in plain knee radiographs, using only a small number of manually annotated radiographs. The accuracy performance of the proposed method was thoroughly and experimentally evaluated using various image localization and segmentation measures, and it was compared to baseline models that utilized large-scale fully-annotated training datasets. The current deep few-shot learning methods achieved an average Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.94 and a mean Average Precision @0.5 of 0.98, using 10-shot learning in the localization of the knee joint area, and an average IoU of 0.91 in the knee joint space segmentation using only 10 manually annotated radiographs.

AB  - This study is the first to use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict the probability of stroke from patient medical records. Researchers create a complete model that is capable of capturing complex temporal patterns by adopting an interpretivist mindset and a deductive methodology. Analysis in comparison to traditional models demonstrates the LSTM's greater prediction skills. The model's dependability is confirmed by robustness tests along with sensitivity studies. Enhancing interpretability as well as prospective clinical confirmation should be the main goals of future effort. There is room for improvement in the integration of immediate monitoring using multimodal data. This groundbreaking method represents a considerable advance in the timely and individualized prevention of stroke

AB  - To evaluate the health and well-being of an unborn child throughout pregnancy, fetal risk prediction is a crucial component of prenatal care. The evaluation of potential risks and issues related to fetal development may now be done by healthcare professionals using a variety of instruments and methodologies due to developments in medical technology and research. One way to predict fetal risk is with a machine learning algorithm using Cardiotocographic (CTG) data. Massive amounts of medical data can be analyzed using machine learning algorithms to aid clinicians in making more precise diagnoses. The objective of this study was to provide the current state and future research in the field of ML-based interpretation of CTG data by mapping current knowledge in the field. The search was performed on Science Direct, SCOPUS, IEEE, and ProQuest databases. RepOrting standards for Systematic Evidence Syntheses (ROSES) in environmental research guidelines were followed. After screening process, we obtained 42 recent studies that examined the application of machine learning algorithms for interpreting CTG tracings. Future research should focus on a larger and more diverse dataset, comparative evaluations, real-world clinical testing, and developing models that combine accuracy with interpretability.

AB  - This study uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to construct an automated parasite identification method in blood smear pictures, addressing the urgent need for accurate and easy malaria diagnosis. We use secondary data collected from several datasets, utilizing an interpretive mindset, a deductive technique, as well as a descriptive research strategy. Technical considerations such as architecture selection, data preparation, and interpretability approaches are carefully taken into account when perfecting the CNN model. The model's effectiveness has been demonstrated by results showing excellent sensitivity (95%) and specificity (92%) in parasite identification. Techniques for visualization make regions of interest clearer, increasing confidence and transparency.

This study introduces an innovative methodology for the categorization of kidney diseases by using advanced deep learning algorithms. In this study, we conducted fine-tuning of the EfficientNet-B3 architecture using a large dataset of CT kidney images. The dataset consisted of four unique classes, namely Normal, Cyst, Tumour, and Stone. The dataset exhibits a wide range of variations, enabling a thorough evaluation of kidney disorders often seen in the context of clinical practice. Through the use of this dataset for model training, a notable classification accuracy of 95.77% was attained, hence showcasing the efficacy of our methodology in discerning between distinct kidney diseases. The considerable practical value of the model's high accuracy lies in its capacity to accelerate the diagnostic process and provide valuable assistance to healthcare professionals in making well-informed judgements. The present study work offers a comprehensive description of the methods used, including data preparation, model design, and the fine-tuning procedure. Moreover, it explores the significance of interpretability and model explain ability within the medical field. In addition, we provide a comparative study of our fine-tuned EfficientNet-B3 model in comparison to other frequently used designs, emphasizing its better performance. Moreover, this research highlights the significant importance of deep learning models in enhancing the diagnosis of kidney illness and their capacity to assist healthcare professionals in making more precise and prompt judgements, eventually resulting in improved patient outcomes.

AB  - Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are widely used in medical images diagnostic research, because they can automatically learn powerful and robust feature representations. However, their performance might be significantly deteriorated by trivial or corrupted medical features and samples. Moreover, existing methods cannot simultaneously interpret the significant features and samples. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we propose a novel dual interpretable graph convolutional network, namely FSNet, to simultaneously select significant features and samples, so as to boost model performance for medical diagnosis and interpretation. Specifically, the proposed network consists of three modules, two of which leverage one simple yet effective sparse mechanism to obtain feature and sample weight matrices for interpreting features and samples, respectively, and the third one is utilized for medical diagnosis. Extensive experiments on the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) datasets demonstrate the superior classification performance and interpretability over the recent state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - In recent years cyber security attacks have become a growing concern in healthcare as it involves sensitive data. In 2021 a significant raise in the ransomware attacks has been observed in the medical sector, resulting in disruption in monitoring patients, cancelled appointments, and diverted ambulances. These incidents lead to delays in offering medication, which can potentially trigger life-threatening risks for patients. To address these alarming circumstances Blockchain is considered as the most promising technology to combat against this emergent threat because of its decentralised, immutable, and transparent nature. Therefore, this paper presents a comprehensive investigation on Blockchain applications for healthcare, including different cyber security attacks on medical data, its different types and features, the consensus algorithms, and its integration with other technologies in the healthcare sector. Additionally, a review on the existing Blockchain-based secured and cost-efficient frameworks is presented that highlights their appropriateness in exchanging medical data. In order to overcome the lacking in existing frameworks a new design has been proposed addressing several features including security, cost-efficiency, privacy, transparency, scalability, interoperability integrating several technologies like Blockchain, Edge-Fog-Cloud architecture, IoT, and AI. The aim of this work is to explore the promising potential of Blockchain for the exchange of efficient medical data. Furthermore, this work analyses the existing Blockchain-based paradigms for secure and cost-efficient healthcare data sharing, and it proposes possible directions that are required to be addressed for the seamless medical data exchange along with implementing those to improve the proposed framework.

AB  - Predicting the health risks of patients based on electronic health records (EHRs) has recently attracted considerable research interest. Health risk refers to the probability of the occurrence of a specific health outcome for a specific patient. The predicted risks of a specific health outcome can be used to support decisions by healthcare professionals. Various predictive models have been developed. Compared with traditional machine learning models, deep learning-based models have achieved more promising performance. However, due to the lack of transparency, the acceptance of deep learning-based models are often limited. This paper proposes a Stacked Attention-based Network, SANet, for accurate and interpretable health risk prediction. Two novel attention-based modules, named Convolutional Attention Module and Sequential Attention Module respectively, are designed to capture patient-specific contextual information at both feature and sequence levels. Particularly, Sequential Attention Module can flexibly learn the impact of the time interval between sequential visits and significantly enhance the interpretability and robustness of learning outcomes from sequences. Experimental results on two real-world EHR datasets demonstrate the superior predictive accuracy of our method, as well as interpretability and robustness, compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. The findings extracted by this approach are also empirically confirmed by relevant literature and medical experts.

AB  - With the advent of revolutionary technologies, the Internet of Things (IoT) has proved its effectiveness in the medical sector. The inclusion of sensors in IoT devices enables connectivity and facilitates the collection of valuable data for patient monitoring and effective treatment methods. Sensors are tagged with the medical equipment and foster real-time tracking of medical devices such as oxygen pumps, nebulizers, wheelchairs, etc. It collects medical data that has the patient's personal and sensitive information regarding medical history, such as heart rate, diagnosis information, drug prescription, body temperature, etc. However, the security of medical data has become a significant concern. Therefore, this paper proposes an artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain-enabled scheme that offer cyber security to medical IoT data. Here, different machine learning (ML) classifiers, such as decision tree (DT), K-Nearest neighbor (KNN), Naive Bayes (NB), support vector machine (SVM), and gradient boosting classifier (GBC) are used to classify medical IoT data as an attack (1) and normal (0) class. Then, an IPFS-based blockchain network is used to offer security and transparency to the medical IoT data. Moreover, for evaluation, different performance metrics are considered, such as accuracy, training time, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and scalability. Among all ML classifiers, KNN achieves the highest accuracy of 95.4%.

AB  - Over the past two decades, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) have emerged as critical components in various industries, integrating digital and physical elements to improve efficiency and automation, from smart manufacturing and autonomous vehicles to advanced healthcare devices. However, the increasing complexity of CPS and their deployment in highly dynamic contexts undermine user trust. This motivates the investigation of methods capable of generating explanations about the behavior of CPS. To this end, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methodologies show potential. However, these approaches do not consider contextual variables that a CPS may be subjected to (e.g., temperature, humidity), and the provided explanations are typically not actionable. In this article, we propose an Actionable Contextual Explanation System (ACES) that considers such contextual influences. Based on a user query about a behavioral attribute of a CPS (for example, vibrations and speed), ACES creates contextual explanations for the behavior of such a CPS considering its context. To generate contextual explanations, ACES uses a context model to discover sensors and actuators in the physical environment of a CPS and obtains time-series data from these devices. It then cross-correlates these time-series logs with the user-specified behavioral attribute of the CPS. Finally, ACES employs a counterfactual explanation method and takes user feedback to identify causal relationships between the contextual variables and the behavior of the CPS. We demonstrate our approach with a synthetic use case; the favorable results obtained, motivate the future deployment of ACES in real-world scenarios.

AB  - Aiming at the problems of variability of industrial bearing fault information, difficulty of network model hyperparameter optimization and low reliability of model decision, a fault identification and diagnostic method of SSA-DarkNet-19 and Sparrow Search Algorithm was proposed. First of all, by using a two-dimensional wavelet transform to a time-frequency image, the bearing original vibration signal data is preprocessed, and the corresponding target data set is constructed. Then, the data sets with the SNR of 10dB∼20dB are used to test the anti-noise performance of three selected deep learning networks, and the network framework with better anti-noise performance is obtained. Then, the mesh method is used to study the parameters, and a set of good hyperparameters is obtained by combining the Sparrow optimization algorithm (SSA). Finally, the interpretability of network parameter optimization and decision-making results is studied by using t-SNE and class activation mapping. The bearing data from CWRU shows that the method proposed in this thesis can achieve high fault diagnosis accuracy under certain noise, has strong interpretability, and has good application prospects.

AB  - Clinical coding is an administrative function in hospitals, which involves the transformation of clinical notes into structured codes that can be analyzed statistically. Coding data has a number of benefits, including speeding up the administration process of insurance companies and hospitals, improving global data sharing, and facilitating statistical analysis and forecasting. Current healthcare practice involves an individual as a clinical coder interpreting information about an aspect of patient care and assigning standardised codes. Thus, the current manual coding process is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and error-prone. Computer-assisted coding has emerged in the healthcare industry in recent years. AI-based systems together with expert-led services can help reduce labor costs, facilitate the administration process, and provide more informed and efficient healthcare. Consequently, researchers are increasingly interested in the use of deep neural networks to automate the process of clinical coding. The objective of this brief literature review is to summarize and describe the characteristics of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), list the commonly used ICD-coded datasets, discuss the state-of-the-art deep learning models for ICD coding and the effect of injecting ICD ontology into these models, and present the interpretability mechanism that have been developed and implemented for clinical coding.

AB  - The significant success of deep learning has sparked interest in its application in medical diagnosis. Some deep learning models have achieved expert-level accuracy on some medical datasets, but these models are rarely used in clinical practice due to the lack of interpretability. Therefore, the research topic of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has emerged to make the reasoning process of the model transparent and interpretable. In this case, we applied interpretable artificial intelligence to dermatoscopy image diagnosis for the first time. Specifically, we use an interpretable prototype network for dermoscopy image diagnosis. To solve the problem of weak generalization performance of a single network, we propose to construct a new prototype network using the dual-path network. Besides, we propose a new gate similarity calculation method to reduce the activation of low-similarity regions, thereby reducing the generation of inaccurate prototypes and improving the diagnostic ability of the model. We conducted experiments on the dermoscopy datasets HAM10000 to test the model and compare it with other baseline models. Experimental results show that DP-ProtoNet has made improvements in accuracy while preserving the interpretability of the model.

AB  - Facial Action Unit (AU) detection is of major importance in a broad range of artificial intelligence applications such as healthcare, Facial Expression Recognition (FER), and mental state analysis. In this paper, we present an innovative, resource-efficient facial AU detection model, embedding both spatial and channel attention mechanisms into a convolutional neural network (CNN). Along with a unique data input system leveraging image data and binary-encoded AU activation labels, our model enhances AU detection capabilities while simultaneously offering interpretability for FER systems. In contrast to existing state-of-the-art models, our proposal’s streamlined architecture, combined with superior performance, establishes it as an ideal solution for resource-limited environments like mobile and embedded systems with computational constraints. The model was trained and evaluated utilizing the BP4D, CK+, DISFA, FER2013+, and RAF-DB datasets, with the latter two being particularly significant as they represent wild datasets for facial expression recognition. These datasets encompass ground truth emotions matched with corresponding AU activations according to the Facial Action Coding System. Various metrics, including F1 score, accuracy, and Euclidean distance, showcase its effectiveness in AU detection and interpretability.

AB  - The approaches based on deep learning have achieved remarkable success in diabetic retinopathy detection. Due to the accountability in medical diagnosis, the interpretability of computer-aided diagnosis has recently been investigated. However, few existing approaches make full use of the explainable evidence to improve the diagnosis accuracy. In this paper, we propose a Model-free Lesion Generation and Learning (MLGL) framework to study the interpretability of diabetic retinopathy detection. We first generate visual explanations for diabetic retinopathy diagnosis using the proposed Gated Multi-layer Saliency Map (GMSM) module, which locates the accurate region of lesions by combining multi-layer heatmaps. Then we use the GMSM to extract the lesion patches and conduct the adaptive lesion transfer, iteratively generating new retinal fundus images with lesions. Especially, in this process, no additional generative models are trained. Finally, we merge the generated and original retinal fundus images for the model's training to learn robust lesion features. Overall, our method provides accurate explainable evidence and further addresses the data imbalance problem in diabetic retinopathy detection. The experimental results on four public datasets demonstrate the efficiency of our approach.

AB  - Content-based medical image retrieval is an important diagnostic tool that improves the explainability of computer-aided diagnosis systems and provides decision-making support to healthcare professionals. A common approach to content-based image retrieval is learning a distance metric by transforming images into a feature space where the distance between samples is a similarity measure. Proxy metric learning methods are effective at learning this transformation due to the use of proxy feature vectors that enable efficient learning. Training with a distance-based classification loss enables a single proxy model to be suitable for both retrieval and classification. However, these methods are designed only for single-label data, making them unsuitable for multimorbidity medical images. Addressing this, we propose a novel multi-label proxy metric learning method for content-based image retrieval and classification. Unlike existing proxy-based methods, training samples assign to multiple proxies that span multiple class labels. This results in a feature space that encodes the complex relationships between diseases. We introduce negative proxies to better encode the relationships between samples without detected diseases. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated experimentally on two multimorbidity radiology datasets. Results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art image retrieval systems and baseline approaches. Our method is clinically significant as it improves on two key factors shown to affect medical professionals’ willingness to use computer-aided diagnosis systems: accuracy and interpretability.

AB  - With the increasing use of big data, cloud computing, and machine learning in high-stake domains such as justice systems, financial institutions, and healthcare, concerns about fairness have become more prominent. This paper presents a novel approach to foster fair decision-making by tackling social bias and enhancing transparency in machine learning models. The proposed framework leverages quantum-inspired complex-valued neural networks and attention-based networks, offering improved transparency in modeling the decision process for interpreting feature importance and dependency. Furthermore, our approach tackles the challenges posed by imbalanced data through the incorporation of focal loss and oversampling techniques, resulting in reduced prediction errors. Through extensive experiments conducted on real-life datasets encompassing criminal charge prediction, financial fraud detection, and credit card default payment prediction, our approach consistently demonstrates reliable prediction precision and recall. Notably, our analysis of feature significance highlights the statistical importance of task-related features such as historical records of bank transactions or criminal charge history, while socially biased identifiers like race, gender, and age exhibit minimal significance. By excluding these biased features, our approach enhances fairness without compromising prediction accuracy, thereby contributing to the advancement of fair decision-making in big data and cloud computing across various high-stake domains.

AB  - Caregiving for spouses with Alzheimer’s disease or related dementias (ADRD) is one of the most stressful experiences. Evidence-based treatments for caregivers who have a high risk of mental health issues are needed. In this study, we designed models for predicting changes in perceived stress scale (PSS) (increase/not increase) in one week and generated some examples of counterfactual (’what-if’) explanations to change the stress state for helping manage stress. Using self-report (positive and negative affect and sleep quality) and sensor data (heart rate, sleep, and steps) collected in 132 week-long study sessions from 57 participants, we compared explainable PSS change prediction models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, EBM, and Neural Network) along with ’what-if’ explanations. First, we developed machine learning models for classifying the change in PSS scores before and after the session period. Second, we identified feature importance using our explainable models. Our results showed that XGBoost performed the best with an accuracy of 0.79 and an F1 score of 0.78 for predicting changes in perceived stress. Our results also showed that minimum heart rate, mean steps per day, and negative affect are the most predictive features. Our preliminary counterfactual examples about sleep parameters would be able to provide suggestions for improving one’s health. We discussed our ideas to provide better suggestions using DiCE.

AB  - Cardiovascular disorders (CVD) are the key cause of mortality worldwide. One in three male premature deaths and one in five female premature deaths are thought to be attributable to Cardiovascular disorders. Early prediction of CVDs may help to attenuate the disease, potentially lowering death rates. The existence of cardiac disease can be predicted using machine learning approaches; however, the effectiveness of the classifiers may be enhanced by applying PCA, relief feature selection, and data transformation techniques. The objective of employing data transformation, PCA, and relief feature selection approaches is to enhance classifier performance and increase the interpretability and ability of classifiers to predict heart disease. Heart disease anticipating is a challenging problem in the field of healthcare. This uses popular supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms including k-NN, LR, DT, RF, SVM, and ANN to help healthcare practitioners and specialists easily identify the prevalence of heart-related illnesses in patients. In these trials, data transformation is achieved using PCA, normalized features, and relief techniques, and RF surpasses all other classifiers with a prediction accuracy of 90%, followed by ANN and DT with AUCs of 87% and 86%, respectively. SVM and Naive Bayes classifiers were shown to be lesser effective at predicting heart disease.

AB  - Living in a major metropolitan area has been linked to an increased risk of developing multiple forms of chronic-kidney-disease(CKD). In developed nations, predicting CKDs is a top priority. Predictive analytics for the purpose of predicting CKDs are the primary focus of this work. However, it is getting harder and harder to forecast outcomes for massive samples. While doing so, the MapReduce architecture makes it possible to write predictive algorithms by combining map and reduce operations. Problems with the scalability and effectiveness of anticipative learning approaches are alleviated by the comparatively straightforward programming interface. To efficiently handle small subsets of massive datasets, the authors propose using an iterative weighted mapreduce approach. Ensemble-nonlinear support-vector-machines(ENSVM) and random-forests(RF) are used to design a binary classification issue. As a result, the suggested approach generates nonlinear blends of kernel activations in example prototypes, as opposed to the conventional linear combination of activations. In addition, an ensemble of deep-SVM is utilized to integrate the descriptors, with the product rule being employed to merge the classifiers' likelihood estimates. Prediction accuracy and results interpretability are used to gauge performance.

AB  - Advanced robotics, high-speed networking, and real-time haptics have opened a myriad of opportunities to extend telesurgery in Metaverse environments. The telesurgery metaverse (TMs) offers high-quality, immersive, and interactive surgical scenarios. Despite the remarkable progress, TMs suffer from operational threats against quantum-adversarial attacks, which can jeopardize the integrity, reliability, and safety of operated patients. The paper presents a novel framework Quant-Meta, that integrates quantum key distribution (QKD) in TM through the BB84 protocol. A framework is presented for TM, where the surgeon communicates via gestures that are communicated securely to the robotic arm present in a metaverse environment. A quantum channel sets up the BB84 key distribution, and the sender and receiver agree to the shared key. Once it is set up, the communication is supported by a 6G-envisioned tactile internet (TI) channel. which assures high reliability. To ensure high precision, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is integrated with the trained model to predict doctor gestures. The framework is analyzed in terms of BB84 protocol design, and quantum channel parameters. The result signifies a high probability of intruder detection and a 19.87 % improvement in channel transmission rate. The quantum bit error rate also likes below 4 %, with a high sifted key rate. The results indicate the potential viability of the framework in practical telesurgical deployments.
