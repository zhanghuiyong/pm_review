AB  - Liver disease represents a serious medical problem which remains unnoticed until later stages because the earliest symptoms are minimal and difficult to identify. The research develops an artificial intelligence framework to enhance liver disease diagnosis through the analysis of structured medical records. The preprocessing of the dataset involved using Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE) with variable imputation and encoding and scaling features and balancing classes. The core indicators that emerged from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) included age together with bilirubin levels along with albumin levels and protein levels. The Gradient Boosting and Extra Trees ensemble combined with Random Forest and XGBoost operated on an 80/20 split to perform performance analysis. Both XGBoost and Random Forest demonstrated reliable performance where XGBoost achieved 90.1% ROC-AUC and 77.6% accuracy while Random Forest had 81.3% accuracy but with 89.9% ROC-AUC. ROC-AUC measures revealed that Gradient Boosting and Extra Trees produced results comparable to each other when evaluated at 89.2% and 88.7% respectively. The research proves that combination models along with SMOTE augmentation and feature visualization systems demonstrate success in liver disease detection. The future work will integrate patient medical backgrounds and implement explainable AI systems and distributed learning models to preserve data privacy across various healthcare facilities thus enabling real-time diagnosis decisions in liver treatment settings.

AB  - Lung cancer continues to be among the deadliest illnesses globally, calling for early and precise diagnosis for better patient outcomes. This research introduces an automated system of lung cancer diagnosis via deep learning and medical imaging. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was constructed and trained using a balanced data set of 200 CT scan images, with 100 malignant and 100 benign cases. The dataset was preprocessed by reducing noise, enhancing contrast, and augmenting to enhance robustness. The CNN model consisted of four layers of convolution for feature extraction, max-pooling layers to reduce dimensions, and fully connected layers for classification. The model was trained with the Adam optimizer and trained for more than 30 epochs. Performance on the test set achieved accuracy of 92.5 %, precision of 91.2 %, recall of 93.8 %, and an F1-score of 92.5 %, validating its performance in identifying malignant versus benign cases. Comparison with VGG16 and ResNet50 verified better performance, and mean processing time of 2.5 seconds per image assured applicability in real-time systems. Error analysis revealed slight misclassifications from overlapping features and tiny tumor sizes. The research emphasizes the promise of AIbased diagnostic instruments in medical imaging and recommends improvement in the future, such as training on large datasets and adding explainable AI for better interpretability and clinician adoption.

AB  - NAS can find better solutions by exploring the vast search space for possible architectures and is widely used in medical AI. However, due to its black-box nature, explainability is important for NAS-assisted medical AI applications. In this paper, we design and implement a risk prediction model for amyloidosis (a rare hematological disease) using an evolutionary neural architecture search (ENAS) to automatically find the best model architecture. To improve the professional acceptance of this prediction model among clinicians, we introduce the concept of result interpretability. Meanwhile, we propose a framework for medical AI systems that can interpret results, utilizing a large language model. The realization of the system provides a more feasible way to apply AI-assisted medical diagnosis on a large scale.

AB  - Palliative care (PC) and hospice care emphasize the relief of the suffering of life-threatening serious conditions such as cancer, with a focus on the integration of palliative cancer care (PCC) into the health care systems to achieve universal health coverage and promote well-being. Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into PCC requires a tailored policy framework to navigate challenges such as costs, data barriers, and workflow integration. Emerging AI technologies show promise in screening for psychological distress and enhancing care delivery, yet regulatory environments remain in their early stages of development. Legislative strategies must adapt to the rapidly evolving AI landscape, with a particular focus on addressing gaps in AI governance specific to palliative care. Transparency, privacy protection, and ethical considerations to ensure equitable access to medications and therapies are paramount in the regulatory framework for AI applications in healthcare. Moving forward, collaboration among stakeholders is essential to ensure ethical priorities are met, and further innovative research is needed to explore domain-specific details and complete disability policies for the optimal integration of AI in palliative care. This paper aims to increase the awareness of policymakers and the public about the size of the addressed problem, the suffering associated with cancer, the importance of PCC as a human right and responsibility, and its integration with cancer disease management strategies to provide more comprehensive cancer care.

AB  - The timely management of an unruptured aneurysm can prevent hemorrhage. Multiple anatomical, morphological, and hemodynamic features associated with an aneurysm can predict the risk of rupture and classify the nature of the aneurysm as either ruptured or unruptured. However, considering all features may create ambiguities in the model due to inter-dependencies, such as the correlation between aneurysm height and width to aneurysm area. In computer-aided medical diagnostics, focusing on relevant features that diagnose the disease is more crucial than using an abundance of features that may not contribute to the diagnosis and may cause unnecessary complexity. The use of independent or sparsely correlated features improves the accuracy of the classifier. The proposed research analyzes the interdependency of features by calculating the correlation between features. Based on the analyses, the high correlation threshold is determined through rigorous experimentation. From the highly correlated features, one feature is selected. Consequently, the reduced feature set is recommended. The reduced feature set performs better with simpler classifiers. Instead of choosing a classifier that struggles with a broad range of features, an appropriately optimized feature set can enhance performance and improve accuracy. The proposed approach is tested on a publicly available dataset of aneurysms, leading to an improvement in classification accuracy from 82.6% to 87%, due to the use of an appropriate feature set. Moreover, the best model was evaluated using two different explainable AI frameworks to assess the contribution of each feature in prediction. However, the conflicting feature prioritization in each explainable framework suggests that these models prioritize different features for the same trained model, leading to ambiguity. This inconsistency indicates that the explainable models lack generalization and fail to consistently analyze feature importance.

AB  - Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like diabetes, heart disease, Parkinson's disease, and breast cancer are leading causes of global mortality and morbidity. Early detection is crucial to improve outcomes and reduce healthcare costs, but traditional diagnostic methods are often inaccessible in low- resource settings. This study leverages machine learning (ML) to develop a unified Multiple Disease Prediction System using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Datasets were pre-processed to handle missing data and ensure feature scaling, resulting in high accuracy, recall, and F1-scores across diseases. The system achieved its best performance with Random Forest and SVM algorithms. Random Forest produced consistent accuracy for Parkinson's disease (94.87%) and breast cancer (98.83%), whereas SVM performed well with high-dimensional data sets like breast cancer (98.25%) and Parkinson's disease (94.87%). Logistic Regression, though simpler, demonstrated competitive performance for diabetes (75.32%) and heart disease (85.25%). The models were deployed via a simple-to-use Streamlit web app, enabling real-time, accessible medical forecasts providers and individuals. The research identifies concerns such as dataset heterogeneity and computational complexity, and proposing future directions such as real-time data integration, cloud-based scalability, and explainable AI. This article demonstrates ML's ability to revolutionize early disease diagnosis and enhance global health access.

AB  - Colon cancer is still a major worldwide health concern, and reliable and understandable diagnostic methods are required. Although the existing deep learning models are quite good at classifying images, they are opaque, which makes it difficult to use them in clinical situations. Current approaches frequently depend on intricate models that yield precise forecasts but are not easily interpreted. In response, this paper suggests a unique method of utilizing CNN-SHAP (Convolutional Neural Network - SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret colon cancer forecasts. Convolutional neural networks and SHAP values are integrated by CNN-SHAP, which makes it possible to identify important picture aspects that influence predictions. The integration improves transparency of the model, which is important for decision-making and clinical trust. An extensive dataset of colonoscopy pictures and related clinical results was gathered for this study. Afterwards, a unique CNN architecture suited for colonoscopy image processing was built and trained. Then, incorporate SHAP to determine the feature attributions for every prediction. The locations inside the photos that were crucial to the model's decision-making process were highlighted using the SHAP values visualization. As compared to conventional CNNs, the results showed not only great predicted accuracy but also improved interpretability. Healthcare practitioners were given practical insights by CNN-SHAP's identification of clinically significant traits, which were confirmed by histological results. By bridging the gap between deep learning research and clinical application, this work helps to increase confidence in 99.2% accurate AI-driven colon cancer detection tools. Python was used for the implementation.

AB  - Access to clean drinking water is critical to public health and well - being. Water compatibility refers to the safety of drinking water for human consumption and includes various physical, chemical and biological parameters. Contaminated water can cause serious health problems, particularly among vulnerable populations due to water-borne diseases. Traditionally, water quality assessment relies on time - consuming laboratory tests that can delay responses to contamination. The H2OGuard project presents a novel approach: It uses deep learning and machine learning algorithms to predict water sustainability based on key environmental factors such as pH, turbidity and chemical contaminants. With these advanced methods, we aim to improve the efficiency and accuracy of water quality testing. In addition, the integration of blockchain technology is intended to ensure secure and immutable storage of water quality data and promote integrity and transparency. This paper discusses the methods of the H2OGuard project, evaluates the performance of various predictive models, and highlights the critical importance of blockchain in securing data. With this innovative framework, we aim to enable more efficient and timely assessment of drinking water safety, ultimately contributing to improved public health outcomes.

AB  - As machine learning models grow in complexity, interpretability often takes a backseat to predictive accuracy. While this tradeoff may be acceptable in some domains, it poses significant challenges in high-stakes fields such as healthcare, finance, and law, where model transparency is critical. Traditional methods, such as Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), offer high interpretability but suffer from limited flexibility and scalability. In contrast, deep learning models provide superior accuracy but often lack transparency. This thesis introduces a novel approach that fuses the interpretability of GAMs with the adaptability of neural networks. By leveraging neural network architectures, I propose an open-source framework that emulates the structural simplicity of GAMs while preserving the expressive power of modern deep learning methods. The method demonstrates competitive performance with state-of-the-art techniques in terms of accuracy while offering greater insight into model behavior. I provide empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets, highlighting the advantages and limitations of the framework, and propose directions for future research to refine this balance between transparency and predictive power.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is an insidious ocular complication, with its initial stages being asymptomatic; therefore, accurate detection at an early stage is required to prevent severe complications. It describes a study which compares logistic regression to random forest models for diabetic retinopathy classification. The results indicate that for the purpose of diabetic retinopathy classification, the Logistic Regression is the strongest model from the point of view of recall and F1 score, both of which are critical to medical diagnostics, where false negatives should be minimized. Logistic Regression has better interpretability and thus is used for clinical decision-makers. Random forest is good to manage non-linear relation which indicates its strong model, however, lower F1 score gives us an information of it's not a good balance between precision and recall. Furthermore, future work can further improve classification performance by exploiting ensemble learning, performing feature engineering, and integrating deep learning. This work advances machine learning-based tests for diabetic retinopathy and highlights the need for high-recall models for use in medical screening.

AB  - Skin cancer remains a global health challenge, with early detection vital to reducing mortality. This paper proposes a dual-stream deep learning framework for classifying seven skin lesion types from dermatoscopic images. The architecture combines ResNet101 and DenseNet121 to capture both hierarchical and multi-scale texture features. To tackle data imbalance, we apply adaptive histogram equalization, SMOTE, and focal loss. Feature fusion is performed via a dynamic attention mechanism, reducing parameter redundancy by 30% compared to standard concatenation. Validated on 1,532 real-world cases, the model achieves 95.2% accuracy, 0.983 AUC, and 93.9% sensitivity for melanoma detection, with 93.4% concordance with histopathology. It shows strong generalization across Fitzpatrick skin types (≤5% variance) and runs in 87 ms on ARM devices using TensorFlow Lite. Clinically, it reduces diagnostic latency in rural clinics from 14 days to 23 seconds. This work delivers a scalable, interpretable, and bias-aware AI tool for global skin cancer screening. Code and pre-trained weights are open-sourced.

AB  - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown tremendous potential in medical image processing, particularly for the classification of endoscopic images. Endoscopic Image Classification using Machine Learning Algorithms (EIC-MLA) leverages GANs to enhance image generation and classification accuracy, enabling better diagnosis in gastrointestinal examinations. Existing methods for endoscopic image classification often suffer from low accuracy due to challenges such as poor image quality, limited datasets, and difficulty in differentiating between healthy and abnormal tissues. These issues hinder the reliability and precision of automated diagnostic systems. The proposed EIC-MLA framework addresses these limitations by utilizing a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model to improve data augmentation and enhance image quality, which is critical for accurate classification. The GAN-based framework generates high-quality synthetic images that closely mimic real endoscopic images, thereby expanding the training dataset and improving the performance of the classification algorithm. This method applies GAN-generated images in conjunction with a machine learning classifier to improve the differentiation between normal and abnormal tissue, enhancing diagnostic reliability. The integration of deep learning with GANs allows for a more robust classification model that can handle variations in image quality and appearance. The outcome of the proposed method demonstrates improved accuracy in endoscopic image classification, offering more precise and reliable diagnostic support. The enhanced performance of the EIC-MLA framework suggests that it could significantly contribute to the early detection of gastrointestinal diseases, improving patient outcomes. The EIC-MLA framework demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving 97.14% accuracy, 93.17% early detection, 98.29% improved patient outcomes, 95.11% image quality enhancement, and 98.31 % diagnostic reliability.

AB  - Machine learning (ML) approaches have been employed to forecast drug-target interactions as an attempt at quick drug discovery. The objective is to analyze several ML models, such as decision trees, SVMs, random forests, and neural networks, on their capacity to predict drug candidates' medical potential based on molecular properties. Data Preprocessing and ML Algorithms: The approach follows a few steps; the first is the preprocessing of a large dataset, which implies drug-target interaction data; after this step, the application of the numerous ML algorithms. The performance of the model is evaluated using important assessment measures such as accuracy, F1-score, and area under the curve (AUC), and the optimum approach is found for drug-target prediction. The results reveal that ensembles, specifically random forests, outperform other approaches in predicting accuracy and robustness. The results underline the potential of employing machine learning algorithms to assist the drug discovery process by permitting speedier and more precise identification of therapeutic candidates, thereby decreasing the time and cost associated with current experimental approaches. It is crucial to highlight that while there are significant limitations to this study, including difficulties of model interpretability and dataset generalization, it is obvious that ML can help the drug discovery process overall. Overall, this study adds to the growing body of literature in the domain of computational drug discovery, with possible implications for the more accurate prediction of pharmacological efficacy and toxicity through machine learning methodologies. Indeed, the next natural step would be to combine multi-omics data with clinical information to refine medication predictions and enable tailored therapy.

AB  - The recent outbreak of the Monkeypox virus (MPXV) has necessitated the development of certain vaccine strategies that are effective and safe. This paper introduces a novel computational approach for the prediction of MPXV- specific B-cell epitopes using a deep learning model with a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), and an attention mechanism. A bespoke dataset was assembled from experimentally confirmed orthopoxvirus protein sequences, permitting MPXV- specific predictions. Post-prediction toxicity assessment filters out toxic peptides, ensuring vaccine safety. To render the output more explainable and clinically relevant, a Large Language Model (LLM) layer provides explanations of the selected epitopes in an intelligible human-formatted manner. This integrated pipeline, aligning with Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-Being), is a big leap forward in AI-mediated transparent and ethical vaccine design for future viral threats.

AB  - The success of Machine Learning (ML) models in healthcare relies heavily on the quality of data used. High-quality data are crucial for improving the predictive capabilities and the overall performance of ML systems. Despite this, research on data quality in healthcare and ML remains limited, with varying definitions of issues and dimensions across contexts. This study introduces a structured, expert-driven framework for prioritizing data quality dimensions critical to ML performance in healthcare. In contrast to performance evaluation studies involving machine learning algorithms or classifiers, this research does not encompass the training or comparison of predictive models. It addresses a key gap in ML data control by integrating ISO/IEC 25012 with Priestley’s classification and using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to evaluate 15 dimensions based on expert judgment. The findings identify Completeness (21.25%), Accuracy (15.53%), Consistency (14.31%), Currentness (14.82%), and Precision (13.82%) as the most influential dimensions for ML healthcare outcomes. A One-at-a-Time (OAT) sensitivity analysis with ±17.6% perturbation confirms the robustness of prioritization despite expert input variability. Key contributions include: 1) a tailored framework for ML healthcare data; 2) AHP-based dimension prioritization; 3) validation through sensitivity testing; 4) insights into data quality’s impact on ML fairness and transparency; and 5) practical guidance for data governance and resource allocation. Future work will apply this framework to clinical datasets to validate its effectiveness in enhancing ML model performance and generalizability.

AB  - This paper examines innovative approaches to tackling the challenges of high-frequency stock market prediction Predicting the high-frequency stock market always was a kind of challenging task with fast-moving data streams and inherent non-linear relationships of financial markets, thus the hour for developing hybrid deep learning models from traditional statistical models has come. This research seeks to examine the efficacy of hybrid models, particularly the integration of LSTM networks with CNNs, to enhance prediction performance on high-frequency stock market data. A thorough review of contemporary studies on hybrid model architectures, data sets, preprocessing techniques, and practical problems such as computational complexity and real-time implementation challenges was conducted. Hybrid models effectively capture the advantages of extracting temporal dependencies along with spatial interdependencies. The performance of standalone models is compared on superior predictive accuracy and real-time applicability against the hybrid models. Other such entities in this direction are data preprocessing methods and model interpretability, which further enhance predictive performance. Hybrid models carry vast potential in high-frequency trading applications by enabling smart, data-driven financial decision-making. Future work is warranted to focus on scalability, robustness, and better interpretability for wider market applications. This study has not been registered in any systematic review.

AB  - The worldwide increase in cardiovascular diseases and related deaths necessitates advanced, non-invasive diagnostic methods that allow for timely detection and intervention to mitigate the risk of death. This study analyzes phonocardiogram (PCG) heart sound (HS) classification using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. To improve accuracy and data diversity, two well-known datasets—PhysioNet CinC Challenge 2016 and CirCor 2022—were fused after resampling and label harmonization. ML algorithms like XGBoost and LightGBM, and DL algorithms like CNN+BiLSTM Attention and CBAM ResNet were incorporated to train the models leveraging the Mel-frequency ceptral coefficients as key acoustic features. Evaluation was performed using the stratified k-fold cross-validation with bootstrapping utilized multiple orthogonal metrics like sensitivity, specificity, F1- score, ROC-AUC alongside accuracy computed over all folds. The results analysis revealed 95.21% accuracy for the ResNet + CBAM model the best performers followed by CNN + BiLSTM at 94.01%. While ML models provided quicker inference and interpretability, DL models exhibited better generalization as well as greater sensitivity to intricate HS, particularly the quadruple rhythm. The findings reinforce the importance of dataset fusion and evaluation of hybrid models for the creation of clinically usable diagnostic systems. With this hybrid model approach, the proposed framework has advanced responsive capability for early detection of CVD even in constrained healthcare environments.

AB  - This study presents VitaChat, a sophisticated conversational AI framework intended to improve patients' and healthcare providers' access to trustworthy antibiotic-related information. The two main stages of the suggested system's operation are the processing and embedding of reliable medical texts and the retrieval and production of contextually appropriate responses. The first stage encodes information from three antibiotic reference books using the LangChain framework and a Sentence Transformer model. The embeddings are then stored in a ChromaDB vector store for effective similarity-based retrieval. In order to ensure transparency and reliability, the second phase uses a query-driven retrieval mechanism to provide precise, source-grounded responses with citations. Across a range of user skill levels, this integrated approach provides easy access to vital antibiotic information, such as indications, side effects, and usage. VitaChat's superior performance in response accuracy and usability is demonstrated by rigorous evaluation across a variety of query types and user scenarios, solidifying its position as a reliable tool for bridging the gap between accessible healthcare communication and complex medical knowledge. The suggested framework emphasises how machine learning and natural language processing can help healthcare settings make well-informed decisions.

AB  - Thyroid cancer marks the most frequent endocrine cancer while having high recurrence potential, necessitating accurate future disease predictions. The proposed research develops a combined machine learning system that integrates stacked ensembles and ensemble voting models alongside feature reduction strategies to improve thyroid cancer recurrence predictions. A clinical and demographic dataset was analyzed using multiple ML models, including XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Logistic Regression. The models were evaluated based on key metrics such as accuracy, AUC-ROC, precision, recall, and F1-score. Logistic Regression showed 88.77% predictive ability, while LightGBM achieved 88.25% according to individual model results. The ensemble voting model, which aggregates multiple classifiers' probabilistic outputs, demonstrated improved predictive stability, while the stacked ensemble model surpassed all other individual predictors, attaining the highest accuracy (90.91%) and an AUC-ROC value of 97.27%. To improve model interpretability, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was employed, identifying cancer stage, risk classification, and patient age as the most influential predictors. The findings demonstrate that ensemble learning techniques, including stacked and voting-based models, not only enhance predictive accuracy but also improve model robustness and reliability. The research integrates explainable AI components to connect sophisticated black-box ML models with clinical treatment decisions, thus enabling healthcare providers to make individualized patient-risk assessments. The proposed framework based on AI functions as the groundwork to create clinical decision support systems that improve prognosis evaluation and individualized treatment development for thyroid cancer patients.

AB  - Chest cancer continues to be among the leading killers of cancer across the globe, and therefore an early and accurate diagnosis plays a crucial role in raising survival rates and success of treatments. In this study, we investigate how deep models, i.e., Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), are employed for chest cancer image classification. We utilized four state-of-the-art CNN architectures, i.e., Xception, DenseNet121, and MobileNetV2, InceptionV3 to classify chest cancer images into four categories: Adenocarcinoma, Large Cell Carcinina, Squamous Cell Carcinoma, and Normal. These models were conditioned on a diversified dataset of images of chest cancers, and while trying to increase the interpretability of the Xception model, we utilized saliency mapping, using which we were able to display those parts of the image influencing the model's decision. Even individual models with single model designs promised good performance, but hybrid implementations using Vision Transformer (ViT) in conjunction with MobileNetV2 and DenseNet121 worked better. Specifically, ViT + MobileNetV2 was a staggering 99% accurate, and ViT + DenseNet121 was 98% accurate. These results illustrate the potential of deep learning models, particularly when combined with advanced techniques like ViTs, to significantly improve diagnosis accuracy for chest cancer, with improved interpretability for clinical applications.

While machine learning models are used for activity classification, visualization techniques have a great deal to provide in model performance improvement, feature selection, and interpretability. This paper examines the impact of visualization techniques on HAR data and demonstrates how visualization can contribute towards improving classification accuracy. Experimental results confirm that feature engineering using visualization-based techniques considerably improves model performance. We assess several visualization approaches, their role in HAR systems, and how they are applied in real-time settings. We also describe how visualization facilitates the interpretation of sensor signals, minimization of misclassification errors, and the extraction of informative activity patterns, which results in robust and interpretable HAR models.

AB  - Purpose: Care and attention during the neonatal period are crucial to preventing negative outcomes. The literature presents artificial intelligence models as promising tools to assist healthcare professionals in disease prediction and support clinical decision-making. Methods: This study conducts a bibliometric review of the use of artificial intelligence models in predicting neonatal diseases, conditions and mortality. The review analyzed publications from 2014 to 2024. A total of 629 studies were selected after applying selection criteria. Subsequently, analyses of collaboration networks, keyword co-occurrence, citations and cluster analysis were performed. Results: The results show that the United States, China and the United Kingdom lead scientific production and international collaborations. 12 neonatal diseases were identified, with emphasis on “retinopathy of prematurity”, “necrotizing enterocolitis” and “bronchopulmonary dysplasia”; 7 clinical conditions, including “prematurity”, “perinatal asphyxia” and “jaundice”; and 5 neonatal outcomes, mainly “sepsis”, “mortality” and “cerebral palsy.” Cluster analysis revealed that studies predominantly use clinical, laboratory, genetic and imaging data, with Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Convolutional. Conclusion: The study has growing interest in applying artificial intelligence to neonatal care. The models are increasingly used with clinical, laboratory, genetic and imaging data, enabling earlier and more accurate diagnoses. However, the study also underscores important ethical considerations, such as data quality, algorithmic transparency and equitable access to these technologies, particularly in underrepresented regions, with scientific production uneven and limited participation from low- and middle-income countries.

AB  - Biomarker identification plays a crucial role in understanding disease mechanisms and advancing precision medicine. Existing computational models for biomarker-disease associations predominantly focus on either lncRNA-disease or miRNA-disease relationships, often lacking interpretability and comprehensive network insights. In this study, we propose BioLinker, a hybrid graph-based model that integrates lncRNA, miRNA, and disease associations to enhance biomarker discovery. Our approach leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) and an attention-based ranking mechanism to identify significant biomarker-disease relationships with high interpretability. By mapping numerical identifiers to human-readable biomarker names, our model provides biologically meaningful insights, aiding researchers and clinicians in disease diagnosis and therapeutic target discovery. Experimental validation demonstrates the reliability of BioLinker, achieving an AUC of 99%, ensuring robustness in predictive performance. The proposed model has the potential to facilitate early disease detection, biomarker ranking, and drug discovery, contributing to the advancement of bioinformatics and computational medicine.

AB  - Timely identification of retinal disorders is essential to mitigate the risk of vision impairment or total blindness. This study introduces an innovative and interpretable diagnostic framework that integrates the capabilities of a CNN-based architecture and a Transformer model, followed by visualization using Grad-CAM, to tackle the complexities of multi-label classification in retinal disease analysis. By utilizing OCT imagery, we have developed a specialized hybrid system that synergizes deep learning techniques from convolutional and transformer-based networks to enhance diagnostic accuracy. Beyond classification, this approach provides translucent insights into the decision-making process of the model through activation-based visual explanations, improving trust and interpretability in medical AI applications. The CNN-based model achieved an accuracy rate of 88.88%, while the Transformer-based approach reached 91.39%. However, our optimized hybrid configuration significantly outperformed these standalone models. With an impressive accuracy of 98.8%, this advanced system demonstrates its strong potential in revolutionizing retinal disease detection and assisting healthcare professionals in early intervention.

AB  - Pneumonia is still a major global health threat that calls for enhanced diagnosis to promote the well-being of those affected. In this study, we present an ensemble model that is a combination of DenseNet, MobileNet, and EfficientNet to maximize the identification of pneumonia from CXR images. This model was trained and tested using the dataset from the Kaggle Chest X-ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset which has over 5,000 images and are classified as normal or pneumonia. The pretrained models are fine-tuned using the transfer learning approach to learn different complementary features that are concatenated to produce a powerful feature representation. A fully connected layer with a sigmoid activation function is used for binary classification. By the proposed model, the test accuracy reached 99.24%, which showed the best performance compared with the separate architectures. This work enhances the development of AI based diagnostic systems for pneumonia with regards to both diagnostic accuracy and transparency.

AB  - The healthcare industry is experiencing a major shift with the rise of artificial intelligence. This chatbot can carry out a range of tasks, including assessing symptoms, providing health advice, and suggesting treatments and medical prescription based on a patient's medical history. The idea is to develop a healthcare chatbot that utilizes explainable artificial intelligence to diagnose illnesses and offer basic information about the disease using the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) technique, prior to consultation with a doctor. The chatbot keeps all its information in a database, which it uses to monitor the health condition of a patient. These chatbot uses Variational Autoencoders technique to validate the input and improve the chatbot’s ability to generalize to new and unseen inputs. While health chatbots are not a replacement for professional medical consultation, but they offer a valuable supplementary tool that can enhance the efficiency and accessibility of healthcare monitoring and diagnosis.

AB  - Safety-critical domains, such as healthcare and autonomous vehicles, employ machine learning (ML), where mis-predictions can cause severe repercussions. Training datasets may contain faults, thereby compromising ML accuracy. Ensembles, where multiple ML models vote on predictions, are effective at maintaining predictive capability, and thus resilient against faulty training data because individual models focus on diverse input features. Nevertheless, ensemble diversity varies per input. Hence, weighted ensembles can bolster resilience by assigning unique weights to constituent models. While existing weighted ensembles focus on output-space diversity, we propose leveraging their feature-space diversity to better capture model independence and achieve greater resilience. Therefore, we present ReMlX, which applies explainable artificial intelligence to extract the feature-space diversity of ensemble models, and adjusts their weights to maximize resilience. Compared to its most competitive baseline, ReMlX is 12% more resilient but 15% slower than dynamic weighted ensembles based on stacking.

AB  - The multi-class identification of respiratory diseases based on cough sounds plays a critical role in the diagnosis of respiratory conditions. Compared to traditional auscultation methods, multi-class techniques integrate various deep-level disease features of cough sounds, enabling a more comprehensive capture of cough characteristics associated with specific diseases, thereby effectively reducing the risk of misdiagnosis. Furthermore, multiclass classification enhances the system’s ability to differentiate among multiple respiratory conditions, significantly improving diagnostic accuracy and robustness. This study provides an in-depth examination of artificial intelligence-driven methodologies for multi-class respiratory disease recognition. We reviewed 19 articles from a 5-year open-access literature database to summarize the current research on diagnosing voice-affecting disorders through AI techniques using cough sound samples for multi-class classification. The study also covers AI workflows for multi-class cough recognition, including datasets, feature extraction techniques, models, and evaluation metrics. Additionally, recent advancements in AI technologies, cough monitoring applications, and wearable devices are discussed, along with the challenges and future research directions aimed at developing robust and universally applicable solutions for multi-class diagnosis.

AB  - Cerebral stroke is a major global health issue, contributing to high mortality and long-term disability. Early identification of individuals at high risk of stroke can significantly improve preventive care outcomes. We present a web-based stroke risk assessment tool that uniquely combines an accessible user interface with robust machine learning modeling. The proposed platform leverages a novel combination of SMOTE oversampling and logistic regression to address class imbalance in patient health records, improving the detection of stroke risk factors over existing methods. We compare a range of algorithms-including traditional classifiers and deep learning models-and report comprehensive performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC) for each. Our best model (logistic regression with SMOTE and standard scaling) achieves 93.2% accuracy with a substantially higher F1-score for the stroke-positive class than other models, indicating improved sensitivity to stroke cases. To bridge the gap between complex predictive models and end-users, we deploy this model in an intuitive web interface (built with Streamlit) that non-technical individuals and healthcare providers can easily use. This interface requires no specialized knowledge, preserves user privacy by avoiding any data storage, and provides clear explanations of results. By offering a practical and transparent tool for stroke risk screening, our work advances health informatics with an emphasis on accessibility, interpretability, and early intervention. Potential applications range from personal health self-assessment to integration in clinical workflows for preventive care, ultimately aiming to improve public health outcomes through early detection and intervention in stroke.

AB  - Hardware Trojans are malicious modifications in digital designs that can be inserted by untrusted supply chain entities. Hardware Trojans can give rise to diverse attack vectors such as information leakage (e.g. MOLES Trojan) and denial-of-service (rarely triggered bit flip). Such an attack in critical systems (e.g. healthcare and aviation) can endanger human lives and lead to catastrophic financial loss. Several techniques have been developed to detect such malicious modifications in digital designs, particularly for designs sourced from third-party intellectual property (IP) vendors. However, most techniques have scalability concerns (due to unsound assumptions during evaluation) and lead to large number of false positive detections (false alerts). Our framework (SALTY) mitigates these concerns through the use of a novel Graph Neural Network architecture (using Jumping-Knowledge mechanism) for generating initial predictions and an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) approach for fine tuning the outcomes (post-processing). Experiments show > 98% True Positive Rate (TPR) and True Negative Rate (TNR), significantly outperforming state-of-the-art techniques across a large set of standard benchmarks.

AB  - an important worldwide health problem is pneumonia, which mostly affects vulnerable groups including the elderly and small children. Reducing death rates and improving patient outcomes depend on an accurate and prompt diagnosis of pneumonia. Conventional diagnostic techniques such as radiologists interpreting chest X-rays (CXR), might be subjectively interpreted incorrectly and take a lot of time. In this study, we look into the automatic classification of cases Pneumonia from Chest X-rays (CXR) images, employing deep learning algorithms specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). A proposed research used a database of 5,216 chest x-ray images, with the number of samples classified as pneumonia being 3,875 and classified as normal 1,341. To serve as a benchmark, a more basic Support Vector Machine model (SVM) was utilized to compare the results of CNN model. The CNN model outperformed the SVM model, which obtained 97.03% accuracy, with a greater accuracy of 97.42% after training. The improved performance of CNN in identifying pneumonia was facilitated by its automated extraction of hierarchical characteristics from pictures. This study offers healthcare practitioners a useful tool by showcasing the ability of deep learning models to increase diagnostic speed and accuracy. The model's handling of multi-class classification, better generalization across a variety of datasets, and system integration into clinical settings for real-time diagnostic help will be the main areas of future effort.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus, often known as diabetes, is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. It can often go unnoticed for years due to several factors including irregular screening, unnoticeable symptoms, etc. In fact, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), of the 30.3 million Americans with diabetes, 7.2 million remain undiagnosed. However, undiagnosed diabetes can affect crucial cells and organs and complications include kidney damage, eye damage, increased risk of heart disease, etc. This research aims to see if we can address the challenge of prediabetes and diabetes detection using machine learning models. Multiple public diabetes datasets were obtained and preprocessed, involving statistical analyses, removing outliers/anomalies, and data resampling to enhance model training. Various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, KNNeighbors, and ExtraTrees, were employed for training. The accuracies varied across models, with Extra Trees exhibiting the highest at 99.0%. Using the insights from the most accurate model, Extra Trees, factors such as “Sex”, “CholCheck”, and “NoDocBcCheck” were most correlated to having diabetes. This study's findings are compared in detail with recent advances in machine learning for diabetes detection, highlighting similarities and differences in datasets, models, and results. Ethical considerations and model interpretability were examined using SHAP analysis to ensure fairness and transparency. The results underscore the significance of ML in proactive diabetes screening and intervention.

AB  - Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals serve as a critical non-invasive diagnostic tool, providing valuable insights into the electrical activity of the heart and are widely used in diagnosing arrhythmias—abnormal heart rhythms that can lead to severe cardiovascular complications or even fatality if left undiagnosed. However, detecting arrhythmias manually from ECG data is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process, which limits scalability in real-time, resource-constrained environments and often requires trained professionals. In this paper, we propose a robust multimodal deep learning (DL) model for classification of five heartbeat arrhythmia classes defined by the AAMI EC57 standard from ECG signals. Our model leverages temporal, spectral and morphological features extracted from ECG signals using QRS complexes, Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), and Markov Transition Field (MTF) to improve generalization and diagnostic accuracy. Evaluated on the widely used MITBIH Arrhythmia Database, our model achieves a classification accuracy of 98.4%, demonstrating performance on par with or exceeding several recent state-of-the-art approaches. Additionally, an interpretability model is incorporated to explain the classification outcomes using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values, highlighting the key features contributing to each prediction. The proposed system offers a promising solution for intelligent ECG analysis and real-time arrhythmia screening in clinical and wearable healthcare applications.

AB  - Landmark detection using chest X-ray images is often a time-consuming task performed by radiologists, followed by the calculation of cardiometric indices and the diagnosis of heart diseases. The goal of this research is to estimate uncertainty in data and knowledge, which leads to increased accuracy and interpretability in models that predict landmark positions and classify human body states. To achieve this, data from about 800 X-ray images labeled by four practicing radiologists was utilized. An uncertainty-aware negative log-likelihood loss was proposed to address both regression and classification problems. The proposed models were trained to predict the mean and log variance of a normal distribution for each input image, with the variance value estimating the uncertainty of the prediction. Natural data uncertainty was also measured from labels provided by different radiologists and implemented in the form of a label transform for the coordinates of the landmarks. The classification models demonstrated good correspondence with methods such as Monte Carlo dropout and deep ensembling, which account for knowledge uncertainty. The proposed uncertainty-aware models achieved the best results in both landmark detection and heart disease diagnosis, with accuracy improvements of 3% and 4.61%, respectively. The proposed methods are effective and easy to use, making their application to other medical problems a subject of interest for further research.

AB  - This Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major public health concern that often leads to mortality or long-term disability. Accurate prediction of outcomes, such as mortality and Functional Status Scale (FSS) scores, improves treatment strategies and guides clinical decisions. This study applies supervised machine learning (ML) techniques to predict mortality and FSS score in a real-world dataset of 300 pediatric TBI patients compiled by the University of Colorado School of Medicine. The dataset includes detailed clinical information, such as demographics, injury mechanisms, and hospitalization outcomes. Eighteen ML models predict mortality, while thirteen models forecast FSS scores. Performance metrics, including accuracy, ROC AUC, F1-score, and mean squared error, evaluate the models. Logistic regression and Extra Trees show high precision in mortality prediction, while linear regression achieves the best FSS score prediction with an R2 score of 0.62. Feature selection reduces 103 clinical variables to the most relevant ones, improving model efficiency and interpretability. The study highlights how ML models help clinicians identify high-risk cases and support personalized interventions. This research demonstrates the potential of ML-driven predictive analytics to integrate into clinical workflows, providing healthcare professionals with data-driven tools to improve TBI care.

AB  - For AI-based healthcare systems to be more interpretable and accurate, clinical decision-making complexity is increasingly escalating and hence becomes a significant research issue to examine. The hybrid fuzzy neural network that combines fuzzy logic, for clinical uncertainty management, with deep learning, for noise-resilient pattern discovery. Adaptive patient profiling is derived from a self-adjusting fuzzy-clustering algorithm, and contrastive self-supervised learning learns features from incomplete medical records; then a rule-augmented fuzzy inference layer outputs explainable reasoning. Executed through Edge-AI and federated learning, the model outputs real-time predictions without infringing on patient privacy. Measured on the Comprehensive Disease Symptom and Patient Profile Dataset, the HFNN achieves 94.6 % accuracy and 0.97 AUC–ROC, beating state-of-the-art deep nets and single-expert systems. In combining accuracy, adaptability, and explainability, the paradigm brings healthcare closer to reliable, time-series-ready clinical decision support. Traditional deep learning models achieve high diagnostic performance but operate as black boxes, hindering trust in medical applications.

AB  - Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive neurological disorder that impairs the body’s nervous system pathways. This disruption results in multiple complications related to movement and control, manifesting as symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, and impaired coordination. In the initial phases of PD, individuals have trouble with speech and exhibit a slow rate of verbal expression. Dysphonia is seventy to ninety percent of persons with Parkinson’s disease report a speech impairment or modification in speech, and it serves as a preliminary indicator of the disease. Consequently, speech can be a crucial modality in the initial phase of Parkinson’s disease prediction. In literature, diverse Machine Learning models are employed for Parkinson’s disease diagnosis utilizing voice analysis. Challenges such as class imbalance, feature selection, and interpretable predictive analysis still need to be addressed. Furthermore, the precision and reliability of the predictive outcomes are crucial to enhance healthcare services. Consequently, we propose an Explainable balanced Recursive Feature Importance with Logistic Regression (XRFILR) model to address the abovementioned issues. The proposed model extracts the pertinent features using an RFE with a Logistic Regression classifier and evaluates the feature significance in Parkinson’s disease prediction using eXplainable Artificial Intelligence. We employed the seven machine learning classifiers the model offers to diagnose Parkinson’s disease using significant speech data. Among these ML models, the proposed model achieved an accuracy of 96.46%, surpassing existing machine learning techniques.

AB  - Endocrine disorder thyroid disease affects many patients who need precise and prompt diagnostic methods for suitable treatment strategies. This research investigates machine learning model predictability for diagnosing thyroid disease using medical data collected from patients. The pre-processed dataset incorporated patient demographics alongside hormonal levels TSH T3 and T4 as well as lifestyle elements and medical documentation after performing data cleaning operation and encoding alongside feature scaling processes followed by exploratory data analysis. The evaluation of machine learning models used accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics to test Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest and CatBoost. Research results showed that Random Forest together with CatBoost obtained 97.30% accuracy whereas baseline models including Logistic Regression reached only 91.89% accuracy and Decision Tree reached only 94.59 % accuracy. The accuracy of CatBoost received a 1.41% boost through hyperparameter tuning which increased its generalisability capabilities. The error analysis showed that Logistic Regression performed poorly with non-ideal patterns because it produced excessive wrong negative predictions, yet Decision Trees demonstrated issues when dealing with marginally correct inputs. The Random Forest and CatBoost algorithms surpassed other models because they perfectly identified multiple feature relationships. The research shows that ensemble learning methods demonstrate potential to strengthen thyroid disease diagnosis by cutting down misdiagnosis rates while boosting clinical decision support. This research emphasizes that healthcare organizations should establish AI predictive modelling approaches for early healthcare identification alongside personalized treatment protocols which lead to better thyroid disorder diagnosis accuracy.

AB  - Cyberattacks on cloud computing have increased dramatically in recent years due to the technology's central role in today's digital infrastructure. The scattered and ever-changing nature of cloud systems makes it difficult for traditional security measures to identify and counteract sophisticated attackers. With an emphasis on their capacity to identify, avert, and react to cyber dangers in real-time, this study investigates the use of AI and ML technologies to improve cloud security. By analyzing massive databases for trends, predicting harmful actions, and mitigating assaults before they do harm, AI-powered solutions provide an adaptable, automated method to cloud security. Cloud security features including intrusion detection, anomaly detection, and threat intelligence are among those studied in this research, along with supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning machine learning models. Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered systems may swiftly and accurately identify sophisticated multi-vector cyberattacks, zero-day attacks, insider threats, and other forms of cybercrime by examining network traffic, user behavior, and system vulnerabilities. Data privacy, scalability, and the possibility of adversarial assaults on AI models are some of the issues that this study resolves as they pertain to cloud AI integration. The practical benefits of cloud security solutions powered by AI are demonstrated through case studies from areas like e-commerce, healthcare, and finance.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized many fields, including healthcare. The adoption of AI techniques in critical healthcare tasks, such as cancer diagnosis, holds great promise for revolutionizing the healthcare system. AI algorithms can be trained on vast datasets to recognize patterns, detect anomalies, and provide accurate assessments. However, the lack of realistic and up-to-date medical data poses a significant challenge to the widespread adoption of AI techniques. Additionally, privacy concerns surrounding sensitive medical data, particularly Patient Health Records (PHR), hinder data sharing among healthcare practitioners. This paper aims to address these challenges by proposing a novel framework, entitled SecureMed, that uses Federated Learning (FL) and Blockchain to preserve privacy in the healthcare system. In particular, SecureMed consists of (1) A novel distributed architecture that enables secure collaboration among multiple Mobile Edge Computing (MEC)-based Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices, while ensuring the privacy of healthcare systems; (2) A fairness-aware Federated Learning (FL) solution to ensure that model performance is balanced across all participating healthcare institutions, addressing the issue of imbalanced data contributions; (3) A Secure Multiparty Computation (SMPC) protocol to ensure secure aggregation of local model updates; and (4) A blockchain-based reputation model for collaborative FL training. The proposed framework leverages smart contracts to ensure trustworthiness, decentralization, and transparency in the FL process. The experimental results using the CIC IoMT dataset 2024 highlight the promising potential of SecureMed in revolutionizing healthcare systems.

AB  - Epileptic seizures are unpredictable neurological events of temporary disabilities in movement, behavior, sensation, and consciousness produced by abnormal and excessive electrical activities in the brain. Accurately anticipating epileptic seizures in their early phases is crucial for treatment initiation and patient safety. Traditional seizure prediction models struggle with high-dimensional EEG data, leading to suboptimal accuracy and inefficiency of processing. Current approaches are not easily deployable, which makes them inaccessible for practical settings. The Random Forest Classifier (RFC)-based Epileptic Seizure Prediction Model presented in this research is incorporated into a web application for user-friendly disease diagnosis. The model reduces dimensionality and maintains important EEG signal patterns using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to select features. The Random Forest classifier improves interpretability and robustness while surpassing traditional models in generalization and processing efficiency. Patients can enter EEG data values through the web interface and receive real-time seizure likelihood estimates. This method increases the precision of predictions and generates a user-friendly platform for proactive seizure control. The evaluation demonstrated high precision and recall in detecting the seizure patterns on the benchmark EEG datasets.

AB  - In order to assess the State of Charge (SOC) and State of Health (SOH) of batteries, this study proposes a hybrid machine learning model that combines Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with self-attention mechanisms. Self-attention processes enhance the model's ability to identify and concentrate on significant aspects of the input data through the use of dynamic significance weights. This enables the model to make use of intricate linkages and long-range dependencies, which are crucial for deciphering SOC and SOH patterns. DNNs' hierarchical feature extraction capabilities enhance the selfattention process. DNNs improve the forecast accuracy of SOC and SOH values by transforming high-dimensional input information into complicated non-linear correlations through their layer-wise structure. Supervised learning methods are used to train the hybrid model. The difference between expected and actual SOC and SOH values is measured by task-specific loss functions, such as mean squared error (MSE). Early stopping strategies keep an eye on validation performance to avoid overfitting, and the Adam optimizer is used for adaptive learning rate training and effective training. To get performance, model parameters including learning rates, dropout rates, and the number of attention heads are adjusted. Scatter plots, which display the distribution and accuracy of forecasts among various data points, are used to visualize SOC and SOH predictions. The scatter plots demonstrate the model's precision and dependability in identifying significant patterns and connections. The model's performance is verified by performance metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE). The suggested hybrid model's increased accuracy and stability are confirmed by baseline model comparison study. Because researchers can evaluate how SOC and SOH predicted values compare to actual values, scatter plot display further improves interpretability. In addition to predicting battery health, the modular architecture can analyze various datasets and applications. TensorFlow and PyTorch, two Python-based platforms, are used to implement this hybrid strategy. Utilizing high-end processing hardware such as GPUs and TPUs allows computation and scalability, while packages such as Hugging Face Transformers facilitate the speed at which self-attention mechanisms can be constructed. This hybrid approach's versatility makes it applicable to real-world systems, particularly those where precise and intelligible forecasts are essential, such energy storage, electric vehicle battery control, and industrial control. An effective and scalable way to comprehend battery health is to combine self-attention mechanisms with DNNs for SOC and SOH prediction. High predicted accuracy and dependability are achieved by the hybrid model's usage of feature prioritization and hierarchical learning. The usefulness of this technique is further demonstrated by the use of scatter plots to visualize predictions, which can offer helpful insights to battery monitoring and control systems. This study opens the door for future advancements in artificial intelligence applications to energy systems and beyond by confirming that machine learning algorithms may be used to carry out intricate forecasting tasks.

AB  - Addressing the global epidemic of obesity requires innovative approaches that enhance predictive accuracy and provide actionable insights. This study introduces a groundbreaking application of machine learning (ML) algorithms, enriched with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), to predict obesity with unprecedented precision. By deploying a comprehensive suite of algorithms—CatBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest, Bagging, and a novel Stacking Hybrid model—this research systematically quantifies and compares their predictive performances on a multifaceted dataset representing diverse demographic attributes. The incorporation of SHAP values into these algorithms marks a significant novelty, facilitating a nuanced understanding of the factors influencing obesity predictions. This approach not only enhances model transparency but also contributes to the robustness of obesity prediction by revealing the impact of each feature on the model’s output.

AB  - Automated segmentation of gastrointestinal polyps is a critical step in the early detection and prevention of colorectal cancer (CRC), which is one of the most common causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. This article presents a U-Net-based model enhanced with Attention Mechanisms and Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) for accurate polyp segmentation. To address the challenges of varying polyp sizes, indistinct boundaries, and complex textures, the model used a combined loss function (Binary Cross-Entropy and Dice Loss). Additionally, Gradient-Weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was integrated to provide visual explanations of the model’s decisions to increase trust and interpretability by clinical practitioners. The presented model was evaluated on five benchmark datasets, achieving a Dice Coefficient of 0.8378 and a Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.8427. The comparative analysis highlighted its superiority when compared to state-of-the-art contemporary approaches, with a precision and accuracy of 97%. Qualitative analyses also underline the ability to accurately delineate polyps, even in difficult situations. Although the model exhibited satisfactory performance, it still faced challenges regarding boundary misclassification and reduced efficacy in datasets with high variability. The next steps of this research will focus on domain adaptation and integration of additional modalities to enhance generalizability. This study provides a step toward automated polyp detection and demonstrates the potential of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to change the accuracy of diagnosis and healthcare for patients.

AB  - To avoid complications and readmissions to the hospital, diabetes is a chronic condition that needs to be continuously monitored and managed. In order to lower readmission rates, proactive interventions are made possible by machine learning (ML)-based predictive models, which have become effective tools for early identification of high-risk patients. In this study, deep learning techniques including recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used to investigate neural network-based models for diabetic patient readmission analysis. These models use past patient data to examine important characteristics such as blood sugar levels, medication compliance, comorbidities, and previous hospital stays in order to find trends linked to readmission chances. Methods for feature selection and data preprocessing, such as normalization and principal component analysis (PCA), improve model accuracy. Furthermore, optimization techniques like adaptive learning rates and dropout layers, as well as hyperparameter tuning, enhance performance even more. In readmission prediction, the suggested approach achieves greater precision and recall than conventional machine learning techniques like logistic regression and decision trees. By ensuring interpretability through the use of explainable AI tools, healthcare professionals may make data-driven judgments. The importance of ML-based methods in the management of diabetic patients is demonstrated by this study, opening the door to more individualized treatment regimens and better medical results.

AB  - Knowing the basis of decisions is essential for using Machine Learning (ML) in various regions, such as medical diagnosis, finance, and organizational decision-making. The Local Interpretable Model agnostic Explanation (LIME) algorithm is an Explainable AI (XAI) method that can be applied to many black -box models. However, there is a problem in that the local fidelity of the interpretable model decreases. Therefore, local fidelity must be increased, and the more interpretability of the local surrogate model, the better. Moreover, the fewer the changes, the easier it is to apply them to other studies and the more significant the contribution to the XAI area. Therefore, there are studies that improve fidelity by changing only the sampling. However, no studies have been identified that improve local fidelity and interpretability by modifying only the sampling. To this end, we use a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) to modify the sampling of LIME in the classification task to improve local fidelity and interpretability. We conducted a study to improve local fidelity and interpretability by modifying only the sampling part and clarifying the mechanism behind this improvement. Results show that the proposed method improves local fidelity while increasing interpretability compared to existing methods and the factors contributing to this improvement. We also conducted experiments on stability, stability against noise, and execution time, and confirmed that the proposed method performs well, although not as well as methods specific to these issues.

AB  - Heart failure (HF) poses critical global health challenges, emphasizing the need for robust predictive models to support early diagnosis and enhance patient outcomes. Traditional machine learning (ML) models, such as Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests (RF), Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), and Extreme Gradient Boosting Machines (xGBM), have shown effectiveness but face limitations in handling nonlinear relationships, addressing class imbalances, and generalizing across datasets. Deep learning (DL) models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), excel at identifying complex patterns but are hindered by computational requirements and limited interpretability, restricting clinical adoption. This research evaluates predictive models using nine datasets ranging from 299 to 400,000 records. Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied to address class imbalances, while a Stacking Generative AI (GenAI) model was developed. This hybrid model integrates Generative AI with RF, GBM, and CNNs, enhancing underrepresented subgroup representation through synthetic data generation. The Stacking Generative AI model demonstrated superior performance, achieving 98% accuracy and a Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve (ROC AUC) of 0.999 on a 1,025-record dataset. These results highlight the model's ability to handle complex data, enhance predictive accuracy, and improve clinical relevance. A web application further illustrates its practical value, offering an accessible platform for HF risk assessment. This study underscores the innovative role of hybrid models in advancing healthcare decision-making and improving patient care.

AB  - One major health concern for displaced people, such as Syrian refugees living in Jordan's AI-Zatari camp, is obesity. In this work, we developed an accurate and dependable obesity classification system by applying an XGBoost model to a dataset gathered from camp residents. The model's outstanding success - an accurate prediction of 98% was achieved - was a result of its adept handling of unbalanced data and complex, non-linear interactions. In order to address the particular health problems that this susceptible group, these findings are very important. Accurate obesity classification can help to influence the formulation of targeted healthcare programs, optimize resource allocation, and enable focused interventions that are customized to the requirements of refugees. This study highlights XGBoost's potential as a useful tool for monitoring and treating obesity in refugee settings, hence contributing to better health outcomes. Further research and widespread implementation of such data-driven approaches can help to develop evidence-based strategies to improve the overall well-being of displaced people dealing with obesity and its accompanying health consequences.

AB  - Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven substantial progress in conversational AI, yet their extensive parameterization and broad domain training often lead to “data hallucinations” and limited contextual accuracy. These become challenging especially in geographies like India's healthcare sector, where the interaction of numerous languages, distinctive regional practices, and different culture, localized expertise dominant. This paper presents a metaclustering framework that combines Distilled Language Models (DLMs) and Small/Specialized Language Models (SLMs) with meta-learning techniques and introduces a novel Multi-State Model (MSM) approach. The MSM component formalizes the evolution of individual models from a standalone state to integration within a dynamically configured cluster. Through state transition equations, the framework captures, stores, processes, and retrieves localized information with enhanced trustworthiness. Each model's state, $s(t)$, is updated via a meta-learning function incorporating local input signals and global supervisory prompts. The evolution of the holistic system is modeled by state transition matrix, enabling better resource allocation and reducing model-induced hallucinations. Distributed meta-learning strategies, like G-Meta, continuously adjust parameters across geographically distributed GPU nodes. Integrating localized specialization with global consistency, the proposed approach bargains scalable solution for healthcare applications. This integrated approach, supported by MedHalu and Med-HALT, demonstrates improvements in interpretability and operational efficiency.

AB  - The Erasmus+ Ethical Engineer project aims to enhance AI education by integrating ethical, social, and legal aspects into engineering training, promoting truthful AI in Europe. In the paper, we present the explored case studies and the methodology for their development. AI ethics is explored through the following case studies. AI in healthcare is examined through fall detection systems for vulnerable populations, the potential for data bias in personalized medical devices, and the ethical implications of off-label device use, such as continuous artificial hearts. The use of AI in witness testimonies is considered through the example of the AIWitness chatbot designed to automate witness statements. Ethical considerations surrounding facial recognition are explored in the context of airport boarding, using a hypothetical scenario based on Brighton International Airport's pilot program, FaceBoard. The project also considers self-driving taxis' ethical and practical implications, using a hypothetical scenario in San Francisco. The ecological impact of generative AI is analyzed, referencing studies from Stanford University on energy consumption and water usage for cooling systems. The ethical challenges of AI in marketing processes are addressed, including the generation of content like text, images, and voice, along with concerns about job displacement, fake content creation, and authorship issues. The use of AI in assessing historic photos is examined, focusing on selection bias, the potential for surfacing insulting content, the need for transparency, and the potential prioritization of profit over ethical considerations. Finally, the paper addresses the pervasive issue of bias in data, particularly within the field of data science. The main contribution of the paper is the development of a structured template for creating AI ethics case studies, which we already tested with smaller groups of teachers and students and refined based on their feedback.

AB  - Diabetes is a global disease which is characterized by high levels of blood glucose, due to the inability of the body to produce insulin or the insufficient use of the insulin produced. Diabetes requires periodic check-ups, medicines, constant watch and follow ups. The idea of early flagging is crucial for effective distribution of patients within the healthcare organization. In the present analysis, a dataset containing data on inpatient encounters from 130 US hospitals is used for the purpose of readmissions prediction of diabetic patients. The research focuses on two distinct prediction scenarios, firstly ’Necessity Case Readmission’ for the better conditioning of the hospital resource management; and follwed by ’Criticality Case Readmission’ for the identification of patients with severe complications as early as possible. To increase the model performance, several data balancing methods were utilized and provided a balance between the classes. Filter techniques were employed to select the most important variables for prediction purposes. Machine learning models were assessed and the Optuna hyperparameters were applied to the best performing models. The proposed approach yielded a recall rate of 0.80, a F1-score of 0.78, and 80% accuracy. These predictions aim at effectively helping the hospital management provide better patient care with efficiency in the use of the scarce resources. The research paper suggests that both necessity and criticality predictions can be useful in developing a proactive strategy for the healthcare industry.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence has unprecedented role in oncology due to which the diagnostic, patient-individualized treatment and predictive analysis aspects have been hit by a breath of fresh perspectives in this field. This survey is being made considering the basic issues and answers already suggested by AI in oncology. There exists a plethora of AI-based learning methods including deep and machine learning, and also hybrid models that have been used on various fronts of cancer care such as detection, prognosis, and drug discovery. The current article points to the positive aspects of AI and it discusses the benefits of AI technology as to the impression that it allows for an accurate prescription, individualized therapy and dealing with big datasets. However, difficulties like interpretability, privacy, and model integration into clinical workflows will continue to be major obstacles. Besides, AI Gone Wild is the dark side of inductive AI. This dilemma identifies the exigency of AI needing quality data and the difficulty of inflecting AI tools into existing healthcare infrastructures as the limitations of the current AI technology. In this context, some future perspectives are put forward; for instance, such include AI luminous radiomics, clinical decision-making with the aid of natural language processing, and the fusion of multi-omics data. This study compares AI models, namely CNNs, Transformers, and ensemble models, to classify and treat cancer. It alleviates shortcomings of dataset biases, ethical concerns, and model explain-ability and it covers a guidance list to initiate the research and development of AI in oncology.

AB  - Worldwide, millions of senior citizens are suffering from Alzheimer disease abbreviated as AD, a well- versed form of dementia. AD is featured by amnesia, intellectual disability, and difficulty with consciousness. DL and ML models are undoubtedly explored to identify AD related patterns on large dimensional neuroimaging data but they need global optimization and are suffering from overfitting issue that might yield dissatisfactory result in testing data set. DL overcomes the issue by convolution of input image with kernel but any sudden change in the MRI image or human manipulation, limited pre- processing of the images can mislead CNN in achieving highly accurate detection. Transfer Learning (TL) has proved itself in AD diagnosis by utilizing pre-trained models on large data sets to guide novice model in a new neuroimaging dataset. This review provides an inclusive glimpse of TL implication in classification, identification including the conversion of AD. Keeping in view, we have assessed the strengths and limitations of TL in improvising diagnostic accuracy even with limited data. The uniqueness of the present review is the incorporation of explainable AI in TL based AD diagnosis system. Finally, it can be claimed that the review will guide the new re-searchers in the area of TL induced neurodegenerative disease detection.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases continue to be among the top causes of death globally, therefore stressing the importance of early and correct detection. Conventional models for predicting heart disease tend to be based on IoT monitoring systems, with limitations like high expense, network reliance, and delay in real-time processing. To overcome these shortcomings, this paper introduces a Machine Learning (ML) approach that does away with IoT reliance while improving prediction performance. The system recommended combining sophisticated data preprocessing and feature selection methods to deliver interpretable predictions. Real-time alerts also facilitate early intervention for patients at risk. Comparative evaluation against current models illustrates enhanced accuracy based on precision, recall, and general predictability, which makes the strategy a cost-saving and effective option for early heart disease diagnosis.

AB  - Opioid use disorder (OUD) presents a pressing global public health challenge, with Medication for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD) serving as an effective treatment. However, the success of MOUD is largely dependent on patient adherence, as premature dropout increases the risks of relapse and worsens health outcomes. Motivated by large variations in treatment outcomes across different states in U.S., this study proposes a novel, explainable machine learning (ML) framework to predict premature dropout from MOUD, enabling state-specific customization through multi-task learning. The proposed multi-task learning model integrates shared layers to capture general dropout patterns and state-specific layers to highlight regional differences. To enhance interpretability, we employ Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to identify key predictive features for each state and use Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) to offer individualized insights into adherence factors. Evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate superior performance compared to baseline models, validating the framework’s ability to address both general and state-specific factors. This work underscores the need for targeted interventions and policies to improve MOUD retention and tackle the opioid crisis across diverse states.CCS Concepts• Applied computing → Health care information systems.

AB  - Pneumonia is a lung infection, that causes breathing difficulties and significant risks to young children, older persons, and individuals with weak immune systems. Diagnosing pneumonia typically involves examining chest X-rays to identify abnormal white patches over the lung area that indicate infection. This study addresses the diagnosis of pneumonia using artificial intelligence techniques, thereby reducing the need for extensive human intervention and saving time in pneumonia diagnosis. To achieve this, we developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model with skip connection blocks. These skip connections help the model retain critical information and accelerate convergence thus eliminating the vanishing gradient problem. The model was trained on 5,863 chest radiograph images, achieving outstanding accuracy, precision, and recall scores of 96.76%, 97.56%, and 98.01%, respectively. This high performance ensures accurate pneumonia identification, in the areas where precise diagnosis is crucial, such as in healthcare facilities. The study's findings emphasize the effectiveness of residual blocks in improving CNN performance for medical image analysis. To emphasise the effectiveness of our model we have also implemented comparative study with other established models including InceptionV3, ResNet50 and VGG-16. Proposed model demonstrated superiority in convergence time and model parameter efficiency. By reducing training iterations, our model expedites the diagnostic process and underscores the potential of AI in rapid medical diagnostics. This pioneering research establishes a strong foundation for future studies aimed at leveraging AI in diagnosing a variety of medical conditions using X-ray imaging. It has the potential to revolutionize medical diagnostics through advanced computational techniques.

AB  - Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) remains a critical health issue on a global scale, often progressing undiagnosed until advanced stages. In this research, a machine learning (ML)-based predictive system was developed to assess CKD risk with a Logistic Regression (LR) model. A dataset containing relevant medical attributes, such as blood urea levels, blood glucose readings, and indicators of conditions like anemia and diabetes, was utilized. Data preprocessing techniques, including cleaning, encoding, and feature selection, were applied to enhance model performance. The trained model achieved an accuracy of 97.5%, with precision and recall values exceeding 95%, ensuring high reliability in CKD prediction. A web-based application was integrated with the model using the Flask framework, allowing users to input medical test values and receive instant risk assessments. Comparative analysis with other ML algorithms revealed that Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting (GB) exhibited slightly higher accuracy, but LR remained a competitive choice due to its simplicity and interpretability. The confusion matrix analysis indicated minimal misclassifications, confirming the model's effectiveness in real-world applications. By providing an accessible and user-friendly interface, early recognition and timely medical intervention were facilitated. The research demonstrated that ML significantly enhances disease prediction and proactive healthcare management. However, limitations such as dataset size and demographic diversity were identified, suggesting the need for further research. The findings emphasized that ML, when combined with web technologies, offers an efficient approach to CKD risk assessment, contributing to the advancement of predictive healthcare solutions.

AB  - Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive form of dementia that deteriorates memory, cognition, and behavior, eventually impairing daily activities and causing brain damage, making it a significant global health concern. Conventional diagnostic techniques, such as manual brain image evaluations and cognitive assessments, often require significant time, prone to errors, and reliant on expert availability, underscoring the need for an automated, efficient, and transparent detection method. While substantial research has been conducted using brain MRI images and CNNs, challenges remain in achieving high performance and transparency on complex multiclass datasets with overlapping features. This study introduces a hybrid method that combines CNN for feature extraction, Multi-Head Attention to capture temporal dependencies, and BiGRU for sequential classification of Alzheimer’s stages. Grad-CAM and t-SNE visualizations enhance explainability, offering valuable insights into stage detection and improving model transparency. Using the OASIS dataset, the proposed method effectively addresses challenges arising from feature overlap and class imbalance, achieving 95% accuracy, with precision, recall, and F1-scores of 94.79%, 94.82%, and 94.76%, respectively, outperforming existing methods on 2D MRI data. This hybrid approach presents an effective tool for precise multistage Alzheimer’s detection, localization, and monitoring, offering cost efficiency, fostering trust in AI-driven diagnostics, and streamlining autonomous healthcare solutions.

AB  - Because of the multi-symptomatic nature of sepsis, its prediction is challenging as it requires considering subtle changes in multiple monitored variables across time. Recent works based on deep neural networks improved the prediction performance, but still suffer from poor interpretability. Critical for healthcare applications, we propose to improve this aspect by separating time variables in the convolution layers of a sepsis prediction network. We reveal the improvement in interpretability capacity with the use of gradient-based attributions on high-level intermediate features and through a metric correlating the variable attribution with the prediction for perturbed pathologic samples. With 171,945 patients from the MIMIC-IV database, we demonstrate that our method not only maintains classification performances at similar network parameters count, but also substantially improves the faithfulness of pervariable attributions. This enhanced interpretability has the potential to improve clinical decision-making by enabling practitioners to swiftly identify critical variables, which could streamline patient monitoring workflows.

AB  - Integrating AI models with the medical domain is challenging as it involves more complex workflows compared to traditional machine learning operations (MLOps). Requirements such as model performance monitoring, calibration, and retraining on live medical data, as well as underdeveloped XAI and MLOps integration, have not yet been fully covered by existing works. This paper proposes the MLXOps4Medic, an initial machine learning and explainability operations (MLXOps) framework based on the microservices architecture for AI model development in the medical domain. The framework focuses on four types of tasks in the MLXOps: training, model evaluation, XAI explanation generation, and XAI evaluation. It can orchestrate tasks between different types of microservices, automatically transferring the necessary data and configurations for task execution to reduce operational overhead. Additionally, the framework collects the provenance of the workflow metadata and builds a provenance network, which facilitates workflow tracing and reproducibility throughout the complex MLXOps lifecycle. Three case studies illustrate the key findings concerning the framework: 1) a significant reduction in operational overhead by approximately 72.55% resulting from complex AI experiments; 2) facilitation of MLXOps customization for complex workflows such as data drift monitoring, integration of multimodal medical AI models, and reproduction of historical training data; and 3) provision for prediction and explanation generation for medical AI models through a web portal. Furthermore, the framework is compared with the well-established MLOps framework called MLflow on a general domain MLX pipeline execution, demonstrating observable efficiency in terms of zero-code configuration for the training task and utilizing 36.14% less time for training task execution. These key findings demonstrate that the MLXOps4Medic framework delivers an efficient and highly adaptable MLXOps solution for AI and medical integration. By addressing identified challenges in workflow orchestration, it serves as a foundational framework with far-reaching implications for future research and applications across diverse domains.

This paper examines predictive modeling techniques for diabetes classification and Type-3 Diabetes (T3DM) prediction using the NC State University Diabetes Dataset and the Ohio Longitudinal 2023 Dataset. By employing various machine learning approaches, data preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis, we achieve an 81.1% accuracy rate in diabetes classification through a hybrid method. This approach combines the predictive strengths of gradient boosting and logistic regression classifiers. Additionally, we develop a T3DM prediction model that effectively identifies individuals at risk, showcasing its strong predictive capabilities. The implementation of the hybrid algorithm highlights its superior performance compared to standalone models. Our results emphasize the importance of predictive modeling in improving diabetes management, aiding healthcare decision-making, and enhancing patient outcomes. Future research could explore incorporating additional data sources and advanced techniques to further improve the clinical relevance and predictive accuracy of diabetes care.

AB  - Emotion recognition plays a vital role in human-computer interaction, offering applications in healthcare, education, and entertainment. This research proposes a single modality paradigm for emotion detection leveraging EEG signals from the DREAMER dataset to predict the valence, arousal, and dominance. Unlike the other approaches that rely on using computationally expensive neural networks, we have utilized lightweight machine learning models and advanced feature engineering methods to achieve accuracies of 98.6%, 96.6%, and 95.7% respectively which are pretty close to the state of art model accuracies while having a relatively much lower inference time of just 9.78 milli seconds. Another highlight of our research is that we were able to determine which EEG channels and characteristics had the greatest influence on each emotional dimension, which further improves the interpretability of our research. Our approach highlights the possibility for scalable and explicable emotion identification systems utilizing EEG data alone by combining high accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability.
