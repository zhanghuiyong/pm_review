AB  - Pneumonia, a significant global health concern, necessitates accurate diagnostic tools to enable timely and effective intervention. This study applies Early Fusion techniques to enhance pneumonia detection in chest X-ray analysis by integrating feature extraction methods—Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), and Local Binary Pattern (LBP). The fused features were used to train multiple machine learning models, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Utilizing a dataset of 5,937 chest X-ray images, the SVM model achieved the highest accuracy (94.00%) and area under the curve (AUC) score (93.95%), demonstrating superior diagnostic performance compared to other models. The Early Fusion approach effectively captured complementary patterns in X-ray images, addressing challenges such as noise and subtle variability. These findings highlight the potential of fusion-based frameworks to improve diagnostic accuracy and reliability, supporting radiologists with automated tools for clinical decision-making. Future research will focus on validating the approach on larger, diverse datasets and improving the interpretability of fusion models while optimizing resource requirements to enable scalable deployment in real-world healthcare environments.

AB  - Currently, society has entered the era of "Internet +," where technology brings more convenience to people. Knowledge Graph (KG) is a structured information system of world knowledge and serves as the cornerstone for artificial intelligence reasoning and memory. In recent years, with the improvement of deep models and computing power, Knowledge Graph technology has rapidly developed, providing foundational support for applications such as question answering, recommendation systems, and search engines. Knowledge Based Question Answering (KBQA) utilizes knowledge bases (KB) to answer questions and finds wide application in fields like search, finance, and healthcare. Due to the gap in representation between unstructured natural language questions and structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs), answering questions on knowledge graphs presents certain challenges. Existing methods based on semantic parsing struggle to construct structured queries that can be executed on knowledge bases, thereby failing to cover various complex questions. Conversely, methods based on information retrieval exhibit poor interpretability. This paper proposes a novel approach driven by machine reading comprehension. To transform KG subgraphs centered around subject entities into text, this paper employs schema trees to depict the subgraphs, which facilitates retrieving multiple semantically equivalent answer entities. The KG2Text method is utilized to generate corresponding text from the constructed schema trees. In contrast to seeking answers from all automatically generated paragraphs, this paper employs a contrastive learning approach to filter out paragraphs that may contain answers. Finally, answers are obtained based on answer fragments detected by the machine reading comprehension module. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms existing methods.

AB  - Integrating both federated learning and blockchain technology proposed a writing solution to the inescapable challenges of data privacy, security, and trust in FL-based decentralized machine learning environments. This paper proposes a BEFL framework with a blockchain network to ensure the trustworthiness and accountability of federated learning. The results presented in the experimental evaluation, conducted on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and a healthcare dataset, demonstrate the superiority of BEFL over FL. The BEFL framework achieved 98.5% on MNIST, CIFAR-10 82.3%, and the healthcare dataset 87.6% while surpassing standard FL by 3% on average. Regarding the convergence speed, the proposed BEFL reached the target accuracy level in 40 communication cycles for MNIST and 100 rounds for CIFAR-10, while the standard FL was 60 and 140 rounds, respectively, which is approximately 30% faster. While BEFL has a higher communication cost (180 MB for MNIST and 300 MB for CIFAR- 10) than the standard FL (150 MB and 250 MB, respectively), the authors consider it a worthy tradeoff with benefits in terms of security and transparency. The above results under adversary scenarios showed that, as with FL, the proposed BEFL framework was more robust to data poisoning, with the accuracy drop to a mere 1.5% as opposed to 5.2% of FL and a model inversion attack reconstruction accuracy of only 20% as compared to 60% of FL. The above outcomes show that through BEFL, it is possible to support distributed learning while maintaining the security of the fields of study, such as health and finance, as illustrated above.

AB  - The criticality of COVID-19 has burdened our healthcare resources. Thus, there is a growing need to advance our healthcare frameworks. Recently, with the rise of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) models in healthcare that leverage interpretability and solve the black-box nature of AI, healthcare frameworks and designs in smart cities have improved many folds. To address the crisis in light of future COVID-19-like pandemics in smart cities, we propose a case-study,X-Pand, that utilizes an XAI framework over Random Forest (RF) algorithm for feature selection in COVID-19 detection. Unlike recent schemes that are mostly non-interpretable,X-Pandemphasizes transparency and interpretability, crucial for gaining actionable insights and trust in automated health diagnostics. We present a feature ranking mechanism, which integrates Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) for enhanced decision tree interpretability, optimizing feature selection and improving diagnostic accuracy. We evaluateX-Pandon a comprehensive COVID-19 clinical spectrum dataset, demonstrating superior performance in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity compared to traditional models like XGBoost, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Our findings reveal thatX-Pandnot only achieves higher prediction accuracy but also offers clearer justifications for its decisions, thus enabling more informed and confident clinical decisions.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a leading cause of death globally, with ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) being a major contributor to both death and cardiac complications. The 30-day post-STEMI period is critical to patient outcomes and necessitates accurate risk prediction to enable timely interventions and personalized treatment plans. Traditional statistical risk assessment tools, while widely used, are predominantly based on Caucasian population and do not address the specific risk profiles of other demographics, such as the Indian population. We propose CardioGraph, a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based cardiovascular risk predictor, designed specifically for Indian patients, to predict the 30-day mortality risk following STEMI. Results show that our proposed system outperforms in comparison to traditional Machine Learning based classifiers, such as Random Forest, Multi-Layer Perceptron, and Extreme Gradient Boosting, achieving a Macro F1 score of 93.5%. SHAP interpretability analysis of the proposed model identified some key predictors of 30-day mortality, such as mitral regurgitation, tobacco use, low ejection fraction, diabetes, and hypertension. Our proposed model effectively predicts 30-day mortality post-STEMI with high accuracy, which suggests a significant advancement in cardiovascular risk prediction.

AB  - Rehabilitation robots and human-robot interaction systems are receiving increasing attention in modern healthcare and engineering. Motion intent recognition techniques based on surface electromyography (sEMG) signals provide important support for these systems. However, motion intent recognition models rarely focus on the spatiotemporal properties of sEMG signals simultaneously. There is a lack of interpretable analysis of these spatiotemporal properties. The purpose of this study is to perform gesture recognition of sEMG signals from the Ninapro database using a temporal convolutional network (TCN). The sEMG signals are converted into sEMG images, which are used as input to the TCN model. The TCN model is utilized to perform gesture recognition on these images. The results show that after fusing the spatial and temporal features of the sEMG signal, the recognition accuracy of the TCN model is significantly higher than that of models using only spatial features or only temporal features. To understand the decision-making process of the model, we used an interpretable method based on Shapley values to perform a detailed interpretive analysis of the recognition results. The experimental results show that the TCN model has significant accuracy and stability in the sEMG signal gesture recognition task, while the Shapley value-based interpretable method can effectively reveal the contribution of different features to the prediction results, thus improving the transparency and user trust in the model. This study not only provides a new technical tool for sEMG signal gesture recognition but also demonstrates the value of interpretable methods in deep learning models.

AB  - Medication recommendation is a productive task for AI-driven healthcare systems, which can assist clinicians in prescribing judicious and effective treatments. However, existing medication recommendation methods omit two key pieces of information: Coarse-grained interaction information between distinct types of symptoms in a patient's medical history and corresponding medication representations can serve as attention for predicting the current medication combinations of the patient. Fine-grained interaction information between medication substructure representations and different types of symptoms can facilitate the construction of molecular-level disentangled medication representations. To address this dilemma, we propose a novel Dual Adaptive Interaction Network (DAI-Net), which encodes comprehensive interaction knowledge between patients' multifaceted health records and medication molecules to improve the performance of medication recommendation and heighten interpretability of the model. Specifically, we design a symptom-aware medication matching module to extract coordinated associations between patient symptoms and medication molecules, coarse-grained interaction learning. The medication embeddings are utilized to transform patient-medication matching properties into a symptom-substructure matching matrix for fine-grained interaction. The patient's Longitudinal representation is employed as a query to decode both symptom-medication and symptom-substructure matching information for coordinated medication representation. DAI-Net is an end-to-end recommendation model. Extensive experiments on the real-world EHR datasets, i.e., the public benchmark MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, and eICU, demonstrate that the proposed DAI-Net achieves competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art ones, with an average improvement of 1.8%, 2.1% in Jaccard on MIMIC-III and -IV dataset.

AB  - Effectively preventing and diagnosing laryngeal cancer is imperative for improving prognosis, particularly in high-risk populations. Early diagnosis in these individuals is crucial, offering timely interventions and higher survival rates. There is a growing demand for computer-assisted early prognosis with transparent and accountable interpretations. Methods and procedures: We present an interpretable classification framework based on radiomics for narrow-band imaging in contact endoscopy for laryngeal cancer. The framework aims to address the challenge of early prognosis with transparency and accountability by offering evidence-supported interpretation. Results: Performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, area under the curve (AUC), negative predict value (NPV), balanced accuracy(BA) and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were employed to analyze the results. The radiomics-based model demonstrated high recall rate (>94% in 3 out the 5 classifiers employed) and balanced accuracy (>89% in 3 classifiers) in distinguishing between benign and malignant cases. The interpretability analysis shed light on the framework’s behavior evidencing three features as main contributors for classification. Conclusion: Our interpretable classifying framework shows promise as a preliminary clinical diagnostic assistant for laryngeal cancer. Its commitment to transparency and accountability renders it an invaluable resource for conveying insightful information and assessing the framework’s effectiveness. Clinical impact: Our framework addresses the challenge of early diagnosis among high-risk populations, providing a transparent and accountable tool for clinicians and researchers.

AB  - Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a condition affecting the retina due to Diabetes Mellitus, a condition that may result in vision impairment if not promptly diagnosed and treated. Traditional manual detection methods by ophthalmologists are labor-intensive and require specialized expertise. To overcome in response to these constraints, we introduce a fresh methodology employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) based architecture for automated DR detection and severity classification from fundus pictures. We aim to optimize the detection procedure and improve accuracy, particularly in identifying subtle features indicative of retinal damage associated with DR. Our research emphasizes the urgency of identification and categorization at an early stage of DR severity levels, ranging from Normal to Proliferative, to facilitate timely intervention and prevent irreversible vision loss. We advocate for further research to refine accuracy in classification and explore additional indicators of retinal diseases, underscoring the importance of leveraging advanced technologies to address complex healthcare challenges. The system comprises pre-processing, model development, training, and classification components, each optimized to enhance performance and reliability. Moreover, RetinaGuard incorporates advanced interpretability techniques, allowing clinicians to visualize and understand the decision-making process of the model, thereby fostering trust and acceptance in clinical settings. By providing a detailed exploration of its components and functionalities, this paper contributes to the progress of medical image analysis. RetinaGuard presents a promising resolution for streamline and improve DR screening and management practices. With its capability to automate DR diagnosis accurately, RetinaGuard has the potential to significantly impact patient care by facilitating early intervention and treatment, ultimately reducing the burden of vision loss associated with DR.

AB  - Transfer learning has been a game-changer for natural language processing (NLP), and this technique has massively accelerated progress in the field of NLP, specifically by substantially benefiting from advancements being made elsewhere. We evaluated their performance economic model on a set of tasks and found they outperformed generic transformer models in accuracy as well as generalization. This is also a reminder of the importance of large-scale pretraining, which requires less task-specific data and consequently facilitates faster model development. To achieve a better understanding of the impact on model performance from fine-tuning, combined with datasets characteristics and architecture details. They demonstrated that transfer learning models not only increase classification accuracy in various fields, ranging from healthcare to legal document analysis but also vastly improve the efficiency. These results have important implications, they extend transfer learning from being merely a trend in NLP to something truly necessary for making progress on several fundamental task of NLP. However, work is not done on model interpretability and extending these improvements to low resource languages. This suggests future research in operationalizing these powerful tools transparently and fairly across a wide range of linguistic and cultural contexts. We hope that it can help, at least in some way, to grow the community interested on learning more about how these models work so effectively and guide them toward using transfer learning wherever valuable.

AB  - This paper presents a novel multimodal medical image fusion framework (M3IF-NSST-CNN) combining the Non-Subsampled Shearlet Transform (NSST) and deep convolutional neural network (CNN) methods to enhance diagnostic accuracy by effectively integrating Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Initially, both CT and MRI images undergo decomposition via NSST, producing distinct low-pass (LPSB) and high-pass subbands (HPSB). The LPSB fusion leverages a correlation-based approach, ensuring preservation of structural integrity and maximization of complementary information. Concurrently, the HPSB are merged through a Universal Image Quality Index (UIQI)-based fusion rule, prioritizing edge and detail retention critical for precise medical diagnosis. Subsequently, an inverse NSST transforms these fused sub-bands, generating a preliminary fused image. This image is then further refined through a CNN-based noise reduction module comprising convolutional layers, batch normalization, and Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation functions. The deep CNN architecture progressively refines the fused output, significantly reducing artifacts and noise, thus improving the overall clarity and interpretability of the resultant image. This approach addresses common limitations in image fusion, such as loss of edge details, distortion, and the inability to preserve critical information. The hybrid M3IF-NSST-CNN method improves both the visual quality and parametric accuracy of the fusion, outperforming comparable techniques. By preserving more detail and edge information, this method offers significant advancements in multi-modal medical image fusion for enhanced diagnostic insights.

AB  - Developing doctor recommendation techniques has the potential to enhance the efficiency of telemedicine service with the increasing demand for telemedicine. We propose a novel recommendation method tailored for more sparser and more professional telemedicine contexts than online healthcare. Firstly, we construct a knowledge graph based on the expertise of physicians to extract the feature of disease relevance, so as to make up for the sparsity of data. Subsequently, coarse and fine granularity semantic feature is extracted from historical diagnostic data to calculate text similarity between doctors and patients. Then, the features of gender, age, title and scheduling activity are considered to improve model performance doctor modeling. Finally, we input the extracted features into a neural network to generate recommendation results that are both effective and interpretable. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional methods, our approach significantly improves the accuracy and robustness of telemedicine doctor recommendations. Additionally, interpretability analysis shows text similarity and disease relevance (obtained from doctors' professional expertise and consultation text) contribute mostly to the recommendation system, which reconfirms our efforts are meaningful.

AB  - The integration of medicine and artificial intelligence is creating novel opportunities to gather, analyze, and generate groundbreaking medical insights from the vast expanse of medical literature. Although these advancements hold great promise, difficulties including manual annotation and precise data retrieval, and transparency persist. Advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques and large language models (LLMs) have shown potential in addressing these issues. This paper introduces the Medical Knowledge Graph (MedKG), a comprehensive and multidisciplinary medical knowledge graph. By utilizing advanced NLP algorithms, MedKG extracts millions of entities and converts them into triples from a corpus of superior medical research papers published over the last decade. It categorizes unstructured medical information into nine distinct tags, including disease names, treatments, diagnoses, symptoms, genetics, cellular structures of diseases, patient data, medical procedures, and treatment applications, while seamlessly integrating the digital object identifier (DOI) of each paper. As the latest structured database of medical knowledge, MedKG serves as a powerful tool for accelerating medical research and lays the groundwork for constructing a more extensive medical knowledge graph using full-text medical articles. Moreover, our research establishes a foundation for practical knowledge management systems based on text mining, applicable not only to complex medical systems but also to other professional domains.

AB  - Learning graph representations of brain networks aims to facilitate a deeper understanding of the brain’s functional organizational patterns by developing data-driven algorithms on graph structures, thereby advancing neuroscience. Recently, deep learning models for brain networks based on graph neural networks (GNN) have emerged and become predominant in several tasks of brain functional analysis. Despite the significant successes of graph representation learning in brain networks, there remains a gap in dynamically modeling brain networks as they change over time. Inspired by state space modeling (SSM) in large language models, particularly Mamba, we introduce brain graph Mamba (Brain-GM) for dynamic brain graph representation learning. Specifically, we first validated the brain decoding performance of the Brain-GM model on the HCP dataset. Subsequently, we achieved leading disease diagnostic outcomes on unimodal brain disease datasets (ABIDE and ADHD), and for multi-modal neuroimaging data, we further optimized classification performance through similarity network fusion (SNF). Brain-GM marks the first integration of the state space model into dynamic brain graph representation learning, where the model’s graph learning readout layer and state-space features also support interpretability, enhancing our understanding of brain mechanisms related to different task states or diseases. The experimental code has been open-sourced at https://github.com/tokamak-wang/brain-gm.

AB  - The widespread application of machine learning techniques to biomedical data has produced many new insights into disease progression and improving clinical care. Inspired by the flexibility and interpretability of graphs (networks), as well as the potency of sequence models like transformers and higher-order networks (HONs), we propose a method that identifies combinations of risk factors for a given outcome and accurately encodes these higher-order relationships in a graph. Using historical data from 913,475 type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients, we found that, compared to other approaches, the proposed networks encode significantly more information about the progression of T2D toward a variety of outcomes. We additionally demonstrate how structural information from the proposed graph can be used to augment the performance of transformer-based models on predictive tasks, especially when the data are noisy. By increasing the order, or memory, of the graph, we show how the proposed method illuminates key risk factors while successfully ignoring noisy elements, which facilitates analysis that is simultaneously accurate and interpretable.

AB  - Multivariate or multidimensional visualization plays an essential role in exploratory data analysis by allowing users to derive insights and formulate hypotheses. Despite their popularity, it is usually users’ responsibility to (visually) discover the data patterns, which can be cumbersome and time-consuming. Visual Analytics (VA) and machine learning techniques can be instrumental in mitigating this problem by automatically discovering and representing such patterns. One example is the integration of classification models with (visual) interpretability strategies, where models are used as surrogates for data patterns so that understanding a model enables understanding the phenomenon represented by the data. Although useful and inspiring, the few proposed solutions are based on visual representations of so-called black-box models, so the interpretation of the patterns captured by the models is not straightforward, requiring mechanisms to transform them into human-understandable pieces of information. This paper presents multiVariate dAta eXplanation (VAX), a new VA method to support identifying and visual interpreting patterns in multivariate datasets. Unlike the existing similar approaches, VAX uses the concept of Jumping Emerging Patterns, inherent interpretable logic statements representing class-variable relationships (patterns) derived from random Decision Trees. The potential of VAX is shown through use cases employing two real-world datasets covering different scenarios where intricate patterns are discovered and represented, something challenging to be done using usual exploratory approaches.

AB  - Ultrasound (US) imaging is widely used in diagnosing and staging abdominal diseases due to its lack of non-ionizing radiation and prevalent availability. However, significant inter-operator variability and inconsistent image acquisition hinder the widespread adoption of extensive screening programs. Robotic ultrasound systems have emerged as a promising solution, offering standardized acquisition protocols and the possibility of automated acquisition. Additionally, these systems enable access to 3D data via robotic tracking, enhancing volumetric reconstruction for improved ultrasound interpretation and precise disease diagnosis.However, the interpretability of 3D US reconstruction of abdominal images can be affected by the patient’s breathing motion. This study introduces a method to compensate for breathing motion in 3D US compounding by leveraging implicit neural representations. Our approach employs a robotic ultrasound system for automated screenings. To demonstrate the method’s effectiveness, we evaluate our proposed method for the diagnosis and monitoring of abdominal aorta aneurysms as a representative use case.Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed pipeline facilitates robust automated robotic acquisition, mitigating artifacts from breathing motion, and yields smoother 3D reconstructions for enhanced screening and medical diagnosis.

AB  - Mental illness has grown to become a prevalent and global health concern that affects individuals across various demographics. Timely detection and accurate diagnosis of mental disorders are crucial for effective treatment and support as late diagnosis could result in suicidal, harmful behaviors and ultimately death. To this end, the present study introduces a novel pipeline for the analysis of facial expressions, leveraging both the AffectNet and 2013 Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) datasets. Consequently, this research goes beyond traditional diagnostic methods by contributing a system capable of generating a comprehensive mental disorder dataset and concurrently predicting mental disorders based on facial emotional cues. Particularly, we introduce a hybrid architecture for mental disorder detection leveraging the state-of-the-art object detection algorithm, YOLOv8 to detect and classify visual cues associated with specific mental disorders. To achieve accurate predictions, an integrated learning architecture based on the fusion of Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) and Visual Transformer (ViT) models is developed to form an ensemble classifier that predicts the presence of mental illness (e.g., depression, anxiety, and other mental disorder). The overall accuracy is improved to about 81% using the proposed ensemble technique. To ensure transparency and interpretability, we integrate techniques such as Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and saliency maps to highlight the regions in the input image that significantly contribute to the model’s predictions thus providing healthcare professionals with a clear understanding of the features influencing the system’s decisions thereby enhancing trust and more informed diagnostic process.

AB  - Time series forecasting is crucial in numerous sectors, including healthcare, energy, and finance. Transformer models, initially designed for natural language processing applications, demonstrate potential in capturing temporal dependencies within sequential data. In this paper, the application of transformer models in time-series forecasting is explored, and their performance and interpretability are investigated. Transparent models build trust and facilitate decision-making, especially in industries with ethical guidelines. While inherently interpretable time-series Transformers exist, there is a gap in research regarding post hoc methods, which is an area ripe for exploration. Understanding and comparing complex Transformer models for time series forecasting can benefit from advancements in explainability, ensuring accurate and comprehensible predictions. In comparison to five other transformer-based models and classical models, the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model outperformed them in short-term forecasting. Further enhancement of the model performance was achieved through a meticulous analysis of the Encoder-Decoder’s importance, which contributed significantly to refining the forecasting accuracy. The vanilla transformer was explained using permutation feature importance. The model stability was analyzed using perturbation methods.

AB  - The globally rising prevalence of mental disorders leads to shortfalls in timely diagnosis and therapy to reduce patients’ suffering. Facing such an urgent public health problem, professional efforts based on symptom criteria are seriously overstretched. Recently, the successful applications of computer-aided diagnosis approaches have provided timely opportunities to relieve the tension in healthcare services. Particularly, multimodal representation learning gains increasing attention thanks to the high temporal and spatial resolution information extracted from neuroimaging fusion. In this work, we propose an efficient multimodality fusion framework to identify multiple mental disorders based on the combination of functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging. A multioutput conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) is developed to address the scarcity of multimodal data for augmentation. Based on the augmented training data, the multiheaded gating fusion model is proposed for classification by extracting the complementary features across different modalities. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve robust accuracies of  $75.1~\pm ~1.5$ %,  $72.9~\pm ~1.1$ %, and  $87.2~\pm ~1.5$ % for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and schizophrenia, respectively. In addition, the interpretability of our model is expected to enable the identification of remarkable neuropathology diagnostic biomarkers, leading to well-informed therapeutic decisions.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) has enhanced people’s lives by providing high-quality services in cognitive cities, healthcare, and smart devices. However, smart devices often utilize a variety of networks to enable communication and functionality. The large number of networked IoT devices increases the likelihood of IoT attacks, emphasizing the need for secure and privacy-preserving solutions. Security is a critical aspect of smart devices, given the increasing connectivity and potential vulnerabilities associated with their use. Among others, ransomware attacks on IoT devices pose increasing security risks. These assaults can result in severe disruptions and financial losses. The ML classification model techniques are used for the classification of ransomware attacks. However, the ML model techniques are still challenging in accuracy, performance, privacy, and security. Therefore, the Ensemble Learning (EL) model is proposed to address the challenges faced by standalone ML model classification. In the proposed model, ML models are integrated with a Gaussian Process Classifier (GPC) using Stacking Classification Model (SCM) techniques which enhance the performance on various metrics compared with the existing solutions.GPCs offer uncertainty estimates and interpretability, making them advantageous for understanding model confidence and predictions, especially for smaller datasets. The results show that the proposed system can classify ransomware attacks efficiently.

AB  - Bayesian networks (BNs) are graphical models representing uncertainty in causal discovery, and have been widely used in medical diagnosis and gene analysis due to their effectiveness and good interpretability. However, mainstream BN structure learning methods are computationally expensive, as they must perform numerous conditional independence (CI) tests to decide the existence of edges. Some researchers attempt to accelerate the learning process by parallelism, but face issues including load unbalancing, costly dominant parallelism overhead. We propose a multi-thread method, namely Fast-BNS version 1 (Fast-BNS-v1 for short), on multi-core CPUs to enhance the efficiency of the BN structure learning. Fast-BNS-v1 incorporates a series of efficiency optimizations, including a dynamic work pool for better scheduling, grouping CI tests to avoid unnecessary operations, a cache-friendly data storage to improve memory efficiency, and on-the-fly conditioning sets generation to avoid extra memory consumption. To further boost learning performance, we develop a two-level parallel method Fast-BNS-v2 by integrating edge-level parallelism with multi-processes and CI-level parallelism with multi-threads. Fast-BNS-v2 is equipped with careful optimizations including dynamic work stealing for load balancing, SIMD edge list deletion for list updating, and effective communication policies for synchronization. Comprehensive experiments show that our Fast-BNS achieves 9 to 235 times speedup over the state-of-the-art multi-threaded method on a single machine. When running on multi-machines, it further reduces the execution time of the single-machine implementation by 80%.

AB  - The current age is witnessing an unprecedented dependence on data originating from humans through the devices that comprise the Internet of Things. The data collected by these devices are used for many purposes, including predictive maintenance, smart analytics, preventive healthcare, disaster protection, and increased operational efficiency and performance. However, most applications and systems that rely on user data to achieve their business objectives fail to comply with privacy regulations and expose users to numerous privacy threats. Such privacy breaches raise concerns about the legitimacy of the data being processed. Hence, this paper reviews some notable techniques for transparently, securely, and privately separating and sharing personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information in various domains. One of the key findings of this study is that, despite various advantages, none of the existing techniques or data sharing applications preserve data/user privacy throughout the data life cycle. Another significant issue is the lack of transparency for data subjects during the collection, storage, and processing of private data. In addition, as privacy is unique to every user, there cannot be a single autonomous solution to identify and secure personally identifiable information for users of a particular application, system, or people living in different states/countries. Therefore, this research suggests a way forward to prevent the leakage of personally identifiable information at various stages of the data life cycle in compliance with some of the common privacy regulations around the world. The proposed approach aims to empower data owners to select, share, monitor, and control access to their data. In addition, the data owner is a stakeholder and a party to all data sharing contracts related to his personal data. The proposed solution has broad security and privacy controls that can be tailored to the privacy needs of specific applications.

AB  - Privacy problems in blockchain smart contracts arise from the inherent transparency of the technology. While blockchain ensures data integrity, it also exposes sensitive information to all participants. This lack of privacy can be a concern in industries requiring confidentiality, like finance or healthcare, prompting the need for privacy solutions in smart contracts. The existing smart contracts face the problems of over-utilization or under-utilization of privacy parameters due to the unavailability of online or offline privacy classification; smart contracts fall behind in solving privacy issues.In this paper, we introduce the first privacy classification framework for smart contracts. We call our framework oFfloaded privAcy-classified Smart contrAct for bLocKchAins (FASALKA). To be specific, FASALKA runs a novel privacy-ensured smart contract that includes a novel hybrid learning mechanism. This hybrid learning mechanism combines the potential of federated learning and reinforcement learning. We deploy Ethereum on Azure and run a set of experiments to measure the performance of our proposed FASALKA. We compare a general Ethereum framework with an Ethereum framework using our proposed FASALKA. We observe that the Ethereum framework shows 1.1% more latency than the general Ethereum; however, our proposed framework has a similar throughput of 21 TPS. Besides, FASALKA has the 100% accuracy of privacy classification, which is not present in general Ethereum. Thus, our proposed FASALKA is efficient and beneficial for the privacy-ensured blockchains.

AB  - Diabetes is a chronic illness that is common around the world, impacting millions of people and creating serious problems for public health. To avoid complications and enhance patient outcomes, diabetes must be identified early and managed well. We report a thorough investigation of the use of ML methods for forecasting diabetes in this publication. We utilize the Diabetes Dataset for Pima Indians (PIDD), a reputable industry benchmark dataset, for our analysis. Our study begins with data preprocessing steps, including addressing missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features. Subsequently, we partition the dataset into sets for testing as well as training to ensure the robustness of our models. We evaluate a range of techniques for ML, such as LR, RF, GB, KNN, SVM, ANN, DT, LSVM, and NB, for their effectiveness in predicting diabetes. A variety of metrics for performance, such as F1-scoring, accuracy, recall, and precision are used to assess every framework once it has been assessed on the testing set after being trained on the training set. Furthermore, we conduct a comparative analysis of the models, considering factors such as interpretability, complexity, and generalization ability. Our results show promising performance across several ML models, with NB and LR exhibiting particularly high accuracy and precision in predicting diabetes. These findings underscore the potential of ML techniques in facilitating early detection and personalized management of diabetes, thereby contributing to improved patient outcomes and healthcare delivery.

Anomaly detection in real-time data streams is an extremely crucial task for various domains like healthcare, finance, and cyber security but it comes with a few challenges including missing values, class imbalances and noise. Recent research has proved optimal in addressing these challenges using sequential Autoencoders. Our proposed algorithm having the ability to capture temporal dynamics, learn from irregular sequences, improve interpretability and facilitate scalability, propose to help resolve some problems that delimits the potential of existing Autoencoder models. The experiments conducted in the study are utilized to emphasize the potential of our proposed model in handling multifaceted anomalies. The workflow follows semi-supervised learning to leverage the strengths of both supervised and unsupervised approaches. The utility of LTC-AEs are evaluated on various datasets and performance comparison is done with respect to architectures like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM-AE), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU-AE) and Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN-AE) Autoencoders.

AB  - DYNAMITE, an acronym for DYNamic Archetypal analysis for MIning disease TrajEctories, is a new methodology developed specifically to model disease progression by exploiting information available in longitudinal clinical datasets. First, archetypal analysis is applied to data organised in matrix form, with the aim of finding extreme and representative disease states (archetypes) linked to the original data through convex coefficients. Then, each original observation is associated with a single archetype based on their similarity; finally, an event log is created encoding the progression of disease states for each patient in terms of archetype states. In the last stage of the procedure, archetypal analysis is coupled with process mining, which allows the event log archetypes to be visualised graphically as sequences of disease states, allowing the clinical trajectories of patients to be extracted and examined. As a proof of concept, we applied the proposed method to data from a cohort of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients whose progression was monitored using the 12-item ALSFRS-R questionnaire. Without any a priori knowledge, DYNAMITE identified six archetypes clearly describing different types and severity of impairment and provided reliable clinical trajectories consistent with the prognosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients. DYNAMITE offers high interpretability at every stage of the analysis, which makes it particularly suitable for use in healthcare where explainability is paramount, and enables analysis of clinical trajectories at both individual and population levels.

AB  - The prevalence of breast cancer has led to increased interest in its classification among healthcare scholars. Deep learning techniques and self-attention-based transformers have gained popularity in breast image analysis. However, self-attention’s quadratic complexity limits its capacity and interpretability, disregarding sample-to-sample association. To address this issue, a study introduces a novel attention mechanism called External Attention Multi-Layer Perceptron (EAMLP). EAMLP utilizes two external, tiny, learnable, shared retention units implemented with linear and normalization layers. By leveraging the linear complexity of external attention, this approach reduces operational complexity while considering all data point connections. The study evaluates the proposed model’s effectiveness using two publicly available datasets: Breast Histopathology Images and the BreakHis dataset. The model’s performance is assessed using different image sizes and numbers of dense layers. Additionally, a self-attention-based transformer is experimentally tested for comparison. The results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a maximum accuracy of 95.73%.

AB  - Mental health has emerged as a pressing global health public concern due to the rising prevalence of mental illnesses and the notable gap in the detection and diagnosis of these conditions. With the widespread use of text as a means of communication, analysing mental health conditions from text has become essential. Artificial intelligence (AI) for healthcare has seen rapid growth and substantial research. In recent decades, the field of emotion recognition through AI has witnessed a notable shift from statistically shallow models to deep neural networks-based models, but they often grapple with challenges related to data scarcity, interpretability, and context-awareness, which has prompted the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as a viable alternative. However, the introduction of LLMs like Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT)-2 & GPT-Neo has astounded the research community with its unprecedented capabilities, which were previously unseen in traditional deep models. This work evaluates the effectiveness of LLMs-based GPT-Neo-125M and GPT-2 in 3 binary textbased mental health 2-class classification tasks: stress, depression, and suicidality which is, to our knowledge, the first attempt of the kind. This paper demonstrated that GPT-2 delivered higher overall accuracy, notably achieving an accuracy score of over 0.98 across all datasets.

AB  - In this era, wireless networks are economically feasible and flexible to establish in healthcare, defense, surveillance, and traffic monitoring, fire detection. Effective intruder detection systems utilize advanced technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), sensors, and cameras. Traditional approaches for surveillance and intruder detection had faced several challenges which include false alarms, high costs, privacy concerns, and vulnerabilities. To overcome these challenges, a Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad CAM) with Pyramid Vision Transformer-You Only Look Once Enhanced (PViT-YOLOE) namely GRADCAM-PViT-YOLOE is proposed to detect intruders in public places using images and videos. For preprocessing, noise reduction, image resizing, and image segmentation are considered to reduce false positives, enhance memory efficiency, and to reduce complexity. Then, PViT-YOLOE is considered for feature extraction to enhance detection of small objects, enhance robustness to variations. At last, Grad CAM is employed as classifier to detect intruders in public places with improved interpretability, robustness to noise, and flexibility. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed GRADCAM-PViT-YOLOE in terms of accuracy (99.25%), precision (96.75%) recall (89.82%) and F1-Score (87.92%) when compared to the existing method like Faster Regions Convolutional Neural Networks (FR-CNN).

Blockchain is an innovative technology that operates on a decentralized database system, and it has different applications, which include finance, healthcare, and so on. This research proposed a blockchain- IoT-based Model for enhancing the logistics process. The proposed model utilized the Interplanetary file system to secure and efficiently store logistics data on a distributed and decentralized network and the SHA-256 hashing algorithm to ensure users’ private information anonymity. The model also establishes rules by using smart contracts, which increases efficiency. The performance evaluation of the proposed model was done based on the security transactions, latency, cost, and throughput. The experimental results and performance evaluation show that the proposed model is more efficient and secure than the existing blockchain-based systems. Additionally, the proposed model offers the real-time monitoring of goods while in transit. The proposed model solves the IoT logistics system’s Security, storage, and interoperability challenges. It also provides recommendations for logistics stakeholders to adopt blockchain technology. Despite the implications, the limitation of this study is that it was tested in a controlled environment.
