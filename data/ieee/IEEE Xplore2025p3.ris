AB  - Summary <p>Machine learning (ML) as a tool in disease diagnosis has come of age. However, in voluminous medical data, outclasses in analysis for digging out hidden patterns helpful for early detection. Current methodologies are effective, notwithstanding their limitations. This chapter thus presents a new approach &#x2013; a &#x201c;symphony of innovation&#x201d; &#x2013; by redefining disease detection to integrate the established methods with truly groundbreaking advancements systematically.</p> <p>This symphony goes beyond established, well&#x2010;rehearsed routines of current ML practices. It introduces AI orchestration as a new conductor that would work in harmony with all other components involved in the disease detection workflow and adapt to the workflow. Picture a network of hospitals, each equipped with patient data as if playing a concert together. Federated learning is a way to train ML models on this &#x201c;decentralized data,&#x201d; unlocking its power for improved disease detection, especially in the case of rare or geographically isolated cases, while protecting patient privacy in the process &#x2013; just like each hospital keeping its sheet music confidential. Another innovation in this symphony is active learning. Traditionally, training ML models require massive amounts of meticulously labeled data. Active learning algorithms act as a discerning conductor that identifies the most informative data points, reducing the need for manual labeling. This reduces not only the workload for medical professionals but also enables more efficient and targeted data collection.</p> <p>Static models can become useless with a changing healthcare environment and patient populations. This symphony is introducing algorithms of continuous learning. These algorithms function much like an adaptable maestro, continuously ingesting new data streams and dynamically refining their predictions to provide perpetual improvement in disease detection accuracy from day one &#x2013; to keep up with the evolving landscape in healthcare.</p> <p>Generative adversarial networks will elevate the level of innovation further. Now, imagine having to compose a host of entirely new musical pieces &#x2013; all those that would enhance the repertoire of an orchestra. GANs are capable of generating synthetic, false, anonymous patient data. In this way, researchers can train ML models on more extensive and more diverse datasets without being faced with questions about privacy, which is very useful in case of rare diseases with minimal real&#x2010;world data.</p> <p>This symphony of innovation, however, does not end with technological progress but is also reflected in the harmonious concurrence of man's brain and machine expertise.</p> <p>XAI techniques focused on the medical domain will turn out to be critical. As a model, such techniques are bound to provide transparent and interpretable explanations for their predictions, engendering trust and acceptance among medical professionals. Picture a program accompanying a complex musical piece that lets an audience &#x2013; here, doctors &#x2013; understand the intricacies of the performance. AI&#x2010;empowered clinical decision support systems are real&#x2010;time companions for a doctor in arriving at a diagnosis and instituting treatment. They study patient data, offer possible diagnoses, and suggest treatment options. Picture an AI assistant that can provide insights in real&#x2010;time and help doctors make more learned decisions about the clinical history of their patients. The ultimate goal of this symphony is personalized medicine. Armed with a patient's case history, genomic data, and data related to lifestyle habits, AI can predict their individual disease risk and hence help in the formulation of targeted interventions. Proactive healthcare &#x2013; prevention before manifestation of the actual disease &#x2013; is within reach.</p> <p>This vision in disease detection goes beyond the conventionally adopted methods in disease detection. With AI orchestration, human&#x2010;machine collaboration, and ethical concerns, we can unleash the promise of healthcare with very early diagnoses and a treatment regime that makes a difference &#x2013; leading to a genuinely healthful future for all. Such a symphony of innovation is taking to the streets and on course to rewrite the score relating to disease detection; every advancement within its repertoire seems to act as a note of hope in this fight for global health.</p>

AB  - Artificial intelligence tools in healthcare have gained significant attention recently. However, before adopting any new technology, it is essential to identify the challenges associated with its successful implementation. Numerous studies have examined the challenges of using artificial intelligence in healthcare, but a comprehensive classification is lacking. This study aims to summarize these challenges in healthcare services systematically. A systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA standard. Information sources were searched in PubMed, WOS, and Scopus databases using keywords such as “Medicine,” “Diagnosis,” “Health,” “AI,” “artificial intelligence,” “ChatGPT,” “chatbot,” “risk,” “problem,” and “challenge.” The search covered studies published between 2020 and 2025. Initially, 720 articles were identified. After the initial screening and duplicate removal using EndNote21, 52 articles remained. Following a final screening and quality assessment using the CASP checklist, 29 articles were selected for systematic review. Findings revealed significant challenges in AI adoption in healthcare, including data challenges such as low quality and restricted access, technical issues such as system complexity and high costs, managerial obstacles including unclear responsibilities, social concerns such as trust and inclusivity issues, and legal considerations such as a lack of standardization and oversight. These challenges negatively impact AI efficiency, trust, and acceptability in healthcare. Addressing these issues is crucial to enhancing AI adoption in the field. Proper management of these challenges can improve confidence, efficiency, and acceptance, ultimately facilitating the development of AI technologies in healthcare.

AB  - Recurrent seizures that interfere with the quality of a patient's life make up epilepsy, a neurological disorder affecting millions worldwide. Clinical treatment and better patient outcome can be improved with accurate seizure prediction. Yet, current prediction methods are not always interpretable enough such that their use in healthcare is feasible. The focus of this work is to develop and evaluate the use of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) models for seizure prediction, paying particular attention to explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques for enhancing model transparency and trustworthiness. The research attempts to develop very accurate and interpretable predictive models. The various multimodal data sources include EEG recordings and patient demographics. RNNs are used for the prediction of EEG signals, taking into account not only the temporal dependencies of the signals but also improving the predictive performance. First, the datasets will be used in AI models comprising traditional machine learning and XAI methods that are trained on them and rigorously tested through systematic testing as well as prospective clinical trials to assure reliability, practicality, and efficacy in realworld settings. The finding of this study demonstrates how AIpowered seizure prediction, especially with the use of RNNs, can revolutionize customized epilepsy treatment. With an accuracy of 97%, it represents a strong advance in the management of epilepsy: timely and personalized interventions have a high impact on the patient's outcomes and the quality of life of the patients. The techniques like LIME and SHAP help to establish trust with physicians and patients alike, as these models provide information about their underlying decision-making process.

Explicitly the hybrid combined a CNN model to benchmark image classes while implementing Random Forest for metadata evaluation. The model benefits from enhanced generalization through GAN-generated synthetic images which help balance the dataset. The Streamlit-based web application enables users to upload images followed by diagnostic predictions output. The implemented system provides exceptional classification outcomes that allow medical staff to identify skin afflictions at the initial stage. The upcoming work plan consists of enlarging the present dataset while utilizing Explainable AI (XAI) methods and deploying the model on cloud services for simple access..

AB  - The interpretability of machine learning model is crucial in healthcare as it fosters reliability and supports clinicians in making informed decisions based on predictions. However, recent approaches for vital parameter estimation often act as black boxes, lacking clarity in their predictive reasoning. Therefore, accurate estimation of vital parameters is crucial not only for timely diagnosis and effective patient monitoring but also for ensuring that clinicians can trust and understand the model’s predictions. In this study, we introduce XVPE-Net, an explainable framework aimed at improving the state-of-the-art VPE-Net model for estimating vital parameters: heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Our model enhances interpretability by visually highlighting key parts of the PPG signal that significantly influence VPE-Net’s predictions of vital parameters. We test our model using 1,000 PPG segments from 38 subjects in the MIMIC-III dataset, which is available in the Physionet repository. The results show strong predictive capabilities, along with better transparency and reliability. This study helps us understand how the model makes decisions and supports the use of explainable AI in health monitoring, contributing to the development of more reliable models for medical applications.

AB  - Machine learning and explainable AI techniques are powerful mechanisms to analyze the influence of unhealthy food advertisements on health awareness and concern levels. This research aims to predict levels of concern about unhealthy food advertisements and identify significant demographic and behavioral variables that modify the need for these concerns. A survey was conducted, and responses from 1030 adolescents were gathered on their knowledge about food advertisements and what affects their perceptions of health. Stacking Ensemble, Random Forest, and XGBoost with hyperparameter optimization and synthetic oversampling techniques were applied to predict three categories of concern levels in unhealthy food advertisements. Stacking Ensemble, utilizing Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machines as base learners and Logistic Regression as the meta-learner, yielded the highest prediction accuracy of 98.54% and an F1 score of 0.99. The most relevant features for predicting the food advertisement concern levels were age, parental education and advertisement types, such as free toys and celebrity endorsement. LIME and SHAP-integrated interpretability methods have been utilized for a proper understanding of how advertisement strategies influence adolescent health awareness. The developments resulted from growing research efforts in which predictive analytics is connected to explainability in understanding and mitigating the adverse influence of unhealthy food advertisements. The results bear implications for public health policies, advertising regulations, and educational campaigns moving against improved adolescent dietary behaviors and awareness.

AB  - Deep Learning (DL) based artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming pervasive in almost all the day to day applications. These DL algorithms require large amounts of data, which can be easily collected nowadays by deploying sensors in the environment of the system under observation. These DL algorithms however, suffer from drawbacks such as being criticised as ‘black-boxes’, being biased to generating predictions based on past data and ignoring the human expertise. Hence, an architecture of Enhanced eXplainable Digital Twins (EXDTs) was proposed. EXDTs remove ‘black-boxness’ of DL algorithms by using the XAI approaches. Further, the digital twins (DTs) underlying the EXDTs are constructed through the sensor data and depict the real-time simulatability. Also, to improve the explainability and use the human expertise/ experience, EXDTs use the domain experts’ qualitative data. EXDTs are a class of Hybrid AI systems, that use the numeric data for underlying DL algorithms and subjective knowledge of the domain expert. This multimodal data in EXDTs opens up new attacks fronts for data manipulation and change the EXDTs’ outputs. In this manuscript, we discuss about the data protection in EXDTs, by simulating various types of attacks and suggesting possible ways the system can counter them. We feel our proposed framework is useful for the involved stakeholders in various domains like precision agriculture, healthcare, manufacturing, etc.

AB  - The fast uptake of IoT-enabled medical devices to create smart hospitals has revolutionized healthcare delivery, affording real-time monitoring and personalized diagnostics. But, the central training of AI models based on patient data raises serious issues of privacy, transparency, and trust. This work proposes an Explainable Federated Learning (XFL) framework that jointly integrates Explainable AI (XAI) mechanisms with Federated Learning (FL) to enable a secure, privacy-preserving, interpretable medical diagnostic across decentralized healthcare systems. The proposed XFL framework uses edge-based federated optimization to train deep neural models on decentralized patient data, maintaining the locality of that data. The framework enables mutual co-existence of model-agnostic explainability mechanisms such as SHAP and LIME which generate human-comprehensible justifications for a diagnostic decision, improving clinical trust and accountability. To enhance model robustness and confidentiality of the data, we integrate differential privacy, secure aggregation, and lightweight blockchain logging, allowing for auditability and protection against adversarial attacks. We provide experiments using real-world healthcare datasets such as COVIDx and MIMIC-III to demonstrate that our framework can build diagnostic models with competitive accuracy, while providing strong privacy assurances and information for clinicians. This work responds to an urgent requirement in AI-enabled healthcare; not only should it ensure what a model predicts, but also why, so that smart hospital ecosystems may be ethically aligned, safe, and transparent.

AB  - Intelligent medical diagnostic technologies play a crucial role in enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of disease identification and diagnosis. However, their integration into patient-doctor interactions, which involve a complex mix of fuzzy information and quantitative data, remains underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by introducing hesitant fuzzy set (HFS), which are adept at handling subjective inputs, and by developing an intelligent diagnostic framework based on advanced Transformer networks. Specifically, we define the concepts of ascending hesitant fuzzy set (AHFS) and multidimensional hesitant fuzzy set (MHFS), based on HFS, to better capture and refine the dynamic interactions between patients and clinicians. We then introduce an intelligent diagnostic methodology that effectively processes both fuzzy data and real numbers within the multidimensional hesitant fuzzy Transformer (MHF- Transformer) networks. This approach offers notable advantages, including improved interpretability of diagnostic results, enhanced adaptability to complex medical scenarios, and robustness in handling uncertainty and incomplete data. To further enhance the adaptability of this method and reduce the risk of misdiagnosis in intelligent diagnostics, an expert review mechanism is incorporated into the output layer. Additionally, we design a comprehensive optimization algorithm for the MHF-Transformer networks, complete with detailed execution protocols and pseudocode, strengthening the reliability of intelligent diagnostics. Finally, we apply the MHF-Transformer networks to two clinical scenarios: the diagnosis of mental disorders and the recurrence assessment of thyroid cancer. The empirical findings and comparative analyses provide strong evidence of the efficacy, practicality, and superior performance of the proposed intelligent diagnostic method.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) play a crucial role in developing disruptive healthcare technologies since they address the needs of consumers by providing precise and effective diagnostic and decision-making capabilities. The influence of these factors on diagnosing and making decisions is especially noteworthy when collecting valuable information from healthcare data. This work offers “AC2” (Accurate Cardiac Classification), a hybrid deep learning model that correctly detects cardiovascular disease (CVD) and provides meaningful insights. Convolutional neural networks and the Light Gradient Boosting Model integrate well in the “AC2” model, simplifying feature learning and predictions. Using the CDC’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset, the proposed method outperforms current algorithms in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This dataset collects reliable, state-specific data on preventive health practices and risk behaviors related to chronic illnesses, injuries, and avoidable infections in adults, catering to the information needs of healthcare consumers. The “AC2” model’s outstanding forecast accuracy is further improved by integrating an explainable AI methodology, specifically emphasizing SHAP’s local and global explanations. These explanatory insights clarify the model’s decision-making process. With healthcare technology’s advancement and the requirement for efficient data analysis to gather information, the “AC2” model’s accuracy and comprehensibility may substantially improve healthcare professionals’ diagnosis and treatment skills, benefiting healthcare consumers.

AB  - Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) pose a global health challenge due to their increasing incidence and delayed detection, compounded by the burden they place on healthcare systems worldwide. This surge is particularly pronounced in both industrialized and emerging nations, fueled by the rising prevalence of conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. While Artificial Intelligence (AI) shows promise for early CKD detection, issues with data security, model transparency, and decision-making trust have created uncertainty among both patients and healthcare providers. To tackle these issues, a decentralized collaborative learning framework utilizing explainable AI to detect CKD is proposed. This approach combines the privacy-preserving nature of blockchain technology with the interpretability of explainable AI models. A real-time environment was set up to conduct these experiments, simulating a network of healthcare providers collaborating on CKD detection while maintaining patient privacy.

AB  - Heart Disease has become the leading cause of death of millions of people worldwide. Conventional method often lacks the precision needed for diagnosing this disease in an effective manner, therefore indicating the need for advance tools that can provide accurate information. Our study addresses this gap by creating a framework in which ML techniques are integrated with Explainable AI, Risk Stratification and Survival analysis to improve the heart disease prediction efficiently. This study uses a publicly available dataset from the trusted source Kaggle, to analyze the patterns present in it and hence can apply preprocessing techniques and Recursive Feature Elimination. Five ML models were used in this research such as Random Forest, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor and Logistic Regression and among these models Random Forest obtained the highest accuracy of $92.79 \%$ and also other performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1- score and confidence intervals were calculated, so that effective evaluation can be made. To ensure interpretability SHAP (Shapley Additive explanation) was used to identify critical features such as cholesterol and age. Afterwards, k-means clustering and survival analysis stratified the individuals into specific risk groups, which offered useful insights in effective assessment of heart disease, so that healthcare professionals can strategize the targeted treatment for the patients with the disease.

AB  - Atrial fibrillation is one of the most prevalent types of cardiac arrhythmias and has strong connections to stroke and heart failure. Its early detection is often hindered by variability in EGC signals, especially in cases of paroxysmal AF. The development of AI has recently removed some stubborn barriers to AF detection through the application of deep learning techniques. This paper systematically reviews 12 current studies published between 2023 and 2024 that employed AI models for AF detection with varying ECG modalities, including single-lead, 12-lead, and image-based ECG. The paper is organized by the data types present in the studies, the preprocessing of these data, the AI architectures used, and validation protocols in use within the clinical setup. Our findings indicate that attention-based networks, hierarchical models, and features extraction techniques, such as chirplet transforms, have effectively improved the detection accuracy of AF. In addition, we look at the role of wearable and mobile technologies regarding ECG by comparing smart device-based AI algorithms with traditional ones used in diagnostic practice. Also discussed will be challenges such as dataset imbalance, signal noise from wearable devices, interpretable AI models, and cross-platform validation. The paper summarizes with future directions of AI in improving diagnostic inclusion, toward transparency, and embedding these technologies into everyday clinical practice.

AB  - The Diabetic Retinopathy Detection System is a groundbreaking approach that uses machine learning to tackle one of the most common complications of diabetes which is diabetic retinopathy and its detection. This condition, if left unchecked, can lead to severe vision problems and even blindness. By analyzing the data of the patient like blood sugar levels, the period of diabetes, and high-quality retinal images, the system can identify patterns that indicate early signs of DR. This allows doctors to categorize patients based on their risk level and recommend timely, personalized treatment plans.What makes this system especially valuable is its ability to highlight the most important warning signs of diabetic retinopathy. By detecting features like small blood vessel damage (microaneurysms), abnormal fluid buildup (exudates), or tiny areas of bleeding (hemorrhages), it gives eye specialists the tools to focus on what matters most during their assessments. Combining these insights with detailed retinal imaging ensures that even subtle changes in the eyes are identified early—before they become a bigger problem.In short, this system is a game-changer for managing diabetic eye health. By combining cutting-edge technology with a focus on patient-centered care, it offers a smarter, more efficient way to detect and address diabetic retinopathy early, helping patients maintain their vision and live healthier lives.

AB  - Heart disease remains among the leading causes of mortality all over the world, and early detection is required to improve the prognosis of patients. Traditional methods of detection are not necessarily accurate or effective, thus the demand for advanced predictive models. This research addresses the challenge of advancing heart disease predictive precision using machine learning algorithms, i.e., Random Forest and Decision Trees. A cardiovascular dataset was processed in advance to deal with missing values, detection of outliers, and normalization in order to have data quality ensured. Models were compared against accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC, and Random Forest proved 85% accuracy, more reliable than Decision Trees as it was not overfitted. The work illustrates predictability vs. interpretability and indicates feature importance analysis to favour clinician confidence. The outcomes are decisive that machine learning has the potential to augment early intervention and diagnosis planning in cardiology and deliver data-based clinical decision-making and risk assessment.

The novelty of this approach lies in a radiomics-inspired paradigm and machine learning for photographic imaging. A key strength of this study is the incorporation of explainable AI through partial dependence plots, ensuring validation of the proposed method and uncovering clinically meaningful insights for more interpretable, more trustworthy and informed decision-making. The dataset included high-resolution RGB and color-rendered images from 79 patients, along with clinical and demographic data such as age, gender, oral hygiene index, and gingival bleeding. Features were extracted using Pyradiomics from manually segmented plaque regions. Feature selection was performed using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), followed by the application of multiple machine learning algorithms for classification. Results revealed that the blue color channel of plaque areas achieved the highest accuracy (80%) in distinguishing moderate from severe periodontitis, emphasizing the different fluorescent properties of plaque and teeth, induced by blue light. Notably, sphericity emerged as a key shape feature: as sphericity increased, predictions leaned toward less severe periodontitis, which is consistent with the clinical observation that more circular plaque areas tend to indicate localized and less extensive disease. These clinically relevant insights not only validate the proposed approach applied to intraoral photographic images but also demonstrate its reliability, paving the way for new, more explainable diagnostic methodologies.

AB  - The rapid development of multimodal data analysis has transformed fields, including social sciences, healthcare, and genetics. Multimodal techniques increase predictive accuracy, enable strong decision-making, and enhance tailored treatments by incorporating visuals, text, sensor outputs, and genomic sequences-many different data kinds. However, handling diverse, high-dimensional data presents significant difficulties in scalability, integration, and processing efficiency; hence, creative fusion methods and AI-driven models are quite necessary. With an eye on applications in neurodegenerative disease diagnosis, cancer detection, and precision medicine, this work investigates developing trends, approaches, and obstacles in multimodal data processing. With statistical and deep learning systems, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Transformers, and Bayesian models, we cover fusion methodologies, including early/late integration, kernel-based alignment, and active subspace analysis. Unified data pipelines are shown in case studies of multimodal systems, including INSMA for ICU monitoring and SCALA for genetic profiling, to be rather useful. While it offers scalable infrastructure, interpretable artificial intelligence, and cost effective computational solutions, multimodal analysis constantly struggles with noise reduction, data harmonization, and cross-modal learning. Real-time multimodal integration, including social variables in disease prediction and translational bioinformatics, should be a top priority in future studies to increase clinical relevance and extend society's impact.

AB  - This paper provides a framework for knowledge and action related to and about substance abuse, that integrates both capacity development and data-driven analysis for drug use analysis and modeling. In line with the National Action Plan for Drug Demand Reduction (NAPDDR) the framework focuses on a multi-pronged strategy. It then gives examples of so-called capacity-building exercises, such as those carried out by Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham in Tamil Nadu in 2020. These programs targeted key stakeholders, including healthcare professionals, police personnel, teachers, and social workers, focusing on preventive education, medical management, psychosocial issues, and rehabilitation strategies related to substance abuse. Pre- and post-training evaluations showed a strong increase in participants knowledge and treatment skills for substance use disorders. Second, the paper presents a data-driven, quantitative analysis of drug use patterns and related factors. Using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, the study utilizes a dataset of drug consumption patterns to determine the factors which are most important for drug consumption. Importantly, the framework also include Explainable AI (XAI) methods to increase the interpretability and tracibility of the machine learning model. XAI approaches are used to interpret the model's decision process and to identify the most important factors in predicting the use of drugs. Incorporating insights from the capacity-building program evaluation and from the XAI-aided machine learning analysis, this framework provides an integrated end-to-end framework for drug user analysis and the generation of actionable recommendations for the design of targeted interventions and prevention strategies.

AB  - Modern healthcare is increasingly relying on Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) systems, which continuously collect health data and provide the ability to monitor patients in real-time. RPM systems are extremely susceptible to cyber threats due to their growing reliance on interconnected devices and hence need comprehensive security. AI has emerged as a crucial technology for addressing security issues in RPM systems. The objective of this survey is to understand the impact on the security of RPM systems by integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) with threat intelligence. This survey analyzed 86 research articles from leading databases related to AI models, security of RPM systems, anomaly detection, and architectural solutions, in addition to 24 articles related to existing RPMs. This survey article emphasizes that RPM systems become much more resilient when automated attack mitigation, real-time anomaly detection, and predictive analytics are provided by AI-powered models. To secure the sensitive data in RPM, this survey discusses how AI can be applied to various architectural solutions, including edge computing, cloud integration, blockchain technology, and Federated Learning (FL). Furthermore, the benefits and challenges of deploying AI-driven threat intelligence, cross-platform compatibility, and the need for explainable AI to improve trust in automatically made decisions are presented. Moreover, this review highlights research gaps, including the necessity of comprehensive end-to-end architectures for maintaining security and privacy in RPM systems. It is revealed through this survey that AI-powered threat intelligence enhances RPM security considerably due to its ability of continuous monitoring, adaptive defense mechanisms, and early detection of threats. However, challenges such as the explainability of AI models persist and necessitate continued innovation. The survey paper suggests integrating AI-enhanced threat Detection as a Service (TDaas) that implements FL to transform the existing RPM security system, and ultimately contributes to a secure and reliable threat detection system in healthcare. This review provides a roadmap for future research in the area of AI-driven threat intelligence security for RPM systems and offers insights for developing resilient healthcare infrastructure.

AB  - Maternal and child health outcomes heavily depend on accessing rightful healthcare services for both newborns and postnatal periods. The paper presents HealthAccessNet-RL as a Reinforcement Learning-Based Model which analyzes legal frameworks to optimize access to neonatal and postnatal healthcare. The model implements Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) from the Reinforcement Learning (RL) technique to evaluate legal provisions and produce simulated policy recommendations for optimized legal interventions. The policy recommendation accuracy of the A2C model achieved 89% while DQN's accuracy reached only 85%. The model underwent testing with diverse legal data from multiple jurisdictions and achieved substantial PES and AS improvements which amounted to an average 48% rise in low-income contexts and 42% increase in developing nations. The evaluation through sentiment analysis showed overwhelming support at rates higher than 75% for both experts and the public who wanted changes in neonatal emergency care together with maternity leave policies. The model demonstrates excellent efficiency in legal assessment making it an effective decision-making tool for those who want to improve worldwide maternal and child healthcare accessibility. Research in upcoming phases will look at expanding the model across multiple healthcare areas combined with Explainable AI (XAI) tools to enhance visibility of its legal recommendation processes.

AB  - This paper presents a comprehensive study on the application of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) for diabetes risk assessment, focusing on the interpretability of machine learning models in clinical decision support systems. While machine learning has demonstrated high accuracy in predicting diabetes, the lack of transparency in decision-making processes limits its adoption in healthcare. We employ interpretable models and model-agnostic explanation techniques such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) to enhance the understanding of predictive outcomes. Using real-world datasets including the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset and NHANES, we evaluate both the performance and explainability of various models. Our experiments show that the XGBoost model achieved the highest prediction accuracy of 86.5%, with an AUC-ROC of 0.91, followed by the Neural Network (MLP) with 85.2% accuracy and AUC-ROC of 0.90. Interpretable models like Logistic Regression and Decision Tree reported lower accuracies of 78.2% and 81.0% respectively, but offered high interpretability. The combination of these predictive models with SHAP and LIME enhances clinical applicability by aligning model reasoning with physician insight. Case evaluations demonstrated that LIME's local explanations matched physician reasoning in 87% of tested scenarios.➢ Integration of SHAP and LIME in both training and clinical phases➢ Case-wise physician matching study (87%)➢ Performance-explainability tradeoff analysis across 6 ML models

AB  - We present a machine learning optimization approach for task allocation between teams of robots and nurses working collaboratively in a hospital unit. We address task allocation challenges through a recommender system that optimizes the collaboration between nursing staff and robotic nursing assistants through a two-phase methodology. First, we implement a simulated hospital environment featuring synthetic robots and nurses to collect 3D simulation data. Second, we leverage an explainable pre-hoc machine learning framework using Factorization Machines to learn and predict optimal task allocation patterns. Tasks include navigation, mobility, and item delivery for patients in a hospital unit. Our findings demonstrate that the explainable pre-hoc framework predicts efficient allocations with 94% accuracy, while offering the advantage of explainability, with task difficulty emerging as the most influential feature. Experimental results show that robots outperform nurses in completing easy tasks, while nurses perform more consistently across varying difficulty levels. This research contributes to healthcare automation by introducing a transparent task allocation system with the potential to mitigate nurse shortages, enhance workflow efficiency, and improve healthcare delivery. Our approach emphasizes the importance of explainable AI in healthcare settings and offers a novel solution to this critical optimization challenge.

AB  - This work presents an advanced, privacy-aware diagnosis system for predicting kidney stones using a combination of Vision Transformers (ViT), federated learning, and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). Unlike traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the proposed method utilizes Vision Transformers, which can represent complex spatial patterns and understand long-range dependencies in medical images, such as CT scans. It allows for careful and holistic analysis of slight changes in renal architectural features that may indicate pathologic conditions. The federated learning framework is used to ensure both data privacy and compliance with medical data regulations. This decentralization in training allows multiple healthcare organizations to train the model while ensuring patient information remains private and collaborative. In this approach, rather than collecting raw patient data from local nodes, model parameters are gathered. This not only preserves patient anonymity but also enhances the generalizability of the model. Moreover, the system utilizes multimodal data fusion by integrating CT imaging and structured clinical data, including age, medical background, and physiological features. This is done through a hybrid network that combines transformer encoders for image and tabular input to allow the model to leverage complementary modalities and improve diagnostic accuracy. Interpretability is a key part of the system. Explainability methods such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) are employed to ensure clinical trust and promote transparency. These tools generate visual and feature-based explanations to help physicians understand how the model arrived at a certain prediction. The experimental evaluations verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach and achieve high accuracy and reliability for kidney stone diagnosis. The combination of ViT, federated learning, and XAI forms a solid and scalable technology suitable for practical applications in the medical field, allowing for early diagnosis while maintaining the privacy of patients and enhancing clinical decision-making.

AB  - To enhance patient prognosis, identifying and diagnosing brain tumors at an early stage are significantly important. For this purpose, we present a hybrid machine learning based framework for brain tumor identification which utilizes principal component analysis (PCA), support vector classifiers (SHC), and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) for optimal performance and interpretability. In medical imaging data, the degree of complexity and variety is so high that in order to improve efficiency and minimize overfitting, it is more reasonable to employ dimensions reduction techniques which as support vector classifiers (SVC) PCA to SVC is used in Shapley to increase computation speed without loss of important diagnostic features. Because of its robustness to high-dimensional data and ability to provide clear decision boundaries, SVC is used as the primary classifier, while logistic regression is employed as the benchmark for comparison. To enhance the explainability of machine learning healthcare models, SHAP is used to understand the role different predictors play which will in turn increase clinicians trust in the model. The approach is aimed to the Brain Tumor MRI Dataset at Kaggle, where the model has claimed to have outperformed others. The model outperforms the baseline model in terms of accuracy, precision and recall when identifying cases with and without a brain tumor. Through the integration of dimensionality reduction and interpretable machine learning techniques, we not only achieve accurate diagnostic results, but also address the issue of reconciling sophisticated algorithmic models with clinical use. This approach serves as a potential real-time brain tumor diagnosis and patient management tool.

AB  - Modern healthcare is changing as a result of cutting-edge technology like blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI). Healthcare professionals can identify health problems more quickly and accurately thanks to AI-driven diagnostic technologies, which promotes early intervention and better patient outcomes. AI is also capable of analysing enormous volumes of data from patients to find hidden patterns that will help with more individualised care and more accurate treatment recommendations. Block chain technology, meanwhile, improves healthcare data security and transparency. Patients may ensure the confidentiality of their data while gaining more control over their health data by insisting block chain technology. Additionally, healthcare providers can safely exchange patient data between institutions, which promotes better health outcomes and care coordination. Cloud computing is an exciting new technology that is expected to revolution the healthcare sector. Among the many advantages of cloud computing are resource sharing, adaptability, energy and cost savings, and rapid adoption. Patients and medical professionals have various security and privacy issues due to the cloud's accumulation of data. The devolution of control of data to cloud service suppliers and data centralization, which provides hackers with a one-stop honey pot to steal data and intercepted data in motion, have resulted in the removal of sensitive data from the hands of individuals and healthcare providers. This study examines a number of cloud safety and privacy problems in addition to the uses of computing through the cloud in healthcare. Consequently, the widespread use of cloud computing is being delayed by doubts about its effectiveness, security, privacy, and scalability.

AB  - Kidney disease is a serious worldwide health concern that can be improved by early detection and efficient monitoring. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a recent development in artificial intelligence (AI), have greatly improved the precision of kidney disease segmentation and classification in medical imaging. Furthermore, conversational AI has become a useful tool for supporting patient interaction and early diagnosis. 40 research studies on CNN-based renal illness classification, semantic segmentation methods, and AI-driven chatbots for kidney disease detection are thoroughly examined in this review paper. We emphasize the advantages, disadvantages, and performance indicators of different datasets, preprocessing strategies, feature extraction approaches, and deep learning architectures. According to the results, CNN-based models such as U-Net, ResNet, and Vision Transformers have segmented kidney structures with remarkable accuracy, and hybrid AI chatbots that combine machine learning and natural language processing show promise in supporting clinical decision-making. But there are still issues like model generalizability, dataset constraints, and ethical issues. In addition to pointing out current research gaps, this study offers suggestions for future paths, such as better explainability of AI models, multimodal data integration, and improved chatbot interactions for individualized healthcare.

AB  - This work introduces a novel approach to patient risk prediction which uses a combined Logistic Regression and XGBoost for EHR analysis. The objective is to advance the performance of two models for predicting patient outcomes, like readmission to the hospital or worsening of the condition. Logistic Regression has a form of interpretability that is suitable for healthcare use, and XGBoost identifies and models complex interactions in data. The ensemble technique was developed by implementing a stacking method where the meta-learner constitutes the Logistic Regression classifier. Performance enhancement was performed by hyperparameter tuning on both models. The proposed ensemble model outperformed individual models achieving an accuracy of 93.17%. Additionally, other XAI techniques such as SHAP are utilized to provide clear and precise information to the patient based on his / her results from the model. It gives clinical professionals a consistent and easy-to-understand AI-based tool that supports improved patient care.

AB  - Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is increasingly essential as AI systems are deployed in critical fields such as healthcare and finance, offering transparency into AI-driven decisions. Two major XAI paradigms, counterfactual explanations (CFX) and feature attribution (FA), serve distinct roles in model interpretability. This study introduces GradCFA, a hybrid framework combining CFX and FA to improve interpretability by explicitly optimizing feasibility, plausibility, and diversity—key qualities often unbalanced in existing methods. Unlike most CFX research focused on binary classification, GradCFA extends to multi-class scenarios, supporting a wider range of applications. We evaluate GradCFA’s validity, proximity, sparsity, plausibility, and diversity against state-of-the-art methods, including Wachter, DiCE, CARE for CFX, and SHAP for FA. Results show GradCFA effectively generates feasible, plausible, and diverse counterfactuals while offering valuable FA insights. By identifying influential features and validating their impact, GradCFA advances AI interpretability.

AB  - The central nervous system is impacted by multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic neurological condition that causes significant cognitive and physical deficits. Better disease management and prompt intervention depend on early and precise detection. Effective diagnosis of MS is hampered by a number of factors, such as small datasets, significant clinical presentation variability, difficult feature selection, model generalization problems, and integration of multimodal data such as magnetic resonance imaging and genetic markers. Several machine learning (ML) models are assessed in this study in order to predict the development of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) to multiple sclerosis. Using clinical and magnetic resonance data from patients with CIS at risk of developing MS, we evaluate the effectiveness of support vector machines (SVM), K nearest neighbor (KNN), decision trees (DT), random forests (RF), logistic regression (LR), Gaussian naive Bayes (Gaussian NB) and XGBoost (XG). Evaluation is performed using performance criteria including F1 score, recall, precision, and precision. According to our research, Random Forest has the best prediction accuracy, which makes it a potentially useful tool for helping doctors diagnose and treat MS patients early. Notwithstanding these developments, issues like model interpretability and data scarcity still exist. In order to improve diagnosis precision, future research will concentrate on enhancing these models by integrating deep learning methods, genetic markers,, and more advanced imaging modalities.

AB  - Dengue fever remains a significant public health concern, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) like Nigeria, where its prevalence is driven by a combination of socioeconomic and environmental factors. This study explores the application of machine learning (ML) techniques to enhance the diagnosis of dengue fever, with a focus on rule-based classifiers to provide greater transparency and interpretability in medical decision-making. The dataset comprised over 4,800 patient records obtained from secondary and tertiary healthcare facilities in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria, with contributions from 62 experienced physicians specializing in febrile illnesses. Two rule-based classifiers, RIPPER and PART, were employed to assess their effectiveness in predicting dengue fever cases using causative data. Both models demonstrated similar performance in accuracy, sensitivity and precision indicating their strength in accurately identifying true dengue cases, which is critical for timely intervention and treatment. This study will benefit the different public stakeholders as it underscores the potential of rule-based ML models to improve the accuracy of dengue fever diagnoses in LMICs, enhancing public health efforts and optimizing resource allocation in poorer African regions where dengue is endemic.

AB  - Blood cell classification is a crucial task in medical diagnostics. This work can identify different blood cell types that play essential roles in the immune system and overall body function. This research introduces a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model with SHAP for explainable multiclass classification of blood cell images. We classify eight types of blood cells—basophil, eosinophil, erythroblast, immunoglobulin (Ig), lymphocyte, monocyte, neutrophil, and platelet. An ablation study was conducted to optimize the CNN architecture. We compared its performance with eleven transfer learning models, including VGG16, ResNet101, and EfficientNet variants. Our model achieved 92.60% accuracy while maintaining lower complexity. The use of SHAP provides transparency by highlighting crucial features in the model’s decision-making process.

AB  - Deploying new systems of Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially deep learning, has led to revolutionary use cases in every industry. But these innovations also come with greater concerns about data privacy, data security, and transparency - especially when it comes to sensitive user data. And one of the most innovative technologies that is there to help tackle these challenges is blockchain technology given its decentralized, immutable and transparent nature. Inspired by the mechanism behind deep learning and blockchain, the research successfully investigates the possibility of combining deep learning u blockchain together to realise the decentralised AI applications while ensuring data integrity, privacy, и security. In this paper, we present a new framework that merges the efficiency of deep learning models with the decentralized structure of blockchain. The access and data sharing security enforced by smart contracts and federated learning of deep learning model takes place in the protected way without disclosure of raw data. By logging model updates, transactions and decisions - blockchain allows data immutability and auditability - increasing trust among the stakeholders. A case study of a privacy-sensitive application, e.g., healthcare or financial services, is designed, which helps validate the proposed approach. The experimental results show that the integrated system realizes robust model performance and guarantees data privacy and transparent operation. Moreover, we analyze the scalability of the solution in terms of the latency and throughput of blockchain transactions and the efficiency of federated learning at distributed nodes. The study offers important insights for surmounting challenge related to merging deep learning and blockchain e.g., computational overhead, scalability and energy efficiency. Additionally, we discuss how such an integrated paradigm could foster the development of a new kind of decentralized AI applications, leading to ethical and secure AI systems that comply with existing global data privacy laws such as GDPR and CCPA. The implications of this research are significant, as they highlight the potential of blockchainintegrated deep learning systems to promote secure, transparent, and privacy-preserving decentralized AI applications, thereby laying the groundwork for future advancements in secure AI deployment.

AB  - The convergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) has paved the way for a new technological paradigm in Healthcare Industry 5.0. This integration addresses the complexity, heterogeneity, and dynamic nature of smart IoT devices within healthcare systems. However, it also increases the risk of cyberattacks, particularly Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, which pose significant threats to such critical infrastructure. While Deep Learning (DL)-based intrusion detection methods have demonstrated high accuracy in detecting these attacks, their opaque decision-making process often leads to their characterization as black-box models, limiting their practical use for security analysts. To overcome these challenges, this study proposes an explainable hybrid model for DDoS attack detection in SDN-IoT-based Healthcare Industry 5.0 environments. The model combines the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for spatial feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for capturing temporal dependencies in network traffic. Implemented using an SDN controller, the model accurately classifies DDoS and IoT attacks while providing transparency through the SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) method, which identifies the most influential features in the model’s decision-making process. Simulation results on the CICDDoS2019 and IoT Healthcare Security datasets demonstrate the model’s effectiveness, achieving detection accuracy of 99.59% and 98.12%, respectively. These findings confirm the robustness of the proposed hybrid model compared to state-of-the-art methods for detecting potential attacks in Healthcare Industry 5.0 systems.

AB  - Artificial intelligence - Machine learning (ML) is an emergent area of AI that aims to enhance the capability of a system to make predictions or decisions based on the data fed to it without the system being specifically programmed for such functions. Its importance stems from its capacity to analyze and abstract information, predict, and even make decisions in various contexts, transforming sectors such as healthcare, finance, and technology. With the increasingly large volume of data being created, the role played by ML in processing this data to discover meaningful patterns becomes more prominent. ML algorithms can be broadly categorized into three main types: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Linear regression and support vector machines, for instance, work from labeled training sets in order to make predictions and classifications. Such algorithms are used in many applications, like face recognition, filtering spam emails, and even diagnosing diseases. On the other hand, unsupervised learning operators, including K-means clustering and principal component analysis, work with data sets lacking labels to discover latent structures and patterns common in market segmentation and anomaly detection. Reinforcement learning can be viewed as enabling an agent to take a set of actions in an environment to maximize the total reward, as in Q-learning. This approach is especially useful in applications such as robotics, games, and the use of autonomous systems. In summary, machine learning algorithms are a key differentiator in improving productivity and fostering innovation, thereby facilitating advancements across various industries while creating future possibilities in artificial intelligence.

AB  - Brain Tumor Classification (BTC) using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has seen significant advancements with the adoption of Deep Learning (DL) models, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, the black-box nature of these models raises concerns regarding explainability, which is crucial in the healthcare domain. For this reason, research in BTC has increasingly focused on the application of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, mainly through post-hoc methods, with the aim of providing insights into model decisions. This work explores an alternative approach based on inherently interpretable models, specifically Fuzzy Decision Trees (FDTs). We analyze different types of FDTs, showing that they achieve good performance while ensuring high explainability levels, without the need for post-hoc explanations.

AB  - Healthcare 5.0, driven by the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), introduces transformative changes in the medical field but also exposes systems to growing cybersecurity threats. While Deep Learning (DL) offers high accuracy in attack detection, its effectiveness is often limited by data imbalance and difficulty in identifying key features dynamically. Additionally, DL models are often criticized for their lack of interpretability, as their internal decisionmaking remains obscure. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents an explainable and adaptive DL-based security framework. It integrates a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to balance the dataset by generating realistic samples for underrepresented attack classes, and employs Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) to identify temporal patterns and critical features. To enhance transparency, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Permutation Feature Importance (PFI) are used for interpreting the model's decisions. Experiments conducted on the NSL-KDD dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving 93.81% accuracy and an F1-score of 82.95%.

AB  - Timely and accurate detection and classification of lung diseases are critical for effective diagnosis and treatment planning. This paper presents a deep learning approach to distinguish COVID-19 from normal cases using chest X-ray images, employing the VGG-16 convolutional neural network (CNN) model. To enhance interpretability and trust in the model's decisions, we integrate Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques–Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, and Score-CAM–to visualize and interpret the features contributing to the classification outcomes. Our model achieved an accuracy of 98.68%, highlighting the effectiveness of the VGG-16 architecture for this task. Each XAI method provided unique insights: Grad-CAM localized general feature regions, Grad-CAM++ offered more refined and detailed heatmaps, and Score-CAM produced clearer, gradient-free visual explanations that enhance transparency and stability. Our findings indicate that Score-CAM outperforms the other techniques by providing stable, precise heatmaps, making it particularly suitable for clinical use. This combination of high accuracy and interpretability supports the applicability of AI-driven diagnostics in real-world healthcare settings, fostering trust and reliability in automated lung disease classification.

To enhance model interpretability, we used Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (GradCAM) visualization, which emphasizes areas of interest that affect the model's diagnostic decisions. The optimization of the model is achieved by using a custom loss function which combines mean absolute error, mean squared error, and structural similarity index to balance pixel-level accuracy with quality in image reconstruction. Our model achieves 91\% classification accuracy, with 93% precision for Malignant tumour detection. The proposed model attained a best-balanced performance for both classes, with F1-scores of 0.88 and 0.92 for benign and malignant cases in the 10x magnifications, respectively. Grad-CAM visualizations confirm the model's ability to focus on clinically relevant image regions at both 10x and 40x magnifications, providing healthcare professionals with transparent insights into the decision-making process.

AB  - When artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models are applied in healthcare, the ability to understand and explain model decisions is an important aspect. Methods in the field of explainable AI (XAI) have been developed to create explanations for such decisions, which provides transparency and trust to the prediction model. However, the use of XAI-based explanations as added data features for the purpose of improving prediction performance remains a little explored topic. Our proposed Explanation Supported Learning (XSL) framework can improve classification performance for ML models used in medical imaging systems, while also providing a new understanding of how medical images are processed by deep learning (DL) models. The XSL framework consists of novel methods to achieve knowledge transfer from one or several teacher models to a student model. The novelty lies in using explanations from the teacher models, obtained from XAI techniques, as added features when training the student model. This approach enables flexible knowledge transfer between models of different architecture types. We further demonstrate how the XSL framework can be used as a new metric for measuring the quality of the explanations provided by XAI methods. The achievement of increased performance in this framework requires that the chosen XAI technique contains useful information based on the learned understanding of the input data by the teacher models. By testing XSL on the HyperKvasir gastrointestinal image dataset, we achieved significant increases in most of the measured classification metrics, and exceeded most benchmark scores of the HyperKvasir paper. Our code is available on GitHub.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) pose significant health challenges, necessitating early diagnosis to reduce mortality rates. This study proposes an effective predictive model for heart disease using a merged dataset from Switzerland, Hungarian, VA, Long Beach, Statlog, and Cleveland. We utilized robust strategies for gathering, cleaning, and transforming data to ensure the training dataset's accuracy and reliability. Using the Relief and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) techniques, appropriate features were chosen. The K-Nearest Neighbors Bagging Method (KNNBM), Gradient Boosting Method (GBBM), Random Forest Bagging Method (RFBM), Decision Tree Bagging Method (DTBM), and AdaBoost Boosting Method (ABBM) are examples of hybrid classifiers that we developed by combining conventional algorithms with bagging and boosting techniques. Metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the model, including accuracy, error rate, negative predictive value, F1 score, precision, sensitivity, false negative rate, and false positive rate. Our findings show that the RFBM model and Relief feature selection together produced the best accuracy, surpassing 97%.

AB  - Machine Learning has evolved significantly over the last decade, with models capable of robust and accurate predictions over data of various categories. The impact is rather big in the field of Healthcare. However, deployment of small, energy-efficient models remains a goal pursued by researchers across the field. Furthermore, the model inferences are hard to interpret and draw conclusions from, especially in healthcare, where its very important to know how the diagnosis decision was passed and what factors are causing the issues. In this paper, we address both of these shortcomings, where we develop a neuromorphic computing based machine learning model, namely an SNN, and using SHAP, LIME, and eli5 explainability techniques to explain the predictions of the Spiking Neural Network. The proposed SNN performs at an accuracy of 85.06%, better than the deep neural network by 5.73% for the Diabetes dataset and at an accuracy of 97.83% for the Mobile Health dataset, thereby mitigating the issue of both lack of performance-cum-efficiency, as well as uninterpretability of these machine learning models.

AB  - Schizophrenia exists as a challenging neurological condition that produces major effects on mental health and intellectual ability. The current diagnostic methods display low accuracy levels combined with poor interpretability so deep learning methods must be developed for proper risk assessment. The proposed model combines CNNs with Transformers and implements SHAP values and attention maps for improving model interpretability. A combination of EEG MRI and genetic biomarkers made up the schizophrenia dataset that served for both model training and testing operations. The experimental findings showed 92.4% accuracy together with 91.2% precision while recall reached 90.7% under tests that produced an AUC-ROC value of 95.8% which exceeded existing benchmark models. Through this framework, healthcare professionals obtain clinically meaningful explanations regarding biomarkers that affect schizophrenia diagnosis determination. The proposed method demonstrates better diagnostic reliability and transparency than standard deep learning techniques operate today. It indicates explainable AI systems help close the gap between deep learning approaches and clinical decisions leading to better understanding and effective application of schizophrenia risk assessment by medical personnel.

AB  - Such advancement of deep learning models, especially in the recurrent neural networks in the medical diagnostics had been very potent to predict the diagnoses of several diseases, including the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), though such dark-box nature of RNN also hampers in terms of its model interpretability, that is indispensable for the clinical area. A proposed study is the integration of newly devised explainability techniques, such as attention mechanisms, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), and Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), with RNNs to predict ALS diagnosis. On the dataset of 1,500 patient records suffering from ALS, it was observed that the model increased its transparency to 25%, with 85% accuracy in prediction and 90% user satisfaction in the clinical scenario. This conclusion opens the way for the potential of explainable RNNs in the improvement of ALS diagnosis and decision-making.

AB  - This study aims to apply machine learning (ML) methods to accurately predict kidney stones by utilizing essential clinical parameters. Kidney stones are a prevalent and painful urological disorder that has repercussions on patient health and healthcare expenditure. Tried and true diagnostics methods, such as imaging, are often expensive and require time. A robust predictive framework has been developed in this study based on a dataset that has six essential clinical features (gravity, pH, osmolality, conductivity, urea, and calcium). As preparation for effective modeling, multiple preprocessing techniques like outlier detection, feature scaling, and balancing of data with the help of SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) were applied. We trained and optimized multiple machine learning algorithms using hyperparameter tuning, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and Extra Trees Classifier. Out of all models, the Extra Trees Classifier has shown to be the most effective, registering an accuracy of 92.5% with a high ROC-AUC of 0.96, which indicates excellent discriminatory ability. To improve the interpretability of the predictions and shed light on important factors leading to predictions, interpretability techniques were utilized including SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to identify drivers in the formation of kidney stones. The strongest predictors identified were calcium, osmolality, and urea. In the future, we plan to include additional clinical and genetic information to improve the proposed system’s predictive capability and real-world applicability.

AB  - Diabetes risk assessment is a key task in healthcare, aiming to identify individuals at risk and initiate early interventions to slow disease progression. Diabetes remains a critical global health concern, necessitating early and accurate diagnostic tools to mitigate long-term complications. This study proposes an enhanced diabetes prediction framework utilizing ensemble machine learning classifiers, explainable AI (XAI), and oversampling technique-SMOTE to address data imbalance. Leveraging the PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset, the study conducts extensive preprocessing, including outlier handling, skewness correction using Box-Cox transformation, and feature selection via ANOVA F -score. Ensemble classifiers-Random Forest, Extra Trees, Voting, and Stacking were evaluated using evaluation metrics. Among these, the Extra Trees Classifier achieved the highest accuracy of 96.58%, while Random Forest demonstrated strong AUC-ROC performance. Explainable AI technique-SHAP was employed to interpret model predictions and identify key influencing features, such as glucose levels, BMI, and age. The results confirm that ensemble models, when integrated with robust preprocessing and interpretability techniques, significantly enhance the reliability and transparency of diabetes diagnosis. This research highlights that Ensemble classifiers are increasingly being used for diabetes diagnosis, employing machine learning methods to improve accuracy and enable early detection. The integration of oversampling (SMOTE), ensemble learning, and explainable AI significantly improved model performance and interpretability, demonstrating strong potential for clinical decision support systems in diabetes diagnosis.

AB  - Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a major global health issue which is affecting million people around the world and with increasing rate of mortality. Mitigation of progression of CKD and better patient outcomes requires early detection. Nevertheless, limitations lie in traditional diagnostic methods, especially in resource constrained settings. This study proposes an advanced machine learning approach to enhance CKD detection by evaluating four models: Random Forest (RF), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Logistic Regression (LR), and a fine-tuned CatBoost algorithm. Specifically, among these, the fine-tuned CatBoost model demonstrated the best overall performance having an accuracy of 98.75%, an AUC of 0.9993 and a Kappa score of 97.35% of the studies. The proposed CatBoost model has used a nature inspired algorithm such as Simulated Annealing to select the most important features, Cuckoo Search to adjust outliers and grid search to fine tune its settings in such a way to achieve improved prediction accuracy. Features significance is explained by SHAP-a well-known XAI technique-for gaining transparency in the decision-making process of proposed model and bring up trust in diagnostic systems. Using SHAP, the significant clinical features were identified as specific gravity, serum creatinine, albumin, hemoglobin, and diabetes mellitus. The potential of advanced machine learning techniques in CKD detection is shown in this research, particularly for low income and middle-income healthcare settings where prompt and correct diagnoses are vital. This study seeks to provide a highly accurate, interpretable, and efficient diagnostic tool to add to efforts for early intervention and improved healthcare outcomes for all CKD patients.

AB  - The major contributor to global mortality is cardiovascular disease, posing a formidable challenge to the global healthcare system. Heart disease often develops and progresses without noticeable symptoms, emphasizing the need for earlier detection to prevent severe outcomes. AI models provide tools for accurate diagnosis, data analysis, and predictive diagnosis of people who may be suffering from heart disease. But increasingly, solutions like Explainable AI (XAI) are gaining traction. XAI demystifies the decisions of AI models, making them transparent and understandable to the point where they boost confidence in the context of AI diagnostics by healthcare professionals; the AI then provides support to professionals to decide the best course of action for each patient based on the analysis. XAI techniques such as SHAP, LIME, QLattice and Anchor are popular, and have been used in this study. We analysed a heart disease dataset collected from a multispecialty hospital in India, which is publicly available on Mendeley. We used ML models, including RF, Logistic Regression, KNN, XGBoost, DT and SVM. These models were optimized and stack-ensembled to form the ‘CARDIACX’ model to predict the risk of heart disease. The models were fine-tuned using Grid Search, Random Search, and Bayesian Optimization methods, achieving promising results with Random Forest achieving an AUC =0.99 and accuracy of 98.5%, outperforming all the other models and demonstrating robust performance on various metrics such as AUC, PR Curve, Log Loss, Jaccard Score, and MCC. This study provides a reliable and transparent framework for early detection of heart disease, providing useful information and enabling patients to receive timely and personalized care.

AB  - Multi-label disease prediction is a highly significant task in healthcare, which essentially encompasses cases where several diseases may occur simultaneously, in a patient. The prediction accuracy suffers due to the fact that traditional models such as rule-based systems and decision trees together with Naïve Bayes fail to recognize symptom dependencies and imbalanced datasets. To this end, this study proposes a reliable machine learning system using the CatBoost, MLP, and Stacking Classifiers. On the same, the result obtained by the model Stacking Classifier is the best with an accuracy of 99.50%. This study greatly contributes to the development of multi-disease prediction systems: early detection, therapy preparation, and better outcomes.

AB  - Ear diseases remain a significant public health concern worldwide, with conditions such as otitis media, cholesteatoma, and tympanic membrane perforation contributing to hearing loss, communication difficulties, and reduced quality of life. Timely and accurate diagnosis is critical to preventing complications, yet conventional diagnostic methods in otolaryngology such as otoscopy, otoendoscopy, and imaging techniques often rely heavily on the expertise of specialists and are prone to variability between observers. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising solution to address these limitations, particularly through the application of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. This review surveys the current state of research focused on the classification and prediction of ear diseases using advanced computational approaches. Emphasis is placed on the evolution of model architectures, the emergence of otoscopic and otoendoscopic image datasets, evaluation methodologies, and the clinical applicability of automated systems. Special prominence is given to the shift from traditional ML models to modern DL frameworks, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) and attention-based architectures, which demonstrate superior accuracy and generalizability. Additional strategies, including data augmentation, ensemble modeling, and incorporation of clinical metadata, are explored for their role in improving diagnostic precision. Synthesizing recent developments provides a comprehensive overview of how data-driven methods are transforming diagnostic workflows in otolaryngology. Ongoing challenges such as limited dataset diversity and model interpretability are also addressed, along with future directions for research, cross-disciplinary collaboration, and clinical deployment of AI in ear disease diagnosis.

AB  - Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is advancing toward human-like cognition, yet ensuring ethical decisionmaking remains a significant challenge due to bias, accountability concerns, and the lack of real-time auditing mechanisms. This research proposes a real-time ethical monitoring framework that integrates explainable AI (XAI), reinforcement learning-based ethical modeling, and adversarial robustness techniques to enhance transparency, fairness, and accountability in AGI-driven decision-making. Utilizing graph neural networks (GNNs), t-SNE embeddings, and federated learning, the framework continuously audits AGI models across diverse high-risk domains such as finance and healthcare. Experimental results show a 29% improvement in ethical compliance, a 23% reduction in bias, and a 35% increase in interpretability compared to baseline AI systems. The adaptive self-learning mechanism ensures real-time anomaly detection without significant computational overhead. This study sets a new benchmark for scalable, real-time AGI auditing, paving the way for responsible AI governance. Future work will explore quantum AI integration and decentralized AGI monitoring using blockchain for enhanced security and trustworthiness.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that developed over time due to the progressive loss of neurons, which are responsible for producing dopamine. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that helps to regulate motor functions. Deficiency of dopamine causes symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, and slowness of movements. In PD, the brain cells in the substantia nigra region responsible for the production of dopamine slowly die off. There are several ways to identify PD, such as gait analysis, neuroimaging techniques, and voice pattern recognition. Additionally, PD can be effectively detected using handwriting by examining different patterns such as spirals, digits, waves, and other structured drawing tasks. In this work, we proposed a PD detection method using an ensemble machine learning (ML) approach i.e. Extra Tree (ET) classifier, combined with explainability techniques. The model utilized handwriting patterns including spirals, loops, meanders, and digits collected using mobile devices providing accurate predictions and interpretable insights into key features influencing the classification. To increase the model performance and robustness, data augmentation techniques such as rotation, zooming, width and height shifting, and horizontal flipping were applied to the image data, complemented by preprocessing steps to normalize and structure the data. These steps significantly contributed to achieving an accuracy of 89.27%. The combination of preprocessing, augmentation, and the robust ML model ensures reliable and interpretable detection of PD based on handwriting patterns. Early detection may help specialists provide individual treatment plans to reduce the wearing-off (WO) phenomenon.

AB  - This study critically examines the commonly held assumption that explicability in artificial intelligence (AI) systems inherently boosts user trust. Utilizing a meta-analytical approach, we conducted a comprehensive examination of the existing literature to explore the relationship between AI explainability and trust. Our analysis, incorporating data from 90 studies, reveals a statistically significant but moderate positive correlation between the explainability of AI systems and the trust they engender among users. This indicates that while explainability contributes to building trust, it is not the sole or predominant factor in this equation. In addition to academic contributions to the field of Explainable AI (XAI), this research highlights its broader socio-technical implications, particularly in promoting accountability and fostering user trust in critical domains such as healthcare and justice. By addressing challenges like algorithmic bias and ethical transparency, the study underscores the need for equitable and sustainable AI adoption. Rather than focusing solely on immediate trust, we emphasize the normative importance of fostering authentic and enduring trustworthiness in AI systems.

AB  - Blockchain Technology (BT) is a promising approach for building scalable & reliable open Decision Support Systems and Artificial Intelligence (AI) could be integrated with BT to present a better approach towards the same. Transparency, trust, data security, and scalability are traditionally regarded as the major deficiencies of DSS models which may impede their efficacy in critical decision-making environments. Seamlessly integrating blockchain with AI-powered DSS can help with data integrity, as well as prevent manipulation and inconsistencies while improving trust with many different stakeholders, because all transactions on a blockchain are transparent immutable, owing to blockchain's decentralized ledger system. The paper investigates a hybrid Blockchain-AI framework that can overcome the main drawbacks of existing DSS systems. This means that AI predictive analytics and machine learning models can match massive datasets for decision making, while blockchain guarantees the integrity, traceability, and decentralization of the data's inputs and outputs. Smart contracts: automate decision processes & ensure tamper-proof execution for defined set of rules & policies In addition, blockchain consensus mechanisms (e.g., Proof-of-Stake, Byzantine Fault Tolerance) can facilitate transparency and verifiability, thus improving conflict-avoiding distributed decision-making. To enable privacy-preserving collaboration between organizations, we introduce a new Decentralized AI Decision Support System (Dai-DSS) framework that integrates federated learning and a distributed ledger. It enables real-time data sharing while preserving data sovereignty, which helps organizations comply with regulatory standards such as GDRP and HIPAA. We are also looking at various optimization techniques such as off-chain scaling solutions (sidechains, Layer-2 protocols, etc.) that improve system efficiency while still keeping the system decentralized. Our research shows that by comparing with the traditional DSS models, the Blockchain-AI integration strengthens system resilience, improves the elimination of single point failure and facilitates open, trustless decision-making processes. Practical applications and the benefits of the proposed model are demonstrated through case studies in healthcare, finance, and supply chain management. Lastly, we address the challenges including computational overhead, interoperability and regulatory challenges, and suggest future research avenues on AI-augmented consensus algorithms and quantum-resistant cryptography. The research demonstrates the ability of Blockchain-AI synergy to revolutionize decision-making systems through decentralized, clean, and scalable operating frameworks across industries.

AB  - Tumor detection and diagnosis through medical imaging remains an area of concern considering the difficulty posed by the intricacy and differences in the tumor configuration across subjects. This study proposes an approach that leverages deep learning with the YOLO (You Only Look Once) architecture for rapid and precise identification of brain tumors in MRI scans. Unlike traditional models that classify images, real-time object detection systems, as with YOLO, make it possible for clinical practices that demand both speed and accuracy to easily and reliably use the system. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is added to the framework to improve trust and reliability. With these techniques, such as visual saliency maps and feature attribution, clinicians can understand the rationale the model used in making the predictions by showing the areas that are most important to the particular outcome. The proposed method is performed on a large dataset of MRI images with diverse tumor types and anatomical variations for training and validation. Performance is measured using standard metrics like precision, recall, F1 score, and inference time; explaining how the results were attained is assessed through visualization and feedback from domain experts. The findings show that the model based on YOLO has superior accuracy in detection and takes less time to process when juxtaposed with traditional methods. In addition, the interpretable results provided by the system’s explainability increases understandability which allows medics to appreciate and trust the AI’s reasoning. This study illustrates the practicality and significance of merging sophisticated object detection frameworks with explainable artificial intelligence towards reliable, efficient, and clinically applicable systems for brain tumor diagnosis.

AB  - Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and globally affects both genders. The disease arises due to abnormal growth of tissue formed of malignant cells. Early detection of breast cancer is crucial for enhancing the survival rate. Therefore, artificial intelligence has revolutionized healthcare and can serve as a promising tool for early diagnosis. The present study aims to develop a machine-learning model to classify breast cancer and to provide explanations for the model results. This could improve the understanding of the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer by identifying the most important features of breast cancer tumors and the way they affect the classification task. The best-performing machine-learning model has achieved an accuracy of 97.7% using k-nearest neighbors and a precision of 98.2% based on the Wisconsin breast cancer dataset and an accuracy of 98.6% using the artificial neural network with 94.4% precision based on the Wisconsin diagnostic breast cancer dataset. Hence, this asserts the importance and effectiveness of the proposed approach. The present research explains the model behavior using model-agnostic methods, demonstrating that the bare nuclei feature in the Wisconsin breast cancer dataset and the area’s worst feature Wisconsin diagnostic breast cancer dataset are the most important factors in determining breast cancer malignancy. The work provides extensive insights into the particular characteristics of the diagnosis of breast cancer and suggests possible directions for expected investigation in the future into the fundamental biological mechanisms that underlie the disease’s onset. The findings underline the potential of machine learning to enhance breast cancer diagnosis and therapy planning while emphasizing the importance of interpretability and transparency in artificial intelligence-based healthcare systems.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of global death, with approximately 80% of such CVD mortalities occurring in low and middle-income regions. Early detection of cardiac abnormalities is essential for timely intervention and minimizing mortalities. Automated CVD detection methods are vital, particularly in areas with limited healthcare resources. However, most existing AI-based techniques lack three critical aspects: model interpretability, longer-duration analysis, and effective use of nonlinear time-frequency approaches, which are necessary for ECG signals due to their nonlinear, nonstationary, and multi-component nature. This study proposes explainable intelligent classifiers incorporated with a novel sequence of time-frequency energy Gini Index (GI) features from the QRS complexes of ECG signals to address these challenges and enable early-stage CVD detection. These features are extracted using the Choi-Williams Time-Frequency method, reporting the first instance application of GI measures to nonlinear time-frequency distribution (TFD) for ECG analysis. Features are computed from one-minute windows, covering 30 minutes of ECG recordings. These interpretable features provide clear insights into normal and abnormal ECG patterns. The proposed method was trained and validated using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia and Fantasia-Normal databases. Eight machine learning classifiers, including SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, KNN, LinearBoost, CatBoost, and Logistic Regression were tested. The best model achieved 100% sensitivity, 94.4% accuracy, 95.24% F1-score, 90% precision, and 92.59% AUC on the test dataset. High sensitivity ensures reliability for medical screening by reducing False Negatives, making the approach suitable for integration into any type of smart device for accurate online and offline monitoring of CVD abnormalities.

AB  - Hypertension, a worldwide health issue, increases the risk of serious cardiovascular illnesses, whether untreated or undetected. The proposed prediction framework uses classical machine learning algorithms and Explainable AI (XAI)-enhanced ensemble learning to improve the diagnosis and understanding of high blood pressure risk factors. The dataset is available on the Kaggle titled "Diabetes, Hypertension, and Stroke Prediction repository", and consists of 26,083 samples with 14 clinical factors. Hypertension was predicted using traditional machine learning models such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting, and AdaBoost. Besides, an ensemble approach: voting classifier is introduced, combining the individual models to enhance performance. Experimental data indicate that the Voting Classifier, Random Forest, and Decision Tree obtained a perfect accuracy of 100%, topping other models, while Gradient Boosting and Support Vector Machine achieved 97.6% and 99.9% accuracy, respectively. The Area Under the Curve scores further confirmed the robustness of the models. To ensure the model’s transparency, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) plots were applied, highlighting significant factors impacting hypertension prediction. The SHAP summary and decision plot added greater insights into the decision-making process, assuring dependability in healthcare applications. The results conclude that machine learning and ensemble approaches can successfully detect hypertension with high accuracy, while XAI techniques provide the model’s interpretability. Additionally, the proposed framework highlights the potential of AI-driven diagnostics in assisting early hypertension identification, which may lead to better disease prediction and faster medical intervention.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed medical diagnostics. Its opaque nature raises concerns about trust. This research focuses on explainable AI models for diagnosing COVID-19 using chest X-ray images. Deep learning models trained on labelled X-ray datasets are used for classification tasks. The Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) method is applied to generate visual explanations by highlighting relevant regions in the images. Additionally, the LIME technique is utilized to provide local explanations for individual predictions. These interpretability techniques aim to improve the understanding of AI decision-making. The proposed achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 94.29% with precision of 94% and recall of 93%. Grad-CAM offers insights into the reasoning behind each prediction. Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) complements this by explaining individual features that contribute to the diagnosis. These approaches help bridge the gap between model performance and human trust. Explainable AI increases transparency and enhances model reliability. Healthcare professionals can make informed decisions by understanding the AI’s reasoning process. This study shows that combining deep learning and interpretability techniques can build trust in AI systems. The models can be adopted in clinical settings, improving diagnostic workflows. Future research will focus on improving the explain ability of AI models. Incorporating multimodal data, such as CT scans and clinical records, can enhance diagnostic accuracy. Ultimately explainable AI has the potential to revolutionize healthcare by providing more transparent, trustworthy, and effective solutions for clinical decision-making.

AB  - In the rapidly evolving landscape of networking and security, the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) is accelerating to meet the demands of real-time, data-driven applications. Current AI development processes predominantly prioritize model utility metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall, often overlooking critical trustworthiness aspects like accountability, resilience to adversarial attacks, and privacy. To address this gap, we propose a novel AI/Machine Learning (ML) development process that systematically integrates trustworthiness metrics alongside traditional model utility measures. Our process emphasizes the iterative development of trustworthy AI models by balancing performance, accountability, resilience, and privacy through the incorporation of eXplainable AI (XAI) techniques. We validate the effectiveness of our methodology across four distinct networking and security use cases. In encrypted traffic classification, LightGBM emerges as the most practical model, offering a strong balance of utility, accountability, and robustness despite Neural Networks achieving the highest raw performance. For malware detection, feature reduction in the MalDoc model yields a minimal utility loss (<0.7%) while substantially enhancing resilience to evasion attacks (10–80%). In assessing privacy trade-offs in Federated Learning, we observe that although strong differential privacy significantly degrades utility (up to 70% on MNIST), it enables early-stage privacy protection without fully masking poisoned client behaviour, which remains detectable through SHAP and t-SNE-based analysis. Lastly, in a smart healthcare emergency e-call scenario, our 1D CNN model achieves not only strong predictive performance (96.21% accuracy, 91.55% precision, 93.13% recall) but also provides stable and interpretable explanations using LRP and SHAP, with LRP demonstrating higher consistency across ECG segments. Therefore, unlike prior studies that focus on isolated aspects such as accountability or resilience, our work proposes a holistic, quantifiable process that balances the trade-offs among model utility, accountability, resilience, and privacy to support the development of trustworthy AI models in communication systems.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to enhance clinical practice by leveraging the vast amount of clinical data available today. In particular, biomedical imaging analysis plays a crucial role in healthcare, generating extensive datasets that can be used to study complex diseases, track their progression, and even predict their onset. This study focuses on an approach based on Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), a type of generative model that utilizes a parameterized Markov chain and variational inference to generate synthetic samples that closely resemble real data. The model was trained on pneumonia images, producing high-quality synthetic samples to assess the performance of DDPMs by separately analyzing class 0 (healthy) and class 1 (pneumonia) cases. Furthermore, a ResNet-based convolutional neural network was employed for classification tasks to evaluate the effectiveness of DDPMs in generating synthetic images. The classification performance was compared using both real and synthetic images. Additionally, Class Activation Maps (CAM) were applied to provide visual explanations of the classification results, thereby enhancing the interpretability of our findings.

Various ML algorithms (random forest, support vector machines, gradient boosting, and logistic regression) are optimized using feature selection techniques (i.e., RFE and SelectKBest) to enhance diagnostic accuracy. Ensemble models achieve 100% accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of ML in CKD detection. To ensure transparency, explainable AI (XAI) techniques such as SHAP, fuzzy rule-based systems, and decision trees are applied to identify key biomarkers (e.g., hemoglobin, serum creatinine, and specific gravity), making predictions clinically interpretable. The integration of fuzzy logic further aligns model decisions with medical reasoning, enhancing clinician trust. This research bridges the gap between AI predictions and clinical decision-making, contributing to the development of transparent, data-driven clinical decision support systems for early CKD detection, personalized treatment, and improved patient outcomes.

AB  - Public health problem of air pollution is growing close to the respiratory health. In this review, the use of AI driven models to forecast disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is studied in relation to air quality trends and health; in particular, both the disease and exposures are forecast. With this, these models take advantage of the prediction accuracy of air pollution and impacts on health through machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and Internet of things (IoT) based systems. Real time environmental data used by advanced AI techniques are long short term memory (LSTM) networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and hybrid AI-IoT systems. These techniques are discussed in the paper to achieve a more precise forecasting. It reveals how AI can anticipate exacerbations of respiratory diseases, and hospital admissions, and hence extract further information for the individual’s personalized health risk assessment. Furthermore, the review also discusses the impediments in implementing AI based model such as data quality, model interpretability, privacy and fairness. It finally presents research directions to further improve the model transparency, real time data integration, predictive capability refinement to improve public health policies and early intervention for respiratory health.

Quick diagnosis of liver cirrhosis greatly increases the possibility of treating ill ones effectively. Changes in artificial intelligence and machine learning are radically transforming the diagnosis of diseases through automating diagnostics and increasing reliability of early detection, especially for difficult health problems. This paper considers how AI and ML analytics can be applied in assessing clinical and imaging information to promote early identification of cases of liver cirrhosis. This research will highlight the contribution AI- driven approaches make to transparent and reliable healthcare while affording customized diagnostic preparation. Also, the paper briefly addresses the existing barriers, ethics and the moveable steps required to move AI integration forward in the healthcare setting. This is perhaps the first work to include a SHAP-enhanced hybrid stacked ensemble model that not only increases the accuracy of the diagnostic but it also provides model interpretability which is one of the many draw-backs in other current liver cirrhosis detecting systems.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of vision problems and partial blindness, and its signs are complicated and variable, making detection difficult. Standard diagnosis is mainly reliant on expert interpretation of retinal images, which can lead to bias and mistake, highlighting the need for improved diagnostic approaches. Despite the fact that conventional AI technologies considerably improve diagnostic skills, their black box aspect limits healthcare practitioners' confidence and optimizes their usage in practice. Grad-CAM++ is a new technique that addresses the black box problem by improving model knowledge, allowing users to grasp the reasoning behind specific decisions. Using XAI approaches, this work creates a diagnostic model for diagnosing diabetic retinopathy, hence improving transparency. The proposed model's convergent plots validate the learning process, which results in 94.4% better diagnostic precision than previous approaches.

AB  - Ensuring good health and well-being is a key United Nations Sustainable Development Goal. However, rising healthcare costs pose challenges, particularly in the U.S., where spending reached $4.9 trillion in 2023, accounting for 17.6% of GDP. This growing financial burden highlights the need for cost prediction models and improved price transparency. This study addresses two key questions: (1) How can computational models predict healthcare costs accurately? (2) How can price transparency be improved? Using New York SPARCS data, and 2 million deidentifed patient records, we developed machine learning models to forecast treatment costs. Our ensemble-based CatBoost approach reduces prediction error (RMSE) by 55% compared to a single CatBoost model. We also optimize prediction coverage to balance accuracy and usability for hospitals and insurers.
